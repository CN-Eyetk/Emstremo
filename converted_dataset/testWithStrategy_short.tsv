0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how is your day? EOS 0 0 1 Not good. I was told today that my contract is not being renewed once it ends this month. I am very anxious about finding another job during pandemic. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see, It' s been a difficult year for all of us. But I think it would be possible to negotiate. EOS 0 0 3 But I tried negotiating. They are down - sizing the entire sales department. What else can I do? EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Hmmm, I can see that this is stressful for you. Did you already search for a new job? EOS 0 0 5 Yes I am preparing my resume but job vacancies are few and far between. I am worried about my next job. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Okay then, It' s good that you already started. But first of all stop being panicked. EOS 0 0 7 Ok. Do you have any ideas for sales positions? EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Search online and locally, get help from your friends and I assure you if you try hard enough you will suceed. EOS 0 0 9 I will. How can I get help from friends? Only very few are in sales field. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] And remember, what are we if we stop fighting? Your friends can support you emotionally at least and maybe they know a person that could help you. EOS 0 0 11 I agree. I should never give up. But due to financial commitments, I am somewhat afraid of failing. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Life is full of surprises, but we should get advantage of bad situations. It' s totally fine to be afraid, but also at the same time you should try harder to reach your goal. EOS 0 0 13 Yes, so far life has been kind to me even if it surprised me at few places! I will try to make the most of the situation.. You are right! Hard work will pay. I need to pull my socks up... EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Courage is not the absence of the fear, you should fight to find your place. EOS 0 0 15 Sure, after all I am known to be a fighter!. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah that' s the spirit. You can and you should get a job, so start right now! EOS 0 0 17 Yes I will. Thanks a lot for the encouragement! I truly appreciate your motivational words. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Don' t let the stress and fear overcome you, get control and who knows maybe you get a better job. your so welcome dear, I hope I could help you even a little bit.
0 0 0 Hello? Is anyone there? Is anyone there. HELLO? no one is supporting me here..:: twiddles thumbs:: the instructions for the support seeker are incorrect as there is no button that has shown for" the partner' s reasons".. the supporter did not respond. This test is skewed. No one is here to chat with. even after being matched. Ridiculous. hello????? hello? no other messages except my own are showing up. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Sorry, I had a bad connection. Hello, what can I help you with?
3 0 0 Hello. Hello? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hey how are you doing?. EOS 3 0 2 Doing alright, thanks. Yourself? EOS 3 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing fine, thank you.. EOS 3 0 4 Good to hear. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 6 I' ve been feeling very down lately. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] That sounds difficult, Would you like to elaborate on that? EOS 3 0 8 Sure. I feel depressed about the state of the US and of the rest of the world. It' s very overwhelming.. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now. EOS 3 0 10 Yes and a lot of uncetainty. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Most definitely, I' ve also been feeling a bit overwhelmed by what' s going on. How have you been coping?
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state. EOS 0 0 6 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well. EOS 0 0 8 Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing( which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all. I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out. EOS 0 0 10 What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job: it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. Working there would be ministry, not typical work. And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, that' s a big deal. i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it. EOS 0 0 12 Thank you. I believe there are three things in my favor: I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current( related) job fifteen years ago. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] even by working there, you will surely meet new friends. do you know many people from the church? EOS 0 0 14 We worked together for almost 13 years before she retired, but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer/ work partner? I know a few of the higher ups from the area churches, and a handful of families. I know half the core staff I would be working with daily and think of them as extended family.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you just have to be patient and don' t push it too hard so that you won' t look desperate. EOS 0 0 16 The benefits are nice, also, such as staff are provided meals prepared by the banquet chef and his team when at work. And though everyone has a role, the office staff support each other well and work as a team. EOS 0 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, banquet at work. that is a wonderland stuff. EOS 0 0 18 At the risk of preaching religion, I believe God may be calling me to serve there.. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is definitely a dream job. God is everywhere. just put your trust in Him. He never sleep nor slumber. EOS 0 0 20 When off duty, staff are encouraged to enjoy the facilities and mingle with guests. There is an Olympic sized pool, field games, a gymnasium, an exercise room, and if off duty, one can attend most any of the events on the campus, unless designated as a private event. EOS 0 1 21 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow! Olympic size pool. Keep praying. the job is yours. EOS 0 0 22 Because my job is to sell repeat business, it is essential that I get out and meet guests and make certain that their needs are met, but it usually comes in the form of serving snacks at intermission and saying hellos as one passes. It would feel like a family reunion, but in a family where everyone gets along. EOS 0 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] that is good, i work in such place where everyone is like a family.
0 0 0 Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, what seems to be on your mind?.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 Am ok but feeling sad and anxious. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that you are sad and anxious. Do you know what is causing you to feel that way? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I recently lost my childhood best friend to covid 19. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can only imagine how sad you feel from losing your best friend. Hopefully chatting some will help. I know in the past when I lost someone it was nice to just have a conversation to help put my mind at ease.
3 0 0 Hi. I am Mike. Live in central Kansas and have been very depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that, is there a particular reason or instance for you feeling this way? EOS 3 0 2 I lost my job due to Covid and they have shut down for good. no jobs around here and no vehicle so i feel hopeless and hate my living situation. just before covid hit i was saving to move... but then job closed. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes that is a very tough situation, Covid has real placed a large amount of stress through out the world. There may be a ray of hope however with a possible vaccine in the near future, maybe this will be back to normal soon and new jobs will become available. EOS 3 0 4 I hope so and that is what i know mentally. but emotionally it is hard. i just hate having no job, being at home, no money, no vehicle, and a very bad idea to date since there is a high contagious pandemic. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand and you are right it is a a lot of mental stress. Have you reached out to claim unemployment or go to a food pantry? During this pandemic you should not feel shameful to take advantage of these services, there are alot of people who have to ask for help for the first time in their lives. EOS 3 0 6 I did not make enough to get unemployment they said. I have not tried a food pantry but that is a great idea. what makes this difficult is I am in a very small town. like we dont wal marts or McDonalds or anything like that. Whole town closes at 9. the closest actual city is 45 miles away. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well please try the food pantry and see what they have to offer. Is there anyone whom you could ask for a ride in the future when they go to the bigger city? EOS 3 0 8 I will try food pantry. my sister goes to the city once a month, we shop for the month and i stay with my siter. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well its seem that you now have a plan try it out see how it works, hopefully this will get back to normal sooner than later and life may go back to somewhat normal and your stress level and mental exhaustion will also subside. Is there anything else you would like to talk about? EOS 3 0 10 Well I have been wanting a relationship. and i normally dont feel that way at all. and past week i think how much i kind of should have a family as I am 37 but not sure if i truly want that or i just miss human contact as i have only been around family and not gone out at all except to walk and go to store in town, and am confused if it is actully me wanting somone in my life or just a physical thing. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think your exactly right, human contact is now a premium and I' m sure you miss that contact that we were once so use to. Missing the contact makes you realize how much you enjoy the company of others. Take it slow and once the vaccine is out ease your way back into the dating scene and see if a relationship is what you really wanted after all. EOS 3 0 12 yeah i mean emotionally i want to go maybe try a date or two or even just an adult night out but know logically it is a VERY risky idea. And that I need to not do anything like that till next year at the minimum. I do appreciate the advice and ideas. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] Remember that age is only a number and love will no no number, we are hear to listen and support you so if you ever need to talk just know we are a mouse click away. EOS 3 0 14 And appreciate that especially during the current situation. EOS 3 1 15 [Greeting] Your welcome stay strong. EOS 3 0 16 You as well. EOS 3 1 17 [Greeting] Thank you.
2 0 0 hi. EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hey! How are you? EOS 2 0 2 trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once:( EOS 2 1 3 [Question] What are these thoughts?:) EOS 2 0 4 Its so stupid. I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts just come so fast. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while. EOS 2 0 6 tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes I cant controll the thoughts or like I dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing. EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] A chemical thing, so maybe you need a counsellor, and then he can assess your problem, and everything will be alright:) EOS 2 0 8 I have one and it helps sometimes. I try to meditate. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. Does it help you? If it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently. EOS 2 0 10 i pretty much have to do it constantly. EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not constantly. because then you won' t have anytime to do anything else, but if negative thoughts always come into your head, maybe try doing something you enjoy doing.
0 0 0 I am very worried about losing my job. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello - How are you today?
6 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there! How may I support you? EOS 6 0 2 Well, I' m really upset with my friends. EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I am so sorry to hear that. Did something happen? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, they aren' t taking COVID seriously. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns? EOS 6 0 6 Yes but they get angry with me. I don' t know how to get through to them, EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It' s also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right. EOS 6 0 8 I really don' t know I just haven' t been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out. It' s a weird dynamic. EOS 6 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you' re finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it' s the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right? EOS 6 0 10 That' s exactly right. EOS 6 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is such a hard position to be in. it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance. EOS 6 0 12 I' d like to think so but I wish they would too. It' s hard to know what is right. EOS 6 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have found that having vitural movie nights, or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected. Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try? EOS 6 0 14 Yes, but they' ll have their BBQs and parties anyway. They are having a group Thanksgiving and there will be a lot of people there. My husband and I feel bad that we aren' t going, but we also know it isn' t smart. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can' t live your life in fear, and that they' re going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware. EOS 6 0 16 We feel like after this is all over, they will still remind us that we were standoffish during this time. And I agree. The longer we put it off and don' t take it seriously, the longer it will last. EOS 6 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Can you tell them that that just isn' t the case? You and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others. If I am correct, it has nothing to do with the fact that you don' t want to see your pals and family! From chatting with you it sounds like your relationships with these people is incredibly important to you. EOS 6 0 18 Yes that' s totally accurate. Yes they are. They are good people. They just think living for the moment is the bigger picture. EOS 6 1 19 [Greeting] I hope your friends can see how important they are to you and thats a huge reason why you' re not seeing them. EOS 6 0 20 I think they do. They just think that this is a hoax. EOS 6 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I know a lot of people that think the same thing. I have one friend who thought that, and they ended up contracting COVID. Thankfully she was ok, but after she got it she definitely didn' t think it was a hoax anymore. I hope they understand the risk they are taking. EOS 6 0 22 That' s scary. Yeah I don' t think they get it. EOS 6 1 23 [Greeting] I am proud of the choices you are making and I hope you can take some comfort in knowing that you are doing your part in helping keep things under control. There is a strength in numbers and the more people who understand that the faster it can be controlled. EOS 6 0 24 Thank you. I hope it gets better. But anyway thank you for giving me the chance to open up. EOS 6 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes of course, I hope this was helpful. You are doing the best you can and take pride in knowing that.:)
6 0 0 hi my friend. EOS 6 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] Hello! How are you doing? EOS 6 0 2 feeling very shame. EOS 6 1 3 [Question] Oh my god! What happened? EOS 6 0 4 i have cheated on my girlfriend. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel sorry for you.. What was the reason behind that? I understand how you are feeling right now. EOS 6 0 6 me and my girlfriend mom had an physical relationship but till now my girlfriend belives im good guy. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Calm down friend. EOS 6 0 8 what should i do now. EOS 6 1 9 [Question] Can i know the reason why you got attracted to her mom when she herself is there? Chill out friend, feel good atleast now you have realised your mistake. Whatever happened has happened, forget everything. EOS 6 0 10 i have gone to her home. her mom taken advantage to me what should i dothat time so we did it. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand, so now forget from beng guilty. EOS 6 0 12 but till now my girlfriend dont know about it but her mom is now targeting me for her sexual desire. EOS 6 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You have got such a nice girlfriend, have a happy life with her. EOS 6 0 14 but think about her mom how could i handle her. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Dont worry, just tell your girlfriend directly about the incident of how her mom is behaving towards you with a proof if you could. Or else be bold enough to warn her mom regarding this. EOS 6 0 16 yes im going to warn her. EOS 6 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] You have such a nice girlfriend my dear friend, so cheating her is not at all fair. Yes, go ahead, the problems will vanish. EOS 6 0 18 yeah i can understand. EOS 6 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] And i believe you too are good, as you have realised your mistake, so stop worrying or feeling guilty for the act. Be happy:) EOS 6 0 20 sure i will try to solve my problem. EOS 6 1 21 [Others] Thats the spirit:) EOS 6 0 22 give any tips to warn her my friend. EOS 6 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Just be bold enough, dont get aroused or attracted to her by any way even though she' s seducing you, be harsh towards her, because you will have to teach a better lesson to her. Tell her, if she repeats this, then you are either gonna tell it to your girlfriend or either file a complaint against her.
2 0 0 hi. EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hey! How are you? EOS 2 0 2 trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once:( EOS 2 1 3 [Question] What are these thoughts?:)
4 1 0 [Question] HI there, How are you doing today? EOS 4 0 1 Its hard for me to find a job. things could be doing better. it' s been a bad week for me. EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] I understand that, it is hard to find a job. I got terminated during the beginning of covid. EOS 4 0 3 Yea, i got laid off in July. the market has been tough. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I actually took a job at walmart just to make ends meet. Not the best situation but hey, my family can eat. EOS 4 0 5 thats good. i' m an engineer and i would like to take another engineering role. but they are hard to come by now adays. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea, would you consider doing something lesser for now just to make sure you have some income coming in? Or do you still collect unemployment at least? EOS 4 0 7 yes, i still get some unemployment which helps. i' ve done many interviews. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Thats good at least. Well, its great you are being proactive about it! I hate saying this but, just hang in there and keep moving on. EOS 4 0 9 yes. so i' m hoping to find something soon before the holidays. yes thank you. i just want to be able to buy presents for my family. and make it to 2021. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] I hear ya, im doing everything i can to make a bit of extra money just so my kid can have a semi normal christmas!
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 3 0 2 Not feeling good. Trying to find a job but no success. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] It' s a really hard time to be finding new work isn' t it? Are you getting unemployment or anything? EOS 3 0 4 I am getting unemployment but that is not sufficient with 6 children. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wow that' s a lot of kids. Do you know that there are foodbanks out there which might be able to help you?
4 0 0 Hi I am so sad my boyfriend was cheating and broke up with me when I found out. I don' t think I can ever be happy again. EOS 4 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self - esteem is that true?
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you? EOS 1 0 2 Not so good. How are you doing? EOS 1 1 3 [Question] I am doing okay thank you for asking! would you like to talk about whats wrong?
4 1 0 [Question] how are yo. EOS 4 0 1 Good how are you. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] ok. thanks for asking. what on your mind. EOS 4 0 3 Just been having a rough time.... recently broke up with my girlfriend. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] sounds hard. are you doing anything to help. EOS 4 0 5 Trying to avoid thoughts about her, but every where on social media she is posting about her new guy. It is hard to escape the sadness. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow. in our connected world it is hard to get away. do you want to tell me how it happened. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah it is. Well we have been having trouble staying closely connected since the lockdown. We tried to make time for one another, but it has been tough. I was the one who broke things off because I know longer felt much love coming from her. I felt neglected and I thought a break up was the best solution. I did not think she would pick up a new guy two weeks later. I was not prepared to deal with this kind of pain and it hurts. EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It was wise of you to know your feeling towards the relationship and make a mature decision for the both of you. During this pandemic too. that must have been even harder.. EOS 4 0 9 Yeah it has been difficult and I know I will make it through. It is just difficult to get through break ups these days. Unless you disconnect you can' t avoid the other person. EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] that' s a good idea. Have you thought about disconnecting? EOS 4 0 11 Yeah I was thinking of maybe organizing a hunting/ fishing/ camping trip with my buddies over winter break. That could help get me out of the digital world and would help me spend quality time with my friends. EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] nothing better than the outdoors wit h some friends. Fresh air can really clear the mind. EOS 4 0 13 Yeah I think that is probably what I will end up doing. It will probably help the mental health of the entire friend group, but especially me right now. EOS 4 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] perspective is found from looking at things from a distance. you maybe to close to everything right now to see the forest from the trees.
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one. EOS 4 0 16 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. What else can I do besides meditation? EOS 4 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds? EOS 4 0 18 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. Candles are much better for me. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil. EOS 4 0 20 I haven' t heard of that website before. I' ll have to check it out. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships. EOS 4 0 22 Well, I haven' t been in a long - term relationship like this before.. My past relationships were all in high school, and they only lasted a few weeks or months at a time. I really cared for this one, and we were together for so long. EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] I feel obligated to help during Christmas because I had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts. EOS 4 0 24 You had a fight with your partner? I' m sorry, it' s the worst when people fight over what' s supposed to be something nice. EOS 4 1 25 [Question] What was the fight over? Food? Money? Sex? EOS 4 0 26 I forget what started it, it was something stupid. He didn' t like the way I said something and it kind of blew up from there. We were fighting over the smallest things these last few months. It just kind of built up to the point where he said he couldn' t take fighting with me anymore and just wanted to end it. EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would let things decompress for a long while. EOS 4 0 28 End the relationship, I mean. You think maybe if we just take some time apart, he might want to talk about it? EOS 4 1 29 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest thinking through ending the relationship if he has a hot temper..
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! How are you doing? EOS 0 0 1 im ok kinda stressed. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Anything I can help with:)? Feeling stressed is never fun:( What has been making you feel stressed? EOS 0 0 3 im feeling very overwhelmed and cant get anything done cause i dont know where to start! i want to declutter my house but dont know where to start. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I hear you, feeling overwhelmed and like you don' t know where to start can leave a person feeling stressd forsure! Decluttering sounds like a great idea! Sometimes taking baby steps is a good place to start! EOS 0 0 5 but there are so many thinggs to do and ideas i have. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Of course! It can feel so stressful when we have all these little things we want to do but don' t know where to start! EOS 0 0 7 should i start in one room or one group of things and collect them from all the rooms? EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What is one little area that maybe seems easier to start with? Yeah, that' s a great idea! EOS 0 0 9 well i seem to start and them i end up jumoing to another thing! jumping. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, well that' s okay! starting is half the battle, so that' s an accomplishment right there! EOS 0 0 11 thanx that helps cause i start feeling defeated. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried maybe using a timer or making a list to help keep you focused on decluttering one area at a time? Of course! It' s easy to be hard on ourselves, but just the fact that you are trying is so important!

3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there how can be of help? EOS 3 0 2 I am suffering from low mood and general depression. I don' t know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down( obviously) and there doesn' t appear to be any real reason behind it. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue? EOS 3 0 4 I felt this way for a while actually isn' t a recent change it' s been building slowly over time. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same? EOS 3 0 6 I think I know what you mean. It' s getting worse. I feel very down. EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse. EOS 3 0 8 Yeah. I worry that I' ll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. I' m really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Firstly, you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with depression and it' s good that you have reached out for help for this. EOS 3 0 10 Any suggestions on what to do about it? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many reasons people have depression. It is a recognised medical condition and the good news is that there is help out there. The first step is recognising the problem. EOS 3 0 12 Ok well there is definitely a problem. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Have you spoken to friends and family about this? do they know how much you are struggling with it at the moment? EOS 3 0 14 not really I don' t want to bother other people with my problems. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. I think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help. EOS 3 0 16 Yeah maybe. I suppose nobody really understands but I could at least speak to them about it. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] everyone has problems and it is good to talk about them because a problem shared is a problem halved. It doesn' t mean the problems will go away but it might help you understand them and then be able to deal with them better. EOS 3 0 18 I don' t want to feel like this anymore. I' m willing to at least give it a go. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also think that it will be worse to get in touch with your doctor or a medical professional. these people are trained to deal with problems like yours and will be able to offer effective Solutions from a medical perspective. EOS 3 0 20 I haven' t spoken to a doctor about this before to be clear I don' t want any medication. EOS 3 1 21 [Question] are you worried that speaking to a doctor will lead to you being given medication, and you don' t want this? EOS 3 0 22 yes that' s right I don' t want to take any pills or anything like that. EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know that some forms of depression are caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain and medication in these cases can help. Also psychologists can support with mental health which means that this would not be a rude day involves any medication at all potentially.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, my name is Rose, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi Rose. I' m ok, but I get embarrassed about my curly hair. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What about your hair is embarrasing exactly? Curls seem like a lovely thing to have( mine is dead straight, lets trade lol) But no, seriously, what in particular don' t you like about it? i admire people who have natural curls. EOS 4 0 3 They are unruly and not the pretty kind of curls. Often get frizzy by the end of the day. It get' s frustrating when I always look a mess. EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I could see that being frustrating, if you can' t keep them neat. is your hair short or long? EOS 4 0 5 It is long. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you thought of having it shorter, it might be easier to tame? Just a thought.... you say you always look like a mess... is that your personal opinion or has anyone else commented on your hair? EOS 4 0 7 I started to cut it shorter last time, but my stylist said it would be big. It is hard to find the right product.. It is my personal opinion.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you asked a friend for an honest opinion? EOS 4 0 9 My friend likes my hair, but also says she can see that it is hard to manage. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance.. EOS 4 0 11 I can totally relate to that. I think we always want what we dont have. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One thing I have started doing, since my hair hasn' t been cut for a year due to pandemic, is wearing hats. my hair is driving me crazy, so I get your frustration. Is it long enough to braid? EOS 4 0 13 I went a year without cutting mine as well for the same reason. That is probably why it felt so out of control now that you say that. Now that I am vaccinated I just got it cut. Maybe I will like it better now. Yes, I do like braids. That is a good idea. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] yay! a haircut!!! Congrats.
2 0 0 Good afternoon/ evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you tonight?
4 0 0 Hello. Is anyone there. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you today? EOS 4 0 2 I' m doing good. I need some advice. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] What can I help you with? EOS 4 0 4 Lately, my friends started to make jokes about my face being ugly. They even called my face as flat as a pan! What should I do? I see them everyday on the bus. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried confronting them and asking why they are being bullies? EOS 4 0 6 I did and they respond by saying that they are just joking and that I' m handsome. But it' s starting to get on my nerves because it' s all they make fun about every time they see me! EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you are very handsome! They could just be jealous. EOS 4 0 8 Haha I would hope so. Still though, it makes me want to avoid them when I go to school on the bus. What do you think I should do then? EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I understand, school was tough for me too. I suggest you tell them to knock it off or you can sit somewhere away from the bus. EOS 4 0 10 Should I just beat them up with my backpack. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No, beating them up will only get you in trouble and that won' t help. EOS 4 0 12 There' s another bus route. Should I just take that instead. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that could be a good idea if it' s not too far out of your way. EOS 4 0 14 I think I will. Their comments make me very insecure. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could also tell a teacher what is happening. They will help you out. I bet you are handsome! Don' t let it get to you. EOS 4 0 16 The teacher would probably make fun of me!. Thanks it' s hard to look in the mirror now. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try to tell yourself you are good looking and deserve good things to happen every morning! Look in that mirror and tell yourself good things. EOS 4 0 18 I' ll try to be positive for once. Do you believe working out will help. EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] Working out will help a lot! When I was feeling down on myself I decided to go to the gym three times a week. It was a great confidence boost.
4 1 0 [Question] What is going on today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling really down about my breakup. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] \ So you have had a breakup recently and you are feeling down about it.
1 0 0 I' m having issues with my parents. You can say we are having a conflict. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] What kind of issues do you think you are having? EOS 1 0 2 well they won' t allow me to date this girl i met online.. They told she' s bad news. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today. Have you tried talking to you parents about why she is" bad news"? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, i tried but it won' t get through their head. There are so old school. They want me to date someone close to my age. is 15 year difference too big of a gap? EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] The basic problem is that your parents believe that 15 years is too large of an age gap between you guys. Is there any other reasons your parents dissaporve of her? EOS 1 0 6 They told me she' s gold digger. Yes i come from money but hey this girl is the one.. EOS 1 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You believe that the girl is not a gold digger, but instead you guys like each other for who you are. Money is not an issue for you guys? EOS 1 0 8 nope not at all. hmm well she does ask to use my credit card alot. my parents foot the bill.. EOS 1 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps you should try to talk to your parents around this fact. For example, if money is the problem for your parents, you can set some rules. LIke you can set an allowance for how much money you can use each week. EOS 1 0 10 Ok, i will talk to them this weekend. what' s better on the phone or in person? EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you want a better communication, I believe in person will be best. EOS 1 0 12 hate talking to my parents face to face, all they do is yell and i get frustrated. EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I apologize and I do agree it is sometimes difficult. Perhaps it will be better to talk to them with another person present. EOS 1 0 14 That' s a great idiea. i will bring my g. f or is that a bad idea?. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If another person is present, it may make it easier. However, I believe it should be someone that is not invovled in this issue. Perhaps another family member or a close family friend.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi! What' s on your mind tonight?. EOS 4 0 1 I think a friend I' ve known for 30 years since college has drifted away from me. Even during the pandemic she has made new friends. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, I' m sorry, that' s not fun at all, especially since you two have been friends for so long. Have you tried reaching out to her by phone, email or social media?. EOS 4 0 3 She has cut our conversations short by saying she is tried. She will return text but I feel like I am always initiating. She likes watching tv show and told me with her NEW friend they Facetime and watch TV together. I really hate watching TV so don' t want to offer to participate. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, it' s a positive sign that she hasn' t blocked you completely. I agree, texting her each day could irritate her. That' s okay! You shouldn' t do anything that isn' t fun or enjoyable or comfortable for either of you, in my opinion. EOS 4 0 5 I am jealous that she is more successful in making new friends. I have not made a new friend in over 10 years. EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life. EOS 4 0 7 I don' t have many other friends and they are out of state. The one we are talking about lived an hour away but we would see each other 4 to 6 times a year, EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you' re saying you feel hurt and depressed at not being able to make new friends easily in the pandemic, correct? Ahhhh.,..... yes that; s difficult, oh boy.
0 0 0 Hello. My name is Spike. What is yours? Is anyone there? I feel kind of sad and rejected that no one is answering. Is this part of the task? EOS 0 1 1 [Others] oh no i' m sorry i left you waited. please tell me your problem.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Not so great - found out i' m losing my job in january. EOS 2 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] On no I am sorry to hear that! I know that must be tough. EOS 2 0 3 Yes I' m not even sure what steps to take right now. EOS 2 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea that can be difficult. Have you started looking for something else? EOS 2 0 5 Not yet, I' m not even sure where to begin. I have not looked for a job in 20 years. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way. EOS 2 0 7 I' ve tried calling the unemployment office to get some ideas but they do not answer their phones. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Or you could look for some side jobs like cleaning or organizing things until you find something more permanent. EOS 2 0 9 Yeah, i' m kinda old for that - LOL!!! My back would not hold up to that - and my salary wouldn' t be comparable. EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea it seems to be hard to get up with a lot of places at this time. Persistent is the key. EOS 2 0 11 Well I hear that their offices are closed and you have to do everything online - so not sure if they can even help me. EOS 2 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes i understand right now is a very bad time to find anything with so many places closed. Do you have any family or friends to reach out to for help if needed? EOS 2 0 13 I think I might be able to call my friend, but she' s in another state. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you gave any thought to babysitting or are there any crafts you are good at making that maybe you could try to sell? EOS 2 0 15 That would not be enough money. I would not be able to pay my bills. EOS 2 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand your concern there but it could help pay some as to help you not to get to far behind until you find something. EOS 2 0 17 that' s true but i don' t want to lose my house either. EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] If i were you i would call your friend maybe she has some suggestions of things you could do based off of your skills.
4 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 4 0 2 I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age? EOS 4 0 4 He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough, both for you and him. I know it' s meaningless to tell you not to be sad, however, you can think that he' s not in a better place. EOS 4 0 6 I presume you mean now and not not;). Though I simply am not a believer. It just made me think how meaningless life was.. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn' t it? I sometimes think it' s meaningless too. EOS 4 0 8 I do not really know what to do about my feelings. They are not going away. EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I feel you, coping with losing your loved ones is never easy. In fact, it' s confusing when you grieve and even when you recover and move on. EOS 4 0 10 Do you think that people ever really recover from a significant bereavement? I think that what you said there was very wise. Maybe it' s worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened.. there is guilt that comes with that. EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t think people can completely get over that, you just get used to the pain of not having them around. EOS 4 0 12 Whilst it hurts to think about him being dead, I think that it would hurt more if I had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I just need you to know that whatever your feeling is, it' s completely normal and you shouldn' t feel guilty for having it. EOS 4 0 14 It is just - very hard. I keep thinking about all the times I disagreed with him or did not appreciate him enough and I never got to tell him how much I loved him. EOS 4 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Your dad wouldn' t want to see you grieving everyday either. You should live the way you know he' d love to see. I believe he knew you loved him regardless how much you two argued. EOS 4 0 16 I know that he did:). I had just not expected to lose him at such a comparatively young age. He did not get to enjoy his retirement! EOS 4 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] That' s sad when he spent all his time taking care of the family and yet could not enjoy his free time. EOS 4 0 18 Yes. I think it would have been easier to deal with had he not immediately descended into very bad health as soon as he retired and had had time to have some fun. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you considered seeking therapist? We almost never think of that service, but in a lot of case, people actually need help from professionals when grieving. EOS 4 0 20 I can' t really afford to have therapy at the moment. Also I know that my dad was just have considered it to be a waste of money - he was very careful with money. EOS 4 1 21 [Others] he seemed to be a great man. Instead of regretting what happened, celebrate how great of a person he was. EOS 4 0 22 That is a really sensible suggestion and it cheers me up to think of it. You have been a really great help to me. EOS 4 1 23 [Greeting] I' m glad I could be some help for you.
2 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are we doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Okay how are you? EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Im doing great thanks. Anything on your mind today? EOS 2 0 3 Just pondering microcheating and wondering why someone who I do not like that way would be considered microcheating. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] And what do you mean by microcheating? EOS 2 0 5 It is a new thing like having a man you like that you check up on on social media even though you are in a relationship, or eating lunch with the same woman or man that you like but you don' t act on because you are married. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh i see, well i think overthinking things like that can lead to unwanted emotions. Or putting yourself in a situation with another person when you are in a relationship might mean there are other issues going on. EOS 2 0 7 Yes i see that. No nothing else going on just thinking that the definition maybe shouldn' t be as exact for the type of person that I do not talk to because of his reservations about it. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, if you are not talking to them then i see no harm. If you are talking to them with some sort of intention to for a relationship beyond friendship then i see issues arising. EOS 2 0 9 That is what I feel. I am not talking to him. I had to the other day to get in contact with someone( medical emergency) but do not call just to chat and catch up. I even unfriended him. I just want to comfort him over it but I think it is best just to never speak of him again. Comfort my fiance. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] To never speak to your fiance? If you want to continue your relationship and you do not feel you can continue a platonic relationship with this other person then that might be best. EOS 2 0 11 No I am ending my friendship with him. That is what is best. EOS 2 1 12 [Question] I think it might be as well if you cannot control it. I do have to ask though, are you happy with your Fiance? EOS 2 0 13 Yes very. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Then i 100% back you on your decision. Id take this time to focus on you too. Strengthen the bond a bit. EOS 2 0 15 Yes, I think that would be best. I thank you for your time. EOS 2 1 16 [Greeting] I thank you for opening up! EOS 2 0 17 It is okay see talking about this is actually microcheating. So now I am worried about that. EOS 2 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really wouldnt even consider it cheating to have feelings. Acting on them or trying to strengthen them may be though.
6 0 0 hi my friend. EOS 6 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] Hello! How are you doing? EOS 6 0 2 feeling very shame. EOS 6 1 3 [Question] Oh my god! What happened?

EOS 6 0 12 but till now my girlfriend dont know about it but her mom is now targeting me for her sexual desire. EOS 6 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You have got such a nice girlfriend, have a happy life with her. EOS 6 0 14 but think about her mom how could i handle her. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Dont worry, just tell your girlfriend directly about the incident of how her mom is behaving towards you with a proof if you could. Or else be bold enough to warn her mom regarding this. EOS 6 0 16 yes im going to warn her. EOS 6 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] You have such a nice girlfriend my dear friend, so cheating her is not at all fair. Yes, go ahead, the problems will vanish. EOS 6 0 18 yeah i can understand.

EOS 6 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Just be bold enough, dont get aroused or attracted to her by any way even though she' s seducing you, be harsh towards her, because you will have to teach a better lesson to her. Tell her, if she repeats this, then you are either gonna tell it to your girlfriend or either file a complaint against her. EOS 6 0 24 yyeah sure my friend i will try this. EOS 6 1 25 [Others] Yess. Go ahead.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you. EOS 3 0 1 Not doing well. I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Oh no, how long had you been together? EOS 3 0 3 we were together for 2 years. It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Wow, that' s horrible. How do you feel about it? EOS 3 0 5 I feel lost. I' m so used to her being around everyday. Now I don' t know what to do with myself without her. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year. EOS 3 0 7 Not only that, but with Covid going on I have noone i can see to talk about it. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have any family?
2 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you feeling today? EOS 2 0 1 Hi. I' m feeling okayish. EOS 2 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest. EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely. I recently broke up with my girlfriend. We had been together for more than 3 years. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] What happened that made you guys break up? EOS 2 0 5 She said that she simply wasn' t in love anymore, and that she didn' t have the same feelings she did at the beginning. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have also had this situation happen to me. Maybe it just wasn' t the right timing or she had other interests. EOS 2 0 7 She was so important for me. I feel so empty.... I Feel like I' m never finding anyone like her ever again, EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I' ve had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life. EOS 2 0 9 It' s easier said than done. At times I would rather maybe just dissapear. I have never had anyone else show romantic interest in me before. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] What is your age? EOS 2 0 11 I am 25 at the moment. EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] You still have your whole life ahead of you. Some people don' t find a partner until their 40' s or even 50' s. When I left my ex I found this guy that I truly fell in love with. He is still sulking in his living room. I told him that if he didn' t move one that he wouldnt get anywhere in life. I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what I would want him to do and I think thats what your girl would want you to do as well. EOS 2 0 13 I disagree with you regarding that maybe that is what she wants me to do. I don' t think she cares about me at the slightest anymore. I was a burden for her and will probably keep being it for any woman I meet. EOS 2 1 14 [Question] Did she give you any reasons to why she wasn' t in love anymore? EOS 2 0 15 I think she wasn' t feeling physically attracted to me anymore. EOS 2 1 16 [Question] Did you ever think she maybe possibly has been cheating? EOS 2 0 17 I could not say for sure. But I surely think she wouldn' t cheat on me. EOS 2 1 18 [Others] Has she ever tried to hide text messages, lock her phone, or tell you she is too busy to come over? EOS 2 0 19 Actually, In the past few months she has kinda freaked out everytime I tried to get her phone for her. As if she didn' t want me to see something. EOS 2 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Im sorry that this stressful for you. In my past, I have had exes do that to me. Most likely she was cheating on you and this was the reason for her motives. EOS 2 0 21 I can' t believe she would do something like that... I really need to confront her about it. I can' t have this doubt on my chest. EOS 2 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would definitely confront her about it. I wouldn' t get angry or fight about it. Maybe she if she has a new boyfriend already. That is a really good indicator.
6 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there! How may I support you? EOS 6 0 2 Well, I' m really upset with my friends. EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I am so sorry to hear that. Did something happen? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, they aren' t taking COVID seriously. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns? EOS 6 0 6 Yes but they get angry with me. I don' t know how to get through to them, EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It' s also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right. EOS 6 0 8 I really don' t know I just haven' t been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out. It' s a weird dynamic. EOS 6 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you' re finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it' s the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right? EOS 6 0 10 That' s exactly right. EOS 6 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is such a hard position to be in. it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance. EOS 6 0 12 I' d like to think so but I wish they would too. It' s hard to know what is right. EOS 6 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have found that having vitural movie nights, or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected. Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try?
0 0 0 Hi how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I' m doing fine, how are you?
4 0 0 I just lost my job and am worried about paying the bills. EOS 4 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills. EOS 4 0 2 There is just too much pressure, but I have to succeed. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is hard having so much pressure but I think you will be able to soon get employed again. EOS 4 0 4 I am trying. I' ve started looking online for new positions but it is a process. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise. EOS 4 0 6 I just still am continually nervous and having a hard time coping. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes deep breaths help people calm down. Have you tried that at all? EOS 4 0 8 I haven' t but maybe that will help me stay calmer. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That can sometimes help you to regain your focus and be able to do more for yourself. EOS 4 0 10 That makes sense. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Also, job counselors may help at employment agencies to match you with potential employers. Have you tried any?
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why? EOS 4 0 8 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID - 19 lockdowns. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] How long have you been working there? EOS 4 0 10 I am very sad about this country and my work situation. For 5 years. I work in accounting. EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID - 19 really has got us all down. EOS 4 0 12 What a great nation we live in..... a future 3rd world one. Yeah, but I was a good accountant. EOS 4 1 13 [Others] WOW, I' m sure that is a big change for you... EOS 4 0 14 Yeah, I have not told my wife about it just yet. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] I agree, this country has got some issues but we can get through them. Uh, oh, how do you think she will react? EOS 4 0 16 Yeah, I am not sure. I better wait to break the news in 2021. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there. EOS 4 0 18 And I am not the only one who is losing my job. Seems that all of accounting is going to be getting the axe. It makes me sad.... EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year. Do you have a resume? EOS 4 0 20 Plus, I have a 50 dollar a day spending habit on lottery tickets to one day hit it BIG. Yes, I have a resume that I have not updated just yet. I have a college education and a CPA to boot, but I need one lucky break in life. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes that will help to get a better perspective on things... taking some time away from everything in order to catch a breath. EOS 4 0 22 Maybe I can spend some quality time with my kids without them knowing I will be out of a job as of 01/ 15/ 2021. It is almost Christmas, too. EOS 4 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I hear ya, I feel like that quite a bit. Like if isn' t one thing it' s another. I' m sure your wife will understand how the economy has gotten and that she knows that it isn' t your fault. EOS 4 0 24 Maybe, but we have a huge mortgage and two BMW' s. We spend lavishly.... Plus, I spend 50 dollars a day on lotto. EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times, but remember all the good times you have had. Those would not be good times if it were' nt for tough times.

EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there. EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck. EOS 0 0 7 How did you push past that job? EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work. EOS 0 0 9 Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career? EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too. EOS 0 0 11 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Can you give me some more details? EOS 0 0 13 I just find the work mundane and way too remedial. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable. EOS 0 0 15 did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job? EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have you a few, there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit.
3 0 0 I am feeling depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about your feelings?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability. EOS 3 0 21 i applied for disability but didn' t get it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself. EOS 3 0 23 yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn' t matter. EOS 3 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Social Security stopped you. Why? EOS 3 0 25 i' m not injured enough for them. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can file against the company if you can prove neglect in the employer.. Were there proper safety guards. EOS 3 0 27 I tried but since it is the state of PA they have immunity. no. EOS 3 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was a state injury, there must be an avenue you can use to prove neglect. EOS 3 0 29 I was told that I assumed the risk of injury working for them. It was a mental hospital. EOS 3 1 30 [Question] have you contacted OSHA and filed a complaint with them? EOS 3 0 31 not yet. I should. EOS 3 1 32 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There should be an avenue for you to seek compensation. EOS 3 0 33 The lawyer fought with them for over a year. There was even an appeal but I lost that too. EOS 3 1 34 [Reflection of feelings] It is unfortunate that safety is not a factor. It was a state hospital? EOS 3 0 35 yes. EOS 3 1 36 [Question] Did a patient attack you? EOS 3 0 37 yes. EOS 3 1 38 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There must be liability concerning your injury. EOS 3 0 39 I can' t go after the patient because they are mentally incompetent so I' m out of ideas. EOS 3 1 40 [Question] But what about the family? EOS 3 0 41 I don' t know if the person had one anymore. EOS 3 1 42 [Question] Is the patient a ward of the state. EOS 3 0 43 yes. EOS 3 1 44 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So the patient' s family either gave the person up or the patient was placed there by the state right? EOS 3 0 45 he was placed there by the court after committing a crime. EOS 3 1 46 [Affirmation and Reassurance] . Then he must be a threat to other people. It seems the state should be held liable for negligence. EOS 3 0 47 Oh I agree. There were many dangerous patients there and no recourse for the staff. I was injured 5 times in the years I worked there. This last one was the end for me. I couldn' t work anymore due to pain. EOS 3 1 48 [Question] Can you work from home for yourself?
0 0 0 Hello? Is anyone there? Is anyone there. HELLO? no one is supporting me here..:: twiddles thumbs:: the instructions for the support seeker are incorrect as there is no button that has shown for" the partner' s reasons".. the supporter did not respond. This test is skewed. No one is here to chat with. even after being matched. Ridiculous. hello????? hello? no other messages except my own are showing up. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Sorry, I had a bad connection. Hello, what can I help you with? EOS 0 0 2 Hi. i wasn' t sure anyone was there. i left my job about three months after 8 years.. haven' t found another one.. trying to find one has been challenging. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Just be clear, you' re worried about finding a new job? EOS 0 0 4 well, yeah. in the middle of a pandemic, and being in a new town. all of that has been really hard. and stressful. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a difficult position to be in. It is a hard time, but there' s always a way to persevere. EOS 0 0 6 yeah... i don' t know... i' m not sleeping well because i' m so worried. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I could imagine that being a constant worry. I understand how you may feel. EOS 0 0 8 thanks for trying to understand. it just seems pretty hopeless. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] No problem. I am encountering a similar situation, looking for a well suited job. Have you tried looking in to new career fields that have always interested you? EOS 0 0 10 Yeah, I am looking in a variety of fields. not much out there that is remote. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are a lot of jobs in technology where the only requirement is learning a few courses, such as programming. EOS 0 0 12 that would be cool. i really enjoy tech. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It would be nice to work in a field that you also enjoy! EOS 0 0 14 yes it would.. just don' t have much energy to keep turning in cover letters and resumes.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It can seem hopeless right now, but think about how you felt when you were in a better position. EOS 0 0 16 yah thats true. you have any ideas on how to be less anxious. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] That helps me balance things out in my head sometimes. Sometimes we get stuck. It happens.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 im feeling pretty sad today. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 4 0 3 its about me and my friend got fight for misunderstanding. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like your feelings are hurt over a misunderstanding you had with a friend is this correct? EOS 4 0 5 yeah thats correct. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] I see i am sorry that it has you feeling down, did you try to talk with your friend to see if you could resolve your feelings? EOS 4 0 7 no he was not responding to me. he just avoiding me. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe you could send him a message on social media and let him know the argument has your feelings hurt and you would like to try to talk about it when he has time. EOS 4 0 9 thanks but he totally avoiding me he just blocked me and he ignore me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] how long have you been friends with him? EOS 4 0 11 for 5 years. but he thinks that i have affair with his girlfriend. EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] oh yea that can make things difficult, but i think if you keep reaching out you may could talk this over. Did you try to explain to him that his thoughts were not true? EOS 4 0 13 yeah but how should i start because he misjudged me and his girlfriend its a sensitive issue. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would start off by telling him that you were sorry that he had those thoughts but there is no truth to it and the fact that he does not trust you enough to know that is hurtful to you and her. If that does not work then you might need to take some time to reflect and figure out if that is a friendship worth trying to save, you may find yourself better off without a friend who shows no trust in you. EOS 4 0 15 please give me some suggegtion that what should i do now. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would continue trying to reach out to him and until you can get in touch with him maybe find some thing to do to occupy your mind as to where it does not bother you so much. do you have any hobbies? EOS 4 0 17 yeah i like to play football. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe go play some football to get your mind off of it. EOS 4 0 19 yeah sure. EOS 4 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] from chatting with you seem like a nice person, try not to let it get you down. EOS 4 0 21 now im feeling well because of you. EOS 4 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] i am glad i could be of some help! EOS 4 0 23 thanks my friend. EOS 4 1 24 [Greeting] you are welcome.
3 0 0 I' m so depressed, I just got layed off. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I am sorry to hear that, did you apply for unemployment benefit? That at least can help you financially until you get a new job. EOS 3 0 2 Yes, it will take weeks and the holidays are just around the corner. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sucks it happens so close to the holidays. I understand it' s hard to accept but I' d recommend talking with someone close to you like a friend and family member. EOS 3 0 4 I know, with all the other crap going on now everyone else has their own problems they don' t want to hear mine. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure someone will be there for you, they know you need them the most right now. If you don' t feel comfortable talking to them, you can seek online therapist. There are a lot of free service for mental car. EOS 3 0 6 They' re busy with other people' s problems. I' ll deal with it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It' s not gonna be easy, but at the same time not impossible. Try looking at it a different way. You can use this time to train your skills or do things that you' ve wanted to but didn' t have the time. EOS 3 0 8 I wanted to travel but that' s not a good idea right now. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] You can still travel domestically or just around your city. I like taking a walk in the park or wandering downtown to clear my mind. EOS 3 0 10 I live in a small town and were are suppose to self quarantine unless we have to leave the house for work or go to the store. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] that really sucks. Do you have a garden at home? In the mean time, try following youtube or other channels to work out, it helps you distract from current issue and also makes you healthier. A healthy body is needed for a healthy mind. EOS 3 0 12 I did, everything is gone now.. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] what have you been doing lately? EOS 3 0 14 I do like to cook. I' ll probable do more of that now. EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s a great idea, cooking and doing crafts can be helpful for you. Instead of complaining with others, you can just invite them to join cooking with you, that way you can have companion. EOS 3 0 16 That is a good idea but nobody is suppose to go to other peoples houses. EOS 3 1 17 [Self-disclosure] you can do video chat while cooking. I do virtual happy hour with my friends right now too. EOS 3 0 18 I think I may start making my own beer. Two birds one stone. EOS 3 1 19 [Others] haha good idea. EOS 3 0 20 Thanks for the help have a good evening. EOS 3 1 21 [Greeting] you too, i hope things get better for yourself.
3 0 0 hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 i am ok so far. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 4 i am depressed. and need some inspiration. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression? EOS 3 0 6 Covid - 19. and money issues. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, this has really been a hard time for all of us. How has it impacted you personally? EOS 3 0 8 my mom and sister had caught the virus they are doing ok now but it was rough. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how hard that must have been. I' m glad they are doing ok now though! EOS 3 0 10 yeah me too. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] How have you been using your time during the crisis? EOS 3 0 12 yeah mostly working and meditation. EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] That' s great! Meditation is also something I' ve picked up during this time. It' s really helpful and can keep you balanced. Do you have a routine or do you just do it sporadically? EOS 3 0 14 i mostly do it sporadically but i do need to do it more often. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It' s great to try to integrate it into your day. All of us tend to have at least a few moments each day to ourselves. Even if it' s during a shower or bathroom break, you really can meditate anywhere! It' s all about being in the here and now. EOS 3 0 16 so true. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] When things get stressful, meditation can be difficult. Sometimes we get wrapped up so much in our emotions that trying to center yourself and focus on your breathing and the moment can be hard. One thing I' ve learned to be helpful when I' m stressed is to breathe in through my nose while internally counting to three and out through my mouth counting to three. The counting tends to distract my mind from whatever stressful thing I was thinking of before.
3 0 0 Hi. I am Mike. Live in central Kansas and have been very depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that, is there a particular reason or instance for you feeling this way? EOS 3 0 2 I lost my job due to Covid and they have shut down for good. no jobs around here and no vehicle so i feel hopeless and hate my living situation. just before covid hit i was saving to move... but then job closed. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes that is a very tough situation, Covid has real placed a large amount of stress through out the world. There may be a ray of hope however with a possible vaccine in the near future, maybe this will be back to normal soon and new jobs will become available. EOS 3 0 4 I hope so and that is what i know mentally. but emotionally it is hard. i just hate having no job, being at home, no money, no vehicle, and a very bad idea to date since there is a high contagious pandemic. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand and you are right it is a a lot of mental stress. Have you reached out to claim unemployment or go to a food pantry? During this pandemic you should not feel shameful to take advantage of these services, there are alot of people who have to ask for help for the first time in their lives. EOS 3 0 6 I did not make enough to get unemployment they said. I have not tried a food pantry but that is a great idea. what makes this difficult is I am in a very small town. like we dont wal marts or McDonalds or anything like that. Whole town closes at 9. the closest actual city is 45 miles away. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well please try the food pantry and see what they have to offer. Is there anyone whom you could ask for a ride in the future when they go to the bigger city?
3 1 0 [Question] hi how' s it going today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you? EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future? EOS 3 0 5 Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it' s true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online?
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 0 0 2 Just feeling sad. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad? EOS 0 0 4 Not being able to leave the house with Covid. plus my hours were cut at work. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut. What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time? EOS 0 0 6 Yes it sucks. I live alone now so there really hard sometimes. I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos. Nothing productive. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it' s not the same as face to face. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I have one close friend that I talk to every now and then. Its not like it use to be. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That' s still a win. EOS 0 0 10 We used to be able to go out and have a few beers together.. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. Keep that connection. It' s not going to be the same due to the circumstances. But at least you are seeking to keep that connection, and that is a good thing. EOS 0 0 12 I hope that this vaccine thing is reason and we can get back to the norm.. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it' s not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest. EOS 0 0 14 Good idea.. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well. But I am hoping they get it right, and not just rush to get something out there that may or may not work. EOS 0 0 16 I like to do home repairs. Maybe I can find a group for that. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway. EOS 0 0 18 Do you use any other social media for connecting with new people. EOS 0 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I use Facebook, Instagram, and sometimes TikTok. You should do mini videos on easy things to DIY on TikTok. EOS 0 0 20 True. I have to change out a few old style electrical plugs. Maybe I can do something on that? EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] right! That is a great idea! EOS 0 0 22 I saw a few TikTok videos but never post a video. Is it hard to post on there? EOS 0 1 23 [Self-disclosure] not really. what i do is record the video beforehand, and then upload it. EOS 0 0 24 Oh. Okay. EOS 0 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] But you can also record it straight to the app. You can also do the same on SnapChat. EOS 0 0 26 I noticed all the videos are so short. I think I will have to use YouTube for a longer video? I never used SnapChat. Is that the one disappears after some time.? EOS 0 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, if you are doing longer videos, I recommend YouTube. What you can do, is do a short clip on TikToc and then in that clip instruct viewers to follow your YouTube Channel. Yes Snap Chat dissappears after it' s viewed.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, I' m pretty much down. trying to keep my head afloat. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] im sorry to hear that. Would you care to talk about what is bothering you?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 Hi, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Greeting] Doing good.. How are you? EOS 0 0 3 I' m feeling really anxious these days. I' m finding the COVID online learning experience to be too much for me at this time. I want to stop school, but I don' t think I can afford to. I need to get done with school. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand your frustration. All of us are challenged due to COVID. EOS 0 0 5 School was always hard. Now it' s gotten harder. I think a lot of people are stressed.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] How long are you doing the online school? EOS 0 0 7 Last semester and this semester. It feels like a lot longer though. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What are you missing most? Friends? EOS 0 0 9 A balance in life. I spend so much time online. I' m always staring at a screen. I would like to get aware from the computer. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] As the vaccination started, I believe we will be back to normal soon.. EOS 0 0 11 Yeah, I can' t wait for things to return to normal. Until then, I don' t know what I can do to feel normal. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I saw some of my friends hang out in zoom... having virtual drinks.. have you tried that? EOS 0 0 13 No, I haven' t. I thought it wouldn' t be the same as really hanging out. I don' t drink. I do like to play board games though. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It will not be same.. but better than being alone..
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? EOS 1 0 22 He' s a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly. EOS 1 0 24 But maybe I deserved it. EOS 1 1 25 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly. EOS 1 0 26 Yes, he did. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No you did not! Please don' t think like that. EOS 1 0 28 I' m just so angry that I could break something. And maybe I will do that! EOS 1 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this. EOS 1 0 30 But what if it doesn' t pass? And I cannot afford therapy. EOS 1 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now. There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free. EOS 1 0 32 I don' t know if I could do that. I don' t like talking about my problems with strangers. EOS 1 1 33 [Self-disclosure] And yet here we are: P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found.. I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that I was. EOS 1 0 34 Do you have any suggestions about how to open up to people I don' t know? EOS 1 1 35 [Others] I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No - one will be judging you. EOS 1 0 36 That' s what I am afraid of. Being judged by people. EOS 1 1 37 [Question] Do you think that this might partly because your ex has eroded your self esteem?. EOS 1 0 38 Probably. He called me a lot of names. EOS 1 1 39 [Others] The important thing is to gradually rebuild your self esteem. Do you have any things that you excel at?. EOS 1 0 40 I' m good at bowling. And I like riding horses. EOS 1 1 41 [Others] Animals are a wonderful source of comfort when we are feeling very low! Could you join a riding club to make some new friends? EOS 1 0 42 Maybe I will do that. Horses are so cool. EOS 1 1 43 [Reflection of feelings] I can feel that you are starting to make progress already and are thinking of things that you can do post break up. EOS 1 0 44 I sure am. Thanks for your help. EOS 1 1 45 [Greeting] You are most welcome. Is there anything else you would like to talk to me about?
4 1 0 [Question] how are yo. EOS 4 0 1 Good how are you. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] ok. thanks for asking. what on your mind. EOS 4 0 3 Just been having a rough time.... recently broke up with my girlfriend. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] sounds hard. are you doing anything to help. EOS 4 0 5 Trying to avoid thoughts about her, but every where on social media she is posting about her new guy. It is hard to escape the sadness. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow. in our connected world it is hard to get away. do you want to tell me how it happened.
1 0 0 I' m qualified for a promotion but my boss is refusing to promote me based on biased feedback he has received from someone else. EOS 1 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn' t willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right? EOS 1 0 2 Yes that' s right. It' s frustratgn.* frustrating. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co - worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective. EOS 1 0 4 Unfortunately I can' t really talk to anyone at work because there is no one I trust to this extent. Promotions are a bit of a sensitive issue. EOS 1 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you reported to your HR department the issue around biased feedback being used as a determining factor in not being considered? EOS 1 0 6 The HR department favours managers so I am worried that will damage my chances of promotion further. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry you have to deal with this at work. I think you deserve the promotion because you are very dedicated. EOS 1 0 8 Thanks, that' s good to hear. EOS 1 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think if you continue to advocate for yourself in a positive manner you could possibly increase the chances of being considered for the promotion. EOS 1 0 10 It' s hard to be positive when I feel like my manager is not receptive to my opinions and just trusts the feedback given by this one other person. EOS 1 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' ve worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment. My co - workers were not supportive and I was always overlooked. Eventually, I realized that the environment was toxic and chose to start applying for different jobs. I felt like if my potential couldn' t be appreciated then I should go somewhere with opportunities for growth. EOS 1 0 12 Maybe it is time for me to start looking elsewhere for better opportunities. I' ve worked at this place so long that I have become comfortable here and the thought of searching for a new job is intimidating. EOS 1 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You' ve got this! It' s easy to become comfortable in what we know but, change causes us to grow. EOS 1 0 14 Yeah I agree, it' s uncomfortable and difficult though! I haven' t searched for a new job in so long, I feel like I will perform terribly at the interviews. EOS 1 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Just start slowly and remember that you can be picky about what position you chose. I also think we all feel like we perform badly during interviews. Preparation is key. I hope discussing your work situation today has made you feel a bit better! EOS 1 0 16 It has, thanks for being supportive and listening to my problem. EOS 1 1 17 [Greeting] It was my pleasure! Thank you for sharing with me. I' m glad I had the opportunity.
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 1 0 1 I could be better. How about U? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] I am doing well. Whats bothering you? EOS 1 0 3 A friend screwed me out of money and a business venture. I am no longer friends with her. We were really close before this.. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! I am so sorry that has happened to you. That must feel like such a betrayal. Can you tell me more about it? EOS 1 0 5 It does. I' ve known her for 14 years and we dated. I invested a lot of money in a business she wanted to do. She took the money and ran. EOS 1 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back. EOS 1 0 7 What do you suggest? EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Did you sign anything? or have proof of what happened? EOS 1 0 9 No. Other than the money I transferred to her. Hello? EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What was the business? It depends on your location but I' m sure just on the transaction alone that shows some kind of intent. or text messages saying it was for a specific purpose? EOS 1 0 11 A cat cafe. Where you can hang out and work or drink with adoptable cats from the local shelter.. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you gave her a large amount of money and have any kind of messages about it I would look into trying to get it back. EOS 1 0 13 I gave her 80K. No messages. It was all done in person. Do you think I should get a lawyer and call the cops? EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would seek the advice of a lawyer. I' m sorry this has happened thats horrible. EOS 1 0 15 It is. I don' t want to go to the police. I think they are all corrupt and raciest. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would say 80K is worth speaking to a lawyer about it. I' m sorry you are so conflicted. I would not call the police because you willingly gave it to her. I would hire a lawyer to handle it.
0 1 0 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] hi. EOS 0 0 1 Online learning is not seems easy, Seems I am going to fail this year. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] chill my dear friend, nothing of that sort will happen.

EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there. EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck. EOS 0 0 7 How did you push past that job? EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work. EOS 0 0 9 Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career? EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too. EOS 0 0 11 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Can you give me some more details? EOS 0 0 13 I just find the work mundane and way too remedial. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable. EOS 0 0 15 did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job? EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have you a few, there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit. EOS 0 0 17 what types of skill can I gain online? EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Indeed is one of the better ones to look for jobs, honestly I would suggest looking at jobs that you normally wouldn' t and see what kind of qualifications they need and see if you can get that done online. EOS 0 0 19 so filter based on my absolute needs and go for online skills that I can complete? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes I think that is a great idea, look for jobs that meet your needs and figure out what you can do to look attractive to employers. EOS 0 0 21 I have tried glassdoor before, have you had any luck there? EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used it a bit, I mainly used indeed. EOS 0 0 23 and have you showcased your skills using LinkedIn before? I have had that one recommended to me before, they said its a great way to neatly organize accomplishments and personal background. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes especially if you are applying for anything in a professional setting that is very important. EOS 0 0 25 do you have any examples of online skills you completed? EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] coursera has a lot of great courses, it really depends on what you are looking for.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! How are you doing? EOS 0 0 1 im ok kinda stressed. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Anything I can help with:)? Feeling stressed is never fun:( What has been making you feel stressed? EOS 0 0 3 im feeling very overwhelmed and cant get anything done cause i dont know where to start! i want to declutter my house but dont know where to start. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I hear you, feeling overwhelmed and like you don' t know where to start can leave a person feeling stressd forsure! Decluttering sounds like a great idea! Sometimes taking baby steps is a good place to start! EOS 0 0 5 but there are so many thinggs to do and ideas i have. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Of course! It can feel so stressful when we have all these little things we want to do but don' t know where to start! EOS 0 0 7 should i start in one room or one group of things and collect them from all the rooms? EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What is one little area that maybe seems easier to start with? Yeah, that' s a great idea! EOS 0 0 9 well i seem to start and them i end up jumoing to another thing! jumping. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, well that' s okay! starting is half the battle, so that' s an accomplishment right there! EOS 0 0 11 thanx that helps cause i start feeling defeated. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried maybe using a timer or making a list to help keep you focused on decluttering one area at a time? Of course! It' s easy to be hard on ourselves, but just the fact that you are trying is so important! EOS 0 0 13 u know what i bought a timer and it came in today! hopefully it will help! EOS 0 1 14 [Others] Oh awesome! I am so glad! Maybe trying that out could be useful!
0 0 0 I am very worried about losing my job. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello - How are you today? EOS 0 0 2 Anxious. I think my boss wants to fire me. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so sorry you are worried about losing your job. I have been in your shoes before. Why do you think your boss wants to fire you? EOS 0 0 4 Thank you. I think if I am late again, I will be let go.. I have a sick child and my boss does not understand. How can I explain that I may be late to the office, but that I am a valuable employee? EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Have you explained to him your reasoning? I also once had to take care of my sick grandmother after work and had a tough time explaining it to my boss. Have you offered to stay later to make up the work? EOS 0 0 6 No. But that is a good idea. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe your boss can compromise with you. It' s worth a shot! EOS 0 0 8 It' s a very competitive office and I don' t want to look weak. EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] You sound like you care about this job and that is a valuable asset in a an employee. EOS 0 0 10 I do. I hope I can explain the situation clearly and offer to make up time by staying late. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand. Is there a coworker or mentor that maybe you can talk to?
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am very sorry to hear that. What are you sad about?
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. EOS 3 0 16 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. EOS 3 0 18 That is a good point.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. EOS 3 0 20 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand. EOS 3 0 22 I should trust my partner more than any random person. EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters. EOS 3 0 24 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? EOS 3 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you.... even after work. EOS 3 0 26 okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.

EOS 6 1 7 [Question] have you put in job applications everywhere. EOS 6 0 8 Yes I did, and quite a lot but I think because of the pandemic they are not hiring that much. EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] With this pandemic going on i know it is even more harder to get a job. EOS 6 0 10 yes. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you are right. Have you looked on the internet such as indeed? EOS 6 0 12 I' ve tried LinkedIn they have many companies hiring. maybe my CV is just bad. EOS 6 1 13 [Question] yes they do i am familiar with that. how is your resume looking? EOS 6 0 14 I think I could improve it. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you talked to someone in your family and see if they could help you with your resume to improve it. EOS 6 0 16 I' ve asked some friends, I think a friend will help me out when he' s not busy. EOS 6 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient. EOS 6 0 18 Yes I know. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried to go to place and talk to a hiring boss about a job? EOS 6 0 20 It' s hard with this virus to go anywhere pretty much. EOS 6 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] yes i can understand that. EOS 6 0 22 Worst time to graduate. Haven' t even got the graduation ceremony lol. EOS 6 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] all you can honestly really do right now is to try to improve your resume and see if that helps any and just keep searching for jobs and putting in applications and i know you will get a call from a job soon. yes it has been a bad year for anything to happen. EOS 6 0 24 Yea that' s what I am thinking of doing. EOS 6 1 25 [Others] good thing is you graduated and congrats on that.
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today.
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 3 0 2 Not feeling good. Trying to find a job but no success. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] It' s a really hard time to be finding new work isn' t it? Are you getting unemployment or anything? EOS 3 0 4 I am getting unemployment but that is not sufficient with 6 children. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wow that' s a lot of kids. Do you know that there are foodbanks out there which might be able to help you? EOS 3 0 6 As a single mother It' s pretty hard to go to search for food bank. I am spending most of my time in looking for a job. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are there any organisations that you could just call and explain your predicament to? EOS 3 0 8 I don' t know any as I never faced such situation before and my partner was there to support the family. Now there is no support of him. life is becoming misearable. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Do you have friends who could help you, even with child care? EOS 3 0 10 One of my friends was really helpful. She moved to different city last month. After that I am totally shattered. EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine that that must have been traumatic. You will make new friends though. EOS 3 0 12 Life is becoming hard day by day. I am feeling guilty that I can' t feed my kids well. No one wants to do friendship with poor people. EOS 3 1 13 [Greeting] I am a poor person too and I' d be happy to be your friend. We have to stick together!
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad.
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing. EOS 6 0 8 Yeah, people don' t know that just because my two friends go" Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two( so - called) friends? EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] definatly not... have you tried explaining your situation to them? EOS 6 0 10 No, they don' t know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID - 19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time? EOS 6 0 12 I might be able to do that. EOS 6 1 13 [Others] unfortunatly it is right now very comen this situation, so no shame for that, EOS 6 0 14 Well, I used to donate a LOT in year' s past. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] a lot of times donating time to help organisatiosn is more valuable then money. EOS 6 0 16 Great point. EOS 6 1 17 [Others] times and situations change so thats ok. EOS 6 0 18 My friends may like to know that I am trading time.... instead of donating money. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i worked for a non profit and the biggest struggle was to find volunteers to help out.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, I' m pretty much down. trying to keep my head afloat. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] im sorry to hear that. Would you care to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 3 0 3 I lost my job some months back and it hasn' t really been easy for me. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, loss of income can be very stressful. Have you been looking for work since then? EOS 3 0 5 Sometimes when I enter a place where my friends are, they tend to go silent when I enter the room. Yes. Its been months now and nothing yet. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Why do you think it is that they go silent? EOS 3 0 7 I' m pretty sure they were talking about me. 2 of myy friends have been helping me with rent money. and I' m pretty sure they must be fed up. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried picking up odd jobs maybe cleaning for someone or helping them move or organize there things? EOS 3 0 9 Yes I have. That' s what helps with feeding and getting some little things at home. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Have you asked them if this is causing problems? EOS 3 0 11 and sometimes I pay back little of what they loan me since I know I cant pay all of it. EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could offer to do some things for them in return for the money so its not like they are just giving it to you. EOS 3 0 13 I' ve playfully asked why did they all go silent when I walked in, but they try changing the topic to something else. I babysit sometimes. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would let them know that i notice it happening and it is starting to concern you and if it is the problem you would gladly do some things for them to earn it rather them just giving it to you to help out. EOS 3 0 15 It' s not as easy as you say it. I feel I' m no longer needed. like an outcast. EOS 3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure if it was a major problem when you brought it up one of them would have spoke up, I would try not to worry to much over that and focus more on finding a job.
4 1 0 [Question] how are yo. EOS 4 0 1 Good how are you. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] ok. thanks for asking. what on your mind. EOS 4 0 3 Just been having a rough time.... recently broke up with my girlfriend. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] sounds hard. are you doing anything to help. EOS 4 0 5 Trying to avoid thoughts about her, but every where on social media she is posting about her new guy. It is hard to escape the sadness. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow. in our connected world it is hard to get away. do you want to tell me how it happened. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah it is. Well we have been having trouble staying closely connected since the lockdown. We tried to make time for one another, but it has been tough. I was the one who broke things off because I know longer felt much love coming from her. I felt neglected and I thought a break up was the best solution. I did not think she would pick up a new guy two weeks later. I was not prepared to deal with this kind of pain and it hurts. EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It was wise of you to know your feeling towards the relationship and make a mature decision for the both of you. During this pandemic too. that must have been even harder.. EOS 4 0 9 Yeah it has been difficult and I know I will make it through. It is just difficult to get through break ups these days. Unless you disconnect you can' t avoid the other person. EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] that' s a good idea. Have you thought about disconnecting? EOS 4 0 11 Yeah I was thinking of maybe organizing a hunting/ fishing/ camping trip with my buddies over winter break. That could help get me out of the digital world and would help me spend quality time with my friends. EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] nothing better than the outdoors wit h some friends. Fresh air can really clear the mind. EOS 4 0 13 Yeah I think that is probably what I will end up doing. It will probably help the mental health of the entire friend group, but especially me right now. EOS 4 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] perspective is found from looking at things from a distance. you maybe to close to everything right now to see the forest from the trees. EOS 4 0 15 Thank you for the help and the advice. I think I will follow through and make the trip happen. Any tips on eventually getting back out in the dating game in these strange times? EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Again, I think you were the mature one that ended the relationship. It is hard to see her" move on", but you will do the same. covid has changed the environments to meet people though, and all I can suggest is to be patient. The world will get back to normal. and you will too..
0 0 0 Hi. Hello, can you help me? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I hope so. What kind of problem are you having? EOS 0 0 2 I am really struggling with my studies at the moment, I am so anxious that I keep putting off my essays and worrying all the time. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are a student who is having trouble. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, I am a mature student and struggling with my course. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand how you feel. I was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school. It is very understandable that you are feeling stressed, especially with the pandemic and other issues happening. EOS 0 0 6 yes, the pandemic is making it worse. I am working as well so I am struggling juggling them all and running a house. I just don' t know how to get back on track with my studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about putting together a schedule to help you manage your time? EOS 0 0 8 How would I go about that? EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you go online, there are different templates for students. One would be a time management template where you fill in the blocks of different times of the day. Also, do you know any of your classmates that you could email or text for support? EOS 0 0 10 okay, I can see the sense in that. Have you used them before, if so would you recommend putting everything on there or keeping it flexible? I do have a couple that i could contact, I' ve been feeling really embarrassed to contact them, like they might think I am being silly. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] To start, fill in one week to see what all activities you have to do. Set aside specific time for doing your schoolwork. Try and stick with the schedule. EOS 0 0 12 Okay, one week doesn' t seem too scary. I could colour coordinate it, I like things in colour. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] . I would try it. EOS 0 0 14 Ok, do you think I should reach out to my classmates, will they think i' m being silly, I really don' t want to alienate them. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe there is a discussion board where you could be anonymous. Break your writing down in small chunks. Just brainstorm one day, for example. EOS 0 0 16 I don' t think so, however, I might just start with the template and see if that helps first. I like the idea of breaking things into the chunks. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try one thing at a time so you are not overwhelmed. EOS 0 0 18 Thank you, I feel a little better, maybe I just needed some control. Yes, that' s good, one thing at once. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I agree. You are not alone.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 I' m good. How about you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Very little to complain about today. What brings you here? EOS 3 0 3 Just want to talk some random stuff basically just want a companion. EOS 3 1 4 [Others] How' s the weather where you are? EOS 3 0 5 Still pretty cold and dry in here, how about there? EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Exactly the same. What are you doing to stay warm? EOS 3 0 7 Just in my long pajamas with heater. I don' t really know what to do anymore, I am just lazy on everything. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well you' re resourceful at staying warm, at least. You mentioned wanting a companion, are you living alone?
6 0 0 I am having a really hard time with something that I did to my boyfriend. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Do you want to talk about it? EOS 6 0 2 Yes, thank you! I was with him since childhood and we are actually still together. I slipped up one night and hate to admit what I did. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you' re holding onto a lot of guilt about this incident. Are you comfortable talking about that night?
0 0 0 Hi how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I' m doing fine, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 Doing ok, thanks. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] thats good what do you have planned for the holidays? EOS 0 0 4 Not a whole lot due to the economic hardship my family and I are facing. How about you?. as far as holiday plans. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I completely understand that i feel that pain as well. are you there? EOS 0 0 6 oh I am sorry to hear that. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s ok there are plenty of other things that you can do with family during this time. EOS 0 0 8 Thats true that should be the holiday spirit and keep hope alive. EOS 0 1 9 [Question] exactly so what else do you have planned are you ready for the new year? EOS 0 0 10 Cook a good meal and spend time with my kids and spouse. Gifts wont be extravagant this year but I guess its the thought that counts. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes it' s the thought that counts and being blessed to be around love ones.
4 0 0 Hi I am so sad my boyfriend was cheating and broke up with me when I found out. I don' t think I can ever be happy again. EOS 4 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self - esteem is that true? EOS 4 0 2 I have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. I have lost interest in everything I can barely make myself go to work. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better? EOS 4 0 4 Maybe, why would he cheat? I have seen her she is not that pretty. I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination. EOS 4 1 5 [Others] remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren' t right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else. EOS 4 0 6 I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn' t want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn' t mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that. EOS 4 0 8 I trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. I thought we were so perfect together, I don' t want him back I could never trust him again, I am not sure I could trust any guy right now, I am so hurt and confused. I don' t ever want to feel like this again. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] relationship issues, especially when they and suddenly can be one of the most stressful periods in an adults life. you are not alone in that other people have been through similar experiences themselves. EOS 4 0 10 This was the first guy I ever lived with, I thought we would get married one day. How do people make it through the pain, it actually hurts. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?. EOS 4 0 12 I have a couple acquaintances at work but I wouldn' t want to discuss my personal life with, my mom said to have a good cry but I almost couldn' t stop once I started. He was my best friend and who I talked to once we got together I didn' t seem to need anyone else which looks like a mistake now. That is why I am here for support. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ok I understand. It is normal to be upset in a situation like this. When I ask if there is someone to talk to, I meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup. There are also support groups out there that can really help. Getting your emotions out and seeing that others struggle with the same issue may be a very good thing.
4 0 0 i cant go back to uni due to finacial issue. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Good afternoon. How may I assist you? EOS 4 0 2 good afternnon. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] What is unit? Are talking school. EOS 4 0 4 as i stated i had to cut university short and i feel like am going to finish old. EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What age are You? EOS 4 0 6 and i feel like school is my best chance to be someone and get out of the life we are in. mid twenties. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand your dilemma. I am in my 60s and desiring my degree as well. EOS 4 0 8 oh do you feel like you under achieved like you do better. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The COVID has put a lot of students is a bind. EOS 4 0 10 maybe but this is not the first time prosponding. EOS 4 1 11 [Others] No I want to study a certain field. For better understanding of the Bible. EOS 4 0 12 oh that sounds great. sometimes i feel like God is my only ally and friend. EOS 4 1 13 [Question] have you ever heard the phrase you are never to old to learn? EOS 4 0 14 Yes i have. EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Yes He truly stands by you.
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you feeling? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay. Thank you. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i' m okay too. EOS 0 0 4 Thats good. Do you have plans for the holidays? EOS 0 1 5 [Others] not really, i will probably just relax. what about you? EOS 0 0 6 Just hanging out at home with my husband and son. EOS 0 1 7 [Others] how' s your relationship with your family? EOS 0 0 8 It is pretty good. We all get along good. No issues. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] glad to hear so! EOS 0 0 10 How is your relationship with your family? EOS 0 1 11 [Others] it' s overly alright but i don' t really get along with my father. EOS 0 0 12 Oh i am sorry to hear that.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] don' t worry, it' s okay i am used to it. EOS 0 0 14 Has the Pandemic affected your work life at all?. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] not really i' ve always worked from home. what about you? EOS 0 0 16 Not me so much. Business was slow for quite a while because nobody was really working. But it affected my husband, because everytime anyone in our house got sick he had to leave work becase his work didnt allow anybody to be there if anybody in there household was sick.. So he missed quite a bit of work. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that must have been really terrible, i hope you all are coping with that. how did that make you feel? EOS 0 0 18 It was nerve wracking because you never knew how long he was going to be out of work for. his work changed their policy about when he could come back everytime he was out. EOS 0 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] just from talking to you i can see that it was very stressing for you. is he back to work yet? EOS 0 0 20 oh yes it defintely was. he is out again because I just tested positive for COVID. So he will be out of work for two weeks. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] is there any possibility of him getting a vaccine? he seems to be testing positive fairly often. EOS 0 0 22 He has never tested positive. I tested positive. Just anytime you get any kind of sickness his work makes you take time off just in case you have COVID. He has been tested 3 different times and it has always been negative. EOS 0 1 23 [Others] oh sorry for misunderstanding you. EOS 0 0 24 Thats okay. EOS 0 1 25 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] correct me if i' m wrong but sickness causes you nervousness?
3 0 0 I was reallly worried in this suitation. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi, i' m sean, hows your day going.
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 2 I have been better. I had a rough semester in school.. EOS 6 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So things haven' t been going well at school. I think a lot of people are going through these days. EOS 6 0 4 It was alright at first but I failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade. EOS 6 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m sorry to hear that. That' s a heck of a situation to be in. Is there anything you can do? Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock? EOS 6 0 6 Yes, I already tried to appeal my grade. EOS 6 1 7 [Question] And the teacher wouldn' t budge? EOS 6 0 8 Sadly, no. I think they were too busy to really take a long time to discuss it or work with me. EOS 6 1 9 [Question] Was this for a course that was required for a major? EOS 6 0 10 It was a core class and I needed it to graduate. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ok, if you' re willing to give it one more shot, try to appeal the grade one more time. If that doesn' t work, you could try talking the class again next semester or during the summer if it' s offered. EOS 6 0 12 That does sound like a good idea. I am just so disappointed I' m not sure if it is worth it. EOS 6 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I know what you mean. I failed a Calc class once and I felt so empty inside. But I pulled myself together to take it again and passed it. I think you can do it too.
5 1 0 [Question] Hi there. How are you today? EOS 5 0 1 I' m good. how r u? EOS 5 1 2 [Question] I' m doing good today. What brings you on here? EOS 5 0 3 I' m not happy with an ex friend who talks behind my back to my current friends. EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] ugh. There' s nothing worse than that. Have you confronted the ex friend? EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking. EOS 5 1 6 [Question] oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it? EOS 5 0 7 they' re still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander. EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s an option but I hope it doesn' t go that far again. Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend? EOS 5 0 9 no. i don' t want anything to do with her. if i find out my friends take her side they will be my ex friend too. EOS 5 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand that. You don' t want two people disrespecting you.. EOS 5 0 11 absolutely not. i have a strong constitution about myself and don' t allow to be disrespected by anyone. EOS 5 1 12 [Question] I hear that! What happened in court when you went? If you don' t mind me asking. EOS 5 0 13 i tried to get an order for her to stay away from me. the first judge passed it but the second judge said it wasn' t strong enough.. EOS 5 1 14 [Question] Sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can. Has she been in contact with you? EOS 5 0 15 no. she hasn' t done anything lately for me to get a court order. if she starts anything again i will get a lawyer and sue her. EOS 5 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Seems like a good idea. Steer clear of her and don' t associate with her! Sounds like you' re doing the right thing. Keep your side of the street clean. EOS 5 0 17 absolutely will avoid her. if she ever convinces my friends should i tell them i don' t want to associate with them anymore? EOS 5 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would if I were in your shoes. You don' t need two of the same person. Know what I mean? EOS 5 0 19 yeah exactly. people need to realize who' s side to stay on. EOS 5 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] LOL if only everyone had that thought process. Some people don' t get it! EOS 5 0 21 it' s easier said than done. a lot of people are afraid of being alone and will put up with garbage. EOS 5 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Definitely sounds like you have the right tools and mindset to do the right thing! I know about the alone thing especially in these times.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello.:) How are you? EOS 0 0 1 I am okay. A little anxious I am feeling helpless. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am sorry to hear that. What are you feeling helpless about?
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, my name is Rose, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi Rose. I' m ok, but I get embarrassed about my curly hair. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What about your hair is embarrasing exactly? Curls seem like a lovely thing to have( mine is dead straight, lets trade lol) But no, seriously, what in particular don' t you like about it? i admire people who have natural curls. EOS 4 0 3 They are unruly and not the pretty kind of curls. Often get frizzy by the end of the day. It get' s frustrating when I always look a mess. EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I could see that being frustrating, if you can' t keep them neat. is your hair short or long? EOS 4 0 5 It is long. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you thought of having it shorter, it might be easier to tame? Just a thought.... you say you always look like a mess... is that your personal opinion or has anyone else commented on your hair?
0 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? I am feeling rather sad. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hi there. Yes, What is making you sad? EOS 0 0 2 I feel that my friends do not like me very much any more. Apparently they have been engaging in group activities without me. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello, how may i help you today? EOS 2 0 1 hi. I am not sure I offended my close friend, I' m scared, he will see pictures of the car I bought for my wife today on my status. actually, I have initial plan to get the a as a birthday gift for my wife before he came to ask for the money. EOS 2 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so you are scared your friend will get mad at you for buying your wife a car after he came asking for money from you? is that correct? EOS 2 0 3 I don' t know how to explain the matter, why I can' t borrow him the money. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] Have you talked to him recently? EOS 2 0 5 yes, you are on l ine with me. yes.

EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i know this can be a tough situation but I believe this situation will pass and everything will be ok between you to. do not let this stress you out or worry that he is mad everything will be ok. i would suggest asking him if he saw your post about the car and ask him if he is mad about it. EOS 2 0 11 ok. can I face him, to ask such question. EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you are comfortable enough facing him then ask him. Just do not force yourself if you are not comfortable doing that. EOS 2 0 13 may be I should tell one of our friends that I think he is mad at me. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if you are more comfortable texting him then i would suggest doing that but i would not just say nothing about you buying the car you should just let him know.

0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well?
4 1 0 [Question] What is going on today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling really down about my breakup. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] \ So you have had a breakup recently and you are feeling down about it. EOS 4 0 3 Yes. I thought that it wouldn' t be terrible because I initiated it but now I regret it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] So are you doubting that you made the right decision or are you just feeling sadness at the loss you are feeling right now. EOS 4 0 5 I' m mainly doubting my decision and I know there' s nothing I can do about it. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You must have had good reason' s to have made the decision to breakup and to have initiated it. Its normal to doubt yourself afterwards. You may want to remind yourself of the reasons that you came to your decision you did. Im sure the reasons are still valid. EOS 4 0 7 I did it because I' m trying to focus on self - improvement but looking back now, there' s no reason I couldn' t have improved myself with my partner. EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up. In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single.. EOS 4 0 9 That' s what I hope for. I just can' t get over missing my partner because they were great to me, I just needed to be alone. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think you are feeling a loss even though you feel that at this time you need to be alone to focus on your own growth. When you had the conversation about this breakup were you honest about why you need the space and that your problem was not with the relationship but with maybe the timing. I think with communication and after growth perhaps by keeping the door open with this person maybe you can have some sort of relationship in the future even if its friendship or maybe more. You are doing what is right for yourself at the given time. EOS 4 0 11 I did get the chance to explain my reasons a few days after the breakup. We were friendly and talked casually for a few more days and then they said they needed to space to get themselves together. We haven' t really talked since then. The problem is I' m open to something in the future but I don' t know that they are and I can' t find the courage to ask. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have been in both situations before the one who needed space and also as the one who was broken up with. I think right now the best thing you can do for you and the person is to stick with your decision and give them time they also may need space to process and deal with the breakup and growth for themselves without really letting go you won' t be able to grow in time you can have a conversation and ask but it might be six months down the road wait for them to come to you they have asked for time as you did too soon. EOS 4 0 13 I think I can do that. They needed space because it was hard going from being in a relationship to being friends in a matter of days. I guess I' ll just have to continue working on myself and see how things go. EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Focusing on yourself sounds like the best thing you can do. Start on that list of self improvements you want to make. Connect with friends you may have lost touch with. Your going to be great.
0 0 0 Hello, is anone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Yes sorry, the app was misbehaving. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I don' t know. I' m shaking because I don' t know what I' m going to do. EOS 0 1 3 [Others] Im sorry to hear that, but going to do about what situation specifically? EOS 0 0 4 I know you' re busy prepping for the holiday but I described my problem earlier. It should be listed either at the top or on the left side of your screen. I know you' re probably prepping for the holiday. I didn' t mean to interrupt your Sunday. EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Im sorry but we do not get those promps. We just get to talk pretty much, we have to find out whats going on. You are not interrupting anything. EOS 0 0 6 Here! Last Christmas I bought the condo of my dreams. This April 2020 I lost my job due Covid 19. My unemployment is ending and my savings are depleted. I' ve recived an eviction notice and don' t know what to do. Help! Have you ever been evicted? EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Where are you that you are able to be evicted? You should not be able to be evicted from your home during this time in pretty much every state. Have you tried contacting anyone for help other than your landlord? EOS 0 0 8 I' m still in my condo but I no longer have a job, umemployment has run out and my savings are all gone. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well the plus side is they cannot kick you out right now. Have you talk to your landlord about working out some payment arrangement. Have you tried applying for any job? Now is not the time for pride to get in the way, i would accept anything. EOS 0 0 10 When you say work out a plan what do you mean? I have no job. I have been applying for jobs but I haven' t received a callback or an offer of employment. Have you ever been in this situation? Also, I' m calling a helpline so Pride is not my issue. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different. I am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass. I was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures. They could work out a way you can pay extra monthly when you get back on your feet. EOS 0 0 12 It' s kind of hard to work out a plan when you don' t know where your next meal is coming from don' t you think? Do you know anything about the eviction process and where do people go once they have been evicted. Who is this they that your speaking about? I don' t mean to be crass either but I have never been jobless or homeless either. So I' m desperate here and don' t know what to do? EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Your landlord. I worked out a way with payments when i was furloughed from my job. And yes i was actually homeless many years ago so i do know what it feels like to miss out on meals for a days at a time. It seems you should look up evictions during Covid. They are not allowed to throw you on the street as long as the pandemic is going on. EOS 0 0 14 How did you eat and where did you sleep when you were homeless? How long did it take to end your situation? If you were homeless what did you say to your landlord that they still put you out? Where did you wash up or brush your teeth? EOS 0 1 15 [Question] Oh for my situation it was 100% my fault i was in a bad place during that time. I spent my time couch surfing til my friends got tired of me. Bounced around shelters after i sold my car. Washing up and brushing my teeth were the least of my problems. May i ask what state you are in?
1 0 0 im very upset. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry. Would you like to tell me about it? EOS 1 0 2 yes. i invited my friend over to watch my new puppy while i painted my room because my dog has seperation anxiety and can' t be alone. then she showed up with her new boyfriend. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] What bothered you about that? EOS 1 0 4 well i dont know him and my stuff was all out in the living room where he was alone for most of the day. i actually didnt suspect anything would happen at first. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can see why that would upset you though. Did something happen? EOS 1 0 6 yes, after they left, i started putting my stuff back in my room and realized the purse i keep my nintendo switch in was GONE. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m so sorry that happened to you. I would be very upset as well. EOS 1 0 8 i' ve known her for 8 years. but this guy is very new. they' re not even officially together. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Did you speak to your friend about it? EOS 1 0 10 yes, so i called her and asked her if she saw my bag and she got defensive. she started talking about how much money he has and how he doesnt have to steal. EOS 1 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It is sometimes hard for people to believe someone they care about could do something bad. EOS 1 0 12 but she should care about me more!! she barely knows him. EOS 1 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have been in a similar situation with a friend and her husband; when he was exhibiiing bad behavior, she did not want to see it in him. I agree that she should value you your friendship more than someone she just met. EOS 1 0 14 last time we went out for brunch, he literally tried to make her pay for it! that' s not the behavior of someone that has money like she claims. she' s delusional. EOS 1 1 15 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are worried about your friend putting her trust into this guy. EOS 1 0 16 im worried about how i' m going to get my switch back. i dont have money for a new one. im thinking of calling the cops. EOS 1 1 17 [Others] I think if you talk to her again and tell her you are looking out for her best interests it may help open a conversation. If you do end up calling the cops, at least you will have tried to speak with her first. EOS 1 0 18 i should tell her that i am thinking about calling the cops, at least. or maybe not cuz she might tell him. then he can get rid of it. i think she is working with him, maybe, or at least covering for him. EOS 1 1 19 [Question] Knowing your friend, do you really think she would do that? EOS 1 0 20 i think she would cover him, maybe, or try to avoid the truth. but no i dont think she would plot with him. EOS 1 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you really care about your friend, and want the best for her. She may not realize this but you are doing the right thing. EOS 1 0 22 i' m sure she' ll come forward if i give her time. thank you for your help. EOS 1 1 23 [Greeting] I hope that she does the right thing and that you can stay friends. Good luck to you.
0 0 0 I have anxiety about what avenue to take academically. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello! Don' t worry, I am here to help. So you are saying that you are not sure what career to study? EOS 0 0 2 I do have an idea about it but I am anxious about choosing wrong and boxing myself into something I wish I hadn' t chosen. EOS 0 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Even if you chose wrong, you will generally have plenty of time to make up your mind and choose something that you really like:), plus, you can reach out to academic advisors, for example. EOS 0 0 4 I suppose you' re right, I think I don' t have confidence in myself that what ever I do choose, I will be good at it. Good enough to make a life out of it. fear of failing myself because i lose interest in things over time. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently. EOS 0 0 6 but what if that thing is your career choice? EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is a totally normal aspect of human nature. It' s normal to get bored of things even if we really liked them at some point. Of course, some topics like those are more serious, but as I said, even if you chosed wrong, you can always change your major.
2 0 0 hi. EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hey! How are you? EOS 2 0 2 trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once:( EOS 2 1 3 [Question] What are these thoughts?:) EOS 2 0 4 Its so stupid. I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts just come so fast. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while. EOS 2 0 6 tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes I cant controll the thoughts or like I dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing. EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] A chemical thing, so maybe you need a counsellor, and then he can assess your problem, and everything will be alright:) EOS 2 0 8 I have one and it helps sometimes. I try to meditate. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. Does it help you? If it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently. EOS 2 0 10 i pretty much have to do it constantly. EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not constantly. because then you won' t have anytime to do anything else, but if negative thoughts always come into your head, maybe try doing something you enjoy doing. EOS 2 0 12 yeah maybe its as simple as that. I know Im the problem cause its very obvious that im the on ein control of the thoughts for the most part. EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, maybe. But always look at the bright side of stuff and maybe the negative thoughts can stop. EOS 2 0 14 right. I will try and start that more today and commit to it. EOS 2 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes that' s the spirit! And with that mind set good things will always come to you! EOS 2 0 16 yes i agree. when i consistently use meditation and positive attitude, any bad things are defintely minimized. EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, as long as you keep focused and not divert into any other thoughts:) EOS 2 0 18 yes. do you meditate?' EOS 2 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I do it once a week and it really helps. I used to do it more often when I felt I couldn' t do anything right, so always do it according to the situation. EOS 2 0 20 do you want to keep talking or should we wrap up? i could go either way. EOS 2 1 21 [Others] Yes. If you want to.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, what brings you to seek support, today? EOS 4 0 1 I am having ongoing depression. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin? EOS 4 0 3 I have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It first began a couple of weeks ago. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I am sad and anxious about the coronavirus. I miss seeing my friends and family. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you must really care about your friends and family, and this awful pandemic is prevent your from seeing them. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, definitely. I hope the pandemic will end. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all? EOS 4 0 9 I haven' t thought about dying at all. I take medication each day for my depression, but there are times when I still feel sad. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay, thanks for sharing that personal information. I only ask because thoughts of suicide are normal and anxiety and depression increase the chances of suicide. EOS 4 0 11 You' re welcome. I understand, but I am not suicidal. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] What would you like to talk about, then? We could talk about the problem more, or if you feel like it is defined, we could talk about solutions, or not talk about solutions at all. What would make you feel better? EOS 4 0 13 I would like to talk about solutions since I feel like the problem is defined. EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I know what it is like to be depressed. I also take medication for this. For solutions, studies show that working out and exercising can help depression. Have you considered this? EOS 4 0 15 Yes, I enjoy taking walks and doing a cardio workout at home. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] That' s great! What ways do you think you could communicate more with your family? EOS 4 0 17 I could communicate more with my family by calling them on the phone, texting, emailing, or talking to them on Zoom. EOS 4 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You listed a lot of good solutions such as zoom and texting. Do you think doing that would make you feel less depressed? EOS 4 0 19 Yes, I think that Zoom and texting would make me feel less depressed. EOS 4 1 20 [Others] Well, let me ask you this. I noticed that you had many solutions off - hand that you could tell me, and you also said it could help you with your depression. May I ask what is keeping you from using these methods? EOS 4 0 21 Wanting to stay in bed is keeping me from using these methods. EOS 4 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh, I completely understand. Depression has that effect. But maybe you can talk to your loved ones while in bed? How do you feel about that? EOS 4 0 23 I feel okay about that. EOS 4 1 24 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, it' s worth a try, right!
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! What can I do to help? EOS 0 0 1 Hello, I' m not sure if there is any help? Without knowing when I can return to work, I will probably remain anxious about the unknown. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m glad to speak to you today. It sounds like you are having anxious thoughts. Can you tell me more? EOS 0 0 3 i am self employed, selling event tickets on the internet, but because of covid, all events are postponed until it is safe to gather in large numbers.

Are you able to find work or help from the government?
1 0 0 Hi. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello though, how has life been treating you lately?
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours?

EOS 0 0 3 yeah... i have not been able to meet with my boyfriend physically due to the corona lockdown, and when i finally got to see him last month i discovered that he is cheating on me. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am so sorry that you had to go through that, I know this is a very difficult time for you. Has your boyfriend reached out to you at all to clarify things or to see if you are okay? EOS 0 0 5 he has but it is not sounding convincing enough. i feel so hurt. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Just By chatting with you, I can feel how hurt and upset you are. Is there anyone that can provide you support at home during this time? EOS 0 0 7 there is nobody i can talk to about this, i dont really have friends and my siblings are busy with their lives. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] This is a very challenging time for you especially when there is lack of support. I do feel your pain, And I would like to share some advise and suggestions which may alleviate some of the hurt and pain you are going through. Would you e open to hear them out? EOS 0 0 9 sure, thanks for this. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Mindfulness and yoga have proven to help overcome feelings of low mood and perhaps you could try with taking a few deep breaths and listening to some calming music before going to bed tonight. Do you think that, you can try something like this?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 4 1 2 [Greeting] I am good how are you.

EOS 4 0 3 i lost those books, I cannot even explain, how it happen. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have lost some books? Were they important to you?

EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Try not to worry, it is entirely possible that someone has found them and handed them in to the authorities. You might still get them back!
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, what brings you to seek support, today? EOS 4 0 1 I am having ongoing depression. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m very sorry to hear that.

It first began a couple of weeks ago. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I am sad and anxious about the coronavirus.

EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay, thanks for sharing that personal information.

We could talk about the problem more, or if you feel like it is defined, we could talk about solutions, or not talk about solutions at all. What would make you feel better? EOS 4 0 13 I would like to talk about solutions since I feel like the problem is defined. EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I know what it is like to be depressed. I also take medication for this.

I noticed that you had many solutions off - hand that you could tell me, and you also said it could help you with your depression. May I ask what is keeping you from using these methods? EOS 4 0 21 Wanting to stay in bed is keeping me from using these methods. EOS 4 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh, I completely understand. Depression has that effect. But maybe you can talk to your loved ones while in bed? How do you feel about that?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hello, thank you for signing up to listen to me. I could be better but thank you for asking. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What' s on your mind? EOS 4 0 3 I am upset about the loss of my best friend' s son dying in a car accident. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I' m really sorry to hear that. When did this happen? EOS 4 0 5 The accident was Thursday February 25th but he held on until Sunday the 28th. He was only 26 years old. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There' s nothing that can prepare you for unexpected tragedies like this. We just have to deal with them as they come. EOS 4 0 7 I understand what you are saying but that' s the problem. How to deal with such a terrible unexpected loss. I feel helpless because there is nothing I can do to make her feel better. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you' re sticking close to your friend, although it doesn' t feel like its helping. It' s my experience that when someone has experienced a traumatic loss like that, making someone feel better, at least right away, isn' t always an option. The most important thing you can do for her is just to be there for her and allow her to feel however she needs to feel right now.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, my name is Rose, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi Rose. I' m ok, but I get embarrassed about my curly hair. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What about your hair is embarrasing exactly? Curls seem like a lovely thing to have( mine is dead straight, lets trade lol) But no, seriously, what in particular don' t you like about it? i admire people who have natural curls. EOS 4 0 3 They are unruly and not the pretty kind of curls. Often get frizzy by the end of the day. It get' s frustrating when I always look a mess. EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I could see that being frustrating, if you can' t keep them neat. is your hair short or long? EOS 4 0 5 It is long. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you thought of having it shorter, it might be easier to tame? Just a thought.... you say you always look like a mess... is that your personal opinion or has anyone else commented on your hair? EOS 4 0 7 I started to cut it shorter last time, but my stylist said it would be big. It is hard to find the right product.. It is my personal opinion.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you asked a friend for an honest opinion? EOS 4 0 9 My friend likes my hair, but also says she can see that it is hard to manage. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance.. EOS 4 0 11 I can totally relate to that. I think we always want what we dont have. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One thing I have started doing, since my hair hasn' t been cut for a year due to pandemic, is wearing hats. my hair is driving me crazy, so I get your frustration. Is it long enough to braid? EOS 4 0 13 I went a year without cutting mine as well for the same reason. That is probably why it felt so out of control now that you say that. Now that I am vaccinated I just got it cut. Maybe I will like it better now. Yes, I do like braids. That is a good idea. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] yay! a haircut!!! Congrats. EOS 4 0 15 Thank you. It does make it feel a little better. I hope you can get yours cut soon too. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] one last suggestion: ask more stylists' opinions perhaps? oh thankyou.... had my shot yesterday.... now I have to wait for our lockdown to expire( May 20) so I have a bit more shag to go. EOS 4 0 17 Yes, good idea. It seems it has been so long to be able to do this. Maybe I need to think of a new style. Had my second shot last Thursday so I hope opportunities like a new stylist happen soon. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you googled images for short curly hairstyles?
3 0 0 hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hey. How are you? EOS 3 0 2 i am not feeling too great. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why not? EOS 3 0 4 i am not able to find a job for over 5 years. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] How have you been able to get by?
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave? EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad. EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more. I feel that everyone must know that I' ve been dumped and be laughing at me. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time. EOS 1 0 10 I did not really have any choice though. I do not see any future for myself now that we are separated. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] do you know brene brown and her work. EOS 1 0 12 No I do not, who is that? EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her TED talk and there' s a great youtube video on empathy. EOS 1 0 14 Thank you, I will. Right now I really need some sort of emotional support. I feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i bring her up because what i sounds like is that you are feeling embarrassed because your partner made a choice that wasn' t you. in reality the choice they made wasn' t about you, it was about them. EOS 1 0 16 It is not so much that - it is that I feel that I dedicated the majority of my adult life to this relationship and now there is nothing left. EOS 1 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are left and you are enough. even if you dont feel like it right now you are enough. EOS 1 0 18 I really do not feel like it right now. What was the last fifteen years all about? I wanted to have children with him and he refused but now I hear he is expecting a baby with another woman. EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] a relationship is part of who you are. it isn' t you. EOS 1 0 20 But it is very difficult to try to strike out on my own again and I do not know if I even want to. EOS 1 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it is hard. it sucks. but the voyage through the suck is going to be better for you than you may realize right now. EOS 1 0 22 But I feel that I am facing middle age on my own and I really do not want to do that. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you have survived 14 days without a bad relationship. keep on doing that day by day and before you know it, you will be on the other side of the bad feelings. EOS 1 0 24 What happens if I just can' t ever get over it though? Right now it' s hard to see any sort of way through these feelings. EOS 1 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, middle age is scary, but there are so many things you can do. ageism is out.
3 0 0 Hello. Hello? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hey how are you doing?. EOS 3 0 2 Doing alright, thanks. Yourself? EOS 3 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing fine, thank you.. EOS 3 0 4 Good to hear. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 6 I' ve been feeling very down lately. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] That sounds difficult, Would you like to elaborate on that? EOS 3 0 8 Sure. I feel depressed about the state of the US and of the rest of the world. It' s very overwhelming.. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now. EOS 3 0 10 Yes and a lot of uncetainty. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Most definitely, I' ve also been feeling a bit overwhelmed by what' s going on. How have you been coping? EOS 3 0 12 It' s good to know others feel the way I do. I' ve been trying to keep busy and not watch the news too much. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a good strategy, all the news outlets can be very overwhelming.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello, how may i help you today? EOS 2 0 1 hi. I am not sure I offended my close friend, I' m scared, he will see pictures of the car I bought for my wife today on my status. actually, I have initial plan to get the a as a birthday gift for my wife before he came to ask for the money. EOS 2 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so you are scared your friend will get mad at you for buying your wife a car after he came asking for money from you? is that correct? EOS 2 0 3 I don' t know how to explain the matter, why I can' t borrow him the money. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] Have you talked to him recently? EOS 2 0 5 yes, you are on l ine with me. yes. EOS 2 1 6 [Question] Has he said anything about the car? EOS 2 0 7 no, he saw the post of the car on my status, but he did' nt say anything. EOS 2 1 8 [Question] do you think he is mad at you? EOS 2 0 9 yes, naturally he will congratulate me as he viewed the pictures. EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i know this can be a tough situation but I believe this situation will pass and everything will be ok between you to. do not let this stress you out or worry that he is mad everything will be ok. i would suggest asking him if he saw your post about the car and ask him if he is mad about it. EOS 2 0 11 ok. can I face him, to ask such question. EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you are comfortable enough facing him then ask him. Just do not force yourself if you are not comfortable doing that.
4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out. EOS 4 0 6 I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night? EOS 4 0 8 I can' t sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it' s typically late afternoon. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds like you are doing the very best you can under difficult circumstances. you should feel very proud about that. EOS 4 0 10 thank you. i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] it sounds to me that your sleep issue is really weighing on your mind. you may be setting yourself up for sleep issues by thinking about this so much. is that possible? EOS 4 0 12 yes it may be. i' m not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you' re under a lot of pressure. it' s only natural that you would feel overwhelmed. dont be hard on yourself. you' re doing the best you can. EOS 4 0 14 thank you. that is very supportive. i just dont know how to make the next ten days go by faster. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can spend some time doing pleasant things. it is true that time seems to go fast when we' re having fun. EOS 4 0 16 that' s true. i thought about maybe playing video games. EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] fantastic! that' s a great way to spend your time. EOS 4 0 18 maybe overwatch. i haven' t been playing them much. EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] i' m wondering: are you a reader? do you enjoy reading? i' m asking because i find when i read a good book, time seems to move very quickly. EOS 4 0 20 i am. but i have a hard time focusing as of late. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can make a goal of reading a few pages and then see if you can build on that. then, if you want, you can make a goal of reading a chapter. EOS 4 0 22 that' s a great idea. that may help a lot with focus. EOS 4 1 23 [Self-disclosure] personally i love reading; especially non fiction. what type of books do you enjoy? EOS 4 0 24 dystopian fantasy style books. and also historical nonfiction. EOS 4 1 25 [Self-disclosure] i enjoy historical non fiction very much. do you have any favorite authors? EOS 4 0 26 lauren destefano. her series the chemical garden trilogy is my favorite. EOS 4 1 27 [Question] has she written anything you haven' t read yet that you think you would enjoy? EOS 4 0 28 that' s also another good idea. i haven' t read all of her bookis. EOS 4 1 29 [Question] do you live near a library? EOS 4 0 30 i do but they' re closed because of covid. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] there may be some libraries in your area that are open, or have reduced hours. EOS 4 0 32 i can try. the bookstores are open. EOS 4 1 33 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wonderful! do you live near a book store? EOS 4 0 34 sorta but not that close but i can take the bus out there. EOS 4 1 35 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you can call the store and see if they have anything written by your favorite author. EOS 4 0 36 that' s a great idea. EOS 4 1 37 [Providing Suggestions or Information] getting back to the sleep issue, have you considered thinking some pleasant thoughts before going to bed? EOS 4 0 38 i try but i get too stresed. EOS 4 1 39 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i can understand that. the stress is interfering with your thoughts but you are still doing a good job. you are doing the best you can do; that' s the best anyone can do.
4 0 0 Hi I am so sad my boyfriend was cheating and broke up with me when I found out. I don' t think I can ever be happy again. EOS 4 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self - esteem is that true? EOS 4 0 2 I have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. I have lost interest in everything I can barely make myself go to work. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better? EOS 4 0 4 Maybe, why would he cheat? I have seen her she is not that pretty. I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination. EOS 4 1 5 [Others] remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren' t right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else. EOS 4 0 6 I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn' t want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn' t mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that. EOS 4 0 8 I trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. I thought we were so perfect together, I don' t want him back I could never trust him again, I am not sure I could trust any guy right now, I am so hurt and confused. I don' t ever want to feel like this again. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] relationship issues, especially when they and suddenly can be one of the most stressful periods in an adults life. you are not alone in that other people have been through similar experiences themselves. EOS 4 0 10 This was the first guy I ever lived with, I thought we would get married one day. How do people make it through the pain, it actually hurts. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?. EOS 4 0 12 I have a couple acquaintances at work but I wouldn' t want to discuss my personal life with, my mom said to have a good cry but I almost couldn' t stop once I started. He was my best friend and who I talked to once we got together I didn' t seem to need anyone else which looks like a mistake now. That is why I am here for support. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ok I understand. It is normal to be upset in a situation like this. When I ask if there is someone to talk to, I meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup. There are also support groups out there that can really help. Getting your emotions out and seeing that others struggle with the same issue may be a very good thing. EOS 4 0 14 Have you ever had a break up of a serious relationship or know someone who has? Does the aching inside ever get better? How long will it take? EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] When I was younger, my girlfriend cheated on me. We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it' s better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married. I loved her but after she cheated, I couldn' t stand the sight of her. I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy. EOS 4 0 16 I am sorry that happened to you but glad it turned out well in the end. You have a good point that it is better to know now than after we got married. I do have a nice neighbor who expressed concern when he noticed my boyfriend was gone. He said if I ever needed someone to talk to he was there. I thought he was just being nice. Maybe I should go talk to him some time maybe he was sincere. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think that that would be a good idea! for info, In terms of how long it takes to get over it. I have read a statistic that is takes half the length of the relationship to truly get over it. Personally I think it does depend on the person and how things end in terms of the breakup. EOS 4 0 18 Thank you for checking on that for me, I hope it is quicker I would hate to feel this way that long. I think I will go see him he is home right now. You have made me feel hopeful and that there will be an end to these feelings and maybe things will go as well for me as they did you. Thank you again. EOS 4 1 19 [Greeting] You are very welcome!
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. EOS 3 0 16 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. EOS 3 0 18 That is a good point.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. EOS 3 0 20 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand. EOS 3 0 22 I should trust my partner more than any random person. EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters. EOS 3 0 24 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? EOS 3 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you.... even after work. EOS 3 0 26 okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. EOS 3 0 28 That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you? EOS 3 0 30 Okay. I will keep that in mind. We are 22. EOS 3 1 31 [Question] Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? EOS 3 0 32 Yes but less over the past few months. EOS 3 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related.... for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. EOS 3 0 34 That' s understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. EOS 3 1 35 [Providing Suggestions or Information] How do you all generally communicate? Through text? EOS 3 0 36 He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends.. EOS 3 1 37 [Question] Which do you and your man like to communicate? EOS 3 0 38 No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something. EOS 3 1 39 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot. EOS 3 0 40 You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help.. EOS 3 1 41 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position.
2 0 0 Good evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hi, how' s things? EOS 2 0 2 Things are ok I am just having issues with the problem above. EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I am afraid that I am not able to see that.. can you tell me about it? EOS 2 0 4 Yes, so I have always done very well in school and university. I have always had A' s or high B' s. Last semester in university, I failed one of my exams. I still passed the class with an A, but for some reason, that exam haunts me and gives me bad dreams. I don' t know why it happens and it worries me. EOS 2 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - when I was sitting my final exams I constantly had nightmares about failing. Nearly thirty years on and I still do!! But - you did really very well and you passed with an A. Do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself? EOS 2 0 6 Maybe, I got a 46% on the exam( so an F) but I did all my other assignments and exams almost perfect and got an A overall. I never once failed a test in my life, and have always held myself to a very high academic degree to make my parents proud. I come from a poor family, so succeeding in life is very important to m, e. me* EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds as though you feel that academic success is the most important thing in your life, would I be right in thinking this? EOS 2 0 8 Yes you are correct. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered talking to anyone about these feelings of perfectionism? A therapist perhaps? There is a good deal of useful help and information out there for people who are struggling. EOS 2 0 10 I have not, actually. I don' t think my family can afford a therapist, especially with the pandemic raging right now. Where do you recommend going? EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Does your school have any counsellors offering help for free? Many do. I believe that there are some charities that will offer a certain number of free therapy sessions too.
1 1 0 [Question] hi. how can i help you? EOS 1 0 1 hi. i am really angry. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] are you saying that you are angry now? what happened dear? EOS 1 0 3 really angry at my friend. EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] can you tell me what happened so that i can understand? EOS 1 0 5 i told him a secret about my self in private and he played a stupid pranks that reveals it to other people i don' t like. EOS 1 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s ok dear. did you asked him why he did that? EOS 1 0 7 he said he was drunk. EOS 1 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] just remember, yesterday is gone. there is really nothing you can do about the situation. you better keep your distance from that particular person. EOS 1 0 9 ok. and i already keep my distance from him. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] learn from your mistake and don' t do it again dear. EOS 1 0 11 yes i won' t. funny thing is he didn' t remember what he did that night. EOS 1 1 12 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah. we can' t control others. right? EOS 1 0 13 absolutely. EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes. it totally depends on how mature the person is. just forgive him and keep in mind for next time whether you should share something with him or not.
3 0 0 Hello. Hello? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hey how are you doing?. EOS 3 0 2 Doing alright, thanks. Yourself? EOS 3 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing fine, thank you.. EOS 3 0 4 Good to hear. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 6 I' ve been feeling very down lately. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] That sounds difficult, Would you like to elaborate on that? EOS 3 0 8 Sure. I feel depressed about the state of the US and of the rest of the world. It' s very overwhelming.. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now. EOS 3 0 10 Yes and a lot of uncetainty. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Most definitely, I' ve also been feeling a bit overwhelmed by what' s going on. How have you been coping? EOS 3 0 12 It' s good to know others feel the way I do. I' ve been trying to keep busy and not watch the news too much. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a good strategy, all the news outlets can be very overwhelming. EOS 3 0 14 Yes with lots of conflicting information. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] What do you like to do to keep busy? EOS 3 0 16 Work, read, exercise. I' ve been going to the gym more. EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Those sound like really good coping skills.
4 1 0 [Question] Good evening. What would you like to talk about? EOS 4 0 1 evening. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you feeling at the moment? EOS 4 0 3 i lost those books, I cannot even explain, how it happen. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have lost some books? Were they important to you? EOS 4 0 5 I price one of the books, Amazon said 1000. yes. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] So you have lost a book that is worth a thousand dollars? I can imagine you are feeling really bad about that. EOS 4 0 7 where will I g et almost 3 thousand dollars. It is too painful. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I do not know.. have you considered taking an extra job on the side? EOS 4 0 9 yes, i do. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to get help with finding the books? Someone could have handed them in. EOS 4 0 11 school, should just give me enough time to find the books. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you have any idea of where you lost them? EOS 4 0 13 allow me to clear myself later, it is a fucking thing. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] I am sorry, I do not understand what you mean. EOS 4 0 15 I am trying to find that out, I packed them inside one bag, may be someone carried the bag or I misplace them. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Try not to worry, it is entirely possible that someone has found them and handed them in to the authorities. You might still get them back! EOS 4 0 17 i need enough time to look for the books, but school is not ready to listen to me. EOS 4 1 18 [Question] That is really not fair of them. Is there a higher authority you can take your case to? EOS 4 0 19 you are right. EOS 4 1 20 [Self-disclosure] They really should be doing more to help you. I know how frustrating it feels to lose something valuable. I did lose a really expensive ring one time but I got it back a week later. EOS 4 0 21 yes, it is fuck giving me headache. EOS 4 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand why it would be! Please try not to worry, all is not lost. EOS 4 0 23 I just need time, I will check the CCTV of my room, and check around. EOS 4 1 24 [Greeting] That is a good idea. I hope that they have not been deliberately stolen. EOS 4 0 25 I guest so. EOS 4 1 26 [Question] Well, I hope that I have been able to offer some useful suggestions. Do you feel a bit better about things now?
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Somewhat stressed but otherwise ok. How about you? EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I am great, it snowed and looks like Christmas here. Why are you so stressed? EOS 0 0 4 I' m developing romantic feelings for a friend but she doesn' t share those feelings with me in return. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. I have been there myself.. Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend? EOS 0 0 6 Yes, I had received that advice from someone and tried it but it didn' t help. We have been friends for a long time and I think it would be tough to smother these romantic feelings. EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Have you thought about talking with this friend about these feelings? EOS 0 0 8 I have but I' m sure she wouldn' t react very well and it could damage our relationship.. I' m also pretty sure she' s already aware. She' s pretty sharp. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well maybe you should address these feelings with her in a very relaxed public atmosphere. Just let her know that you really like her and you have realized that she has many of the qualities that you look for in a person to get serious with. However, you treasure your friendship more than anything and you do not want anything to come in between your friendship.... this way you have addressed your feelings, she knows how you feel and then should she decide to every take the friendship to the next step, she wouldn' t feel awkward.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Much better than normal, even though the stock market is down. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Are you an investor? EOS 0 0 3 I am a student that tries to put as much money into as possible. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand the struggle with being at that stage in life. Has this affected you negatively? EOS 0 0 5 No the stock market really doesn' t cause stress for me, mostly just small things that I think my brain overreacts to. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] What sorts of things? EOS 0 0 7 Kind of a variety of things. I typically get bad anxiety after a night of going out. So I am trying to cut out drinking. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety? Do you suffer from anxiety when you do not drink ever?
3 1 0 [Question] hi there? EOS 3 0 1 Hi. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] how are you? what' s new with you? EOS 3 0 3 I am not doing so great. I fell down some stairs the other day and broke my foot and chipped my two front teeth. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that. I feel you because I had an experience about breaking my bones. It was sad story. how you feel right now.
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why? EOS 4 0 8 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID - 19 lockdowns. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] How long have you been working there? EOS 4 0 10 I am very sad about this country and my work situation. For 5 years. I work in accounting. EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID - 19 really has got us all down. EOS 4 0 12 What a great nation we live in..... a future 3rd world one. Yeah, but I was a good accountant. EOS 4 1 13 [Others] WOW, I' m sure that is a big change for you... EOS 4 0 14 Yeah, I have not told my wife about it just yet. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] I agree, this country has got some issues but we can get through them. Uh, oh, how do you think she will react? EOS 4 0 16 Yeah, I am not sure. I better wait to break the news in 2021. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there. EOS 4 0 18 And I am not the only one who is losing my job. Seems that all of accounting is going to be getting the axe. It makes me sad.... EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year. Do you have a resume? EOS 4 0 20 Plus, I have a 50 dollar a day spending habit on lottery tickets to one day hit it BIG. Yes, I have a resume that I have not updated just yet. I have a college education and a CPA to boot, but I need one lucky break in life. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes that will help to get a better perspective on things... taking some time away from everything in order to catch a breath. EOS 4 0 22 Maybe I can spend some quality time with my kids without them knowing I will be out of a job as of 01/ 15/ 2021. It is almost Christmas, too. EOS 4 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I hear ya, I feel like that quite a bit. Like if isn' t one thing it' s another. I' m sure your wife will understand how the economy has gotten and that she knows that it isn' t your fault. EOS 4 0 24 Maybe, but we have a huge mortgage and two BMW' s. We spend lavishly.... Plus, I spend 50 dollars a day on lotto. EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times, but remember all the good times you have had. Those would not be good times if it were' nt for tough times. EOS 4 0 26 True, but the Office was my home away from home. I need to figure out how to deal with my sadness..... EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times. Do you have any hobbies? EOS 4 0 28 Yeah, that is a good point. Should I change careers? I like to walk and do pushups on a regular basis; does that count?? EOS 4 1 29 [Others] I don' t think a huge change like that is neccessary, maybe just looking into options. Unemployment and government help until something else comes up. That is an excellent way to help relieve some stress from our daily lives. EOS 4 0 30 Unemployment doesn' t last forever; plus, I have pride in my work. Americans are suppose to be strong. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Exercise also releases endorphins that can make you feel happy. EOS 4 0 32 Any other suggestions? I was thinking about becoming an Uber and Lyft driver. The happiness wears off, however. EOS 4 1 33 [Reflection of feelings] I like to hear that, I am a proud American myself.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I' m a little bummed because my friend is not only a junkie but he got arrested last week. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ouch! Your friend got arrested for drugs last week? EOS 3 0 3 He got arrested for stealing to fund his addiction. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I had a neighbor who was doing meth, and he got arrested, and that actually saved his life. He had to get sober and look at what he was doing. There is a hard line between helping a friend who is addicted and actually enabling them. Have you ever heard of this? EOS 3 0 5 Sadly my friend has been arrested a few times, spent time in prison, and is fully locked in his lifestyle. He' s such a great person, very funny, nice, but he is lost. EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It can be very hard to watch a loved one destroy their lives. Has anyone every discussed an intervention? EOS 3 0 7 He has alienated all of his friends, including me. I was the last one holding on. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] My husband and I actually have worked with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. We are retired now, but still volunteer. Sometimes we have to let go of our loved ones - they have to hit rock bottom. Very hard to do, but unless they see their behavior as destructive, they don' t want to change.
6 0 0 Hello, how are you?. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 6 0 2 I' m alright, honestly I' m feeling rather ashamed. The reason for that and the problem that I' m facing is that I' ve had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and I' m only 24 years old. Right now in my life I' m ready to seek help, but I' m having a lot of anxiety about it because I' m very worried about how others will judge me. I' m worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that I will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. I' m ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that I' ve made that have gotten me here and I guess my problem is that I just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that I can just finally make the step that I need so desperately and get help. EOS 6 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am in a good position to help you as I am in the same situation. Please know you are not alone. I would definitely recommend seeking help sooner rather than later! Hello? Are you wanting to talk? EOS 6 0 4 Yes of course I didn' t hear it go off, my apologies. I really appreciate that, it really is helpful knowing that I' m not the only one who feels this way. I really know that that' s what I need to do, and I am trying my best to get over my fears and just do it ya know. EOS 6 1 5 [Question] What level of alcohol consumption do you have?

EOS 3 0 11 Yes my wife is everything to me and can not imagine loosing her due to some avoidable reasons. EOS 3 1 12 [Others] That should be the spirit. Now nothing can make you apart. Drinking is very easy for you to quit now. you will definitely get a success. EOS 3 0 13 Thank you. EOS 3 1 14 [Greeting] No problem! That' s why I am here to help you. Have a wonderful life ahead!

We have been friends for a long time and I think it would be tough to smother these romantic feelings. EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Have you thought about talking with this friend about these feelings?
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 I' m sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What happened? EOS 4 0 3 My ex - boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Why did he break up with you? EOS 4 0 5 because I didn' t trust him and I was always jelous. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think you should try finding a psychologist to help your jealous. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I think so, because I should not feel like that, I should trust him. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Apparently psychologist is good for people who want to share feelings and emotions.

EOS 5 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] its only in your mind.
0 1 0 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hello, How are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 am fine. at least for now. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] would you like to talk about it? EOS 0 0 3 yeah... i have not been able to meet with my boyfriend physically due to the corona lockdown, and when i finally got to see him last month i discovered that he is cheating on me. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am so sorry that you had to go through that, I know this is a very difficult time for you. Has your boyfriend reached out to you at all to clarify things or to see if you are okay? EOS 0 0 5 he has but it is not sounding convincing enough. i feel so hurt. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Just By chatting with you, I can feel how hurt and upset you are. Is there anyone that can provide you support at home during this time? EOS 0 0 7 there is nobody i can talk to about this, i dont really have friends and my siblings are busy with their lives. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] This is a very challenging time for you especially when there is lack of support. I do feel your pain, And I would like to share some advise and suggestions which may alleviate some of the hurt and pain you are going through. Would you e open to hear them out? EOS 0 0 9 sure, thanks for this. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Mindfulness and yoga have proven to help overcome feelings of low mood and perhaps you could try with taking a few deep breaths and listening to some calming music before going to bed tonight. Do you think that, you can try something like this? EOS 0 0 11 yoga sounds interesting but i will try starting it by weekend. some calming music will do at the moment. any suggestions for me? EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am so proud of you for giving this a try. I would like to suggest OCB relaxing music, which will help you relax.

Just rest assured that I will be here for you should you need to talk to some one and I will do my best to support and guide you. EOS 0 0 15 thank you for calming words. EOS 0 1 16 [Others] Have a great day.
4 1 0 [Question] hi how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Not good, i am very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i' m sorry. whats making you sad? EOS 4 0 3 My friend just stopped talking to me and she won' t tell me the reason why. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] has she communicated via text or messanger? or has all communication stopped? EOS 4 0 5 She stopped communicating completely. Doesn' t even reply to me texts. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] i' m so sorry to hear that. i had a friend do that to me right after the spring pandemic lockdown. did this happen recently? EOS 4 0 7 Yes, just this past week. How did you deal with your situation? EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] i was upset, but then after thinking about it more, i figured she just was overwhelmed with everything going on. i gave her the benefit of the doubt and texted happy birthday this summer and didn' t hear anything back. can you think of anything going on with her that might cause her to stop communicating? EOS 4 0 9 That' s too bad. I suppose that one should be able to let the other person know when you no; longer want to be friends with them. That way one can move on quickly. I am completely unaware. We haven' t had any argument of late so i am completely clueless. Wish she would just reach out. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] i can imagine it' s hard to put those feeling into words when you want to move on. EOS 4 0 11 Exactly. Do you know of any online resources that one can use to get through such situations? EOS 4 1 12 [Question] but, it' s left you feeling sad. how are things going otherwise?
7 0 0 Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well. EOS 7 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well I can help you study if you' d like? EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material... EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study! EOS 7 0 4 My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted. EOS 7 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version. EOS 7 0 6 Wow, that' s actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me. EOS 7 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot. EOS 7 0 8 That is true. I will reach out to her now. EOS 7 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will do just fine, you can do it!
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 6 0 1 hi. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing? EOS 6 0 3 Well I' m distraught. EOS 6 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel that way? EOS 6 0 5 Because my girlfriend has left me. EOS 6 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard for you. I haven' t personally had to deal with that, but I have had friends that have. How long were you together? EOS 6 0 7 four years. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being together that long must have made that break up difficult. How are you coping with it? EOS 6 0 9 well I' m not really, especially as she' d gone off with someone else. But I' m to blame which makes it worse. EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened?
4 0 0 hi, how are you? My friend, My best friend, has a new friend and hardly has time for me anymore, we have been friend for over ten years. this hurts. EOS 4 1 1 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before. EOS 4 0 2 its so annoying and hurtful. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Yeah i can tell you something you might not want to hear but it ended with us ending our friendship on that level. EOS 4 0 4 i definitely do not want to end our friendship, that would be even more painful. EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years. We still hang out but it isnt like it was before. People move on to others and it hurts. They usually are not trying to hurt us though.
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. EOS 3 0 16 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. EOS 3 0 18 That is a good point.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. EOS 3 0 20 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand. EOS 3 0 22 I should trust my partner more than any random person. EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters. EOS 3 0 24 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? EOS 3 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you.... even after work. EOS 3 0 26 okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. EOS 3 0 28 That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you? EOS 3 0 30 Okay. I will keep that in mind. We are 22. EOS 3 1 31 [Question] Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? EOS 3 0 32 Yes but less over the past few months. EOS 3 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related.... for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. EOS 3 0 34 That' s understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. EOS 3 1 35 [Providing Suggestions or Information] How do you all generally communicate? Through text? EOS 3 0 36 He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends.. EOS 3 1 37 [Question] Which do you and your man like to communicate? EOS 3 0 38 No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something. EOS 3 1 39 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot. EOS 3 0 40 You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help.. EOS 3 1 41 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you. EOS 3 0 42 Do you think getting other people involved is a good idea? EOS 3 1 43 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would be subtle about that tactic.. If you haven' t met any of his school mates. I wouldn' t pursue that option. Have you met any of his class mates?

EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Well, I went through a similar situation when a pink - eye breakout hurt my school.... I struggled financially, but took any job I could..... EOS 2 0 7 What kind of jobs did you take? EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Work part - time and go to school part - time. EOS 2 0 9 I' m trying to find a steady job. jobs that can help support both my family and my tuition. EOS 2 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest creating flyers and ask to be a dog walker. Americans love their dogs. 70 Percent of Americans have dogs. EOS 2 0 11 oh okay that' s interesting. there' s a part time job at a local library should I take it? EOS 2 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I feel that you can be great and be a good entrepreneur..... dog walking doesn' t take a lot of talent. EOS 2 0 13 thank you for that. EOS 2 1 14 [Question] How close in the library? EOS 2 0 15 the library is within the campus. EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Ok, that is good. I once worked at a library. EOS 2 0 17 you did? how was the experience? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I worked in a library many years..... EOS 2 0 19 but overall was your experience working in the library pleasant? EOS 2 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] It was quite pleasant. And the pay was decent. Plus, I got to read and research a lot. I ended up meeting my wife at the library as well. I felt good taking the job.:) EOS 2 0 21 wow! that is quite the experience Tom. I might just take the job then since it went well for you. anything to help support my family and my academics during these trying times. EOS 2 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest keeping an eye out for smart and sexy w= ladies who like going there. EOS 2 0 23 haha I' ll maybe focus on the job at hand first Tom. EOS 2 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can support your family by working at the library and reading up on higher paying jobs while there.

3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello there! How can I help you this afternoon?. EOS 3 0 1 I' m just feeling really down lately and would like to talk to someone who understands. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Feeling consistently sad is a tough place to be. I' m sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 3 0 3 Thank you. I think since the pandemic it' s gotten worse. It' s hard to find the" reason" to go about my day. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand that. Are you working or attending classes from home?.
4 0 0 I' m feeling really sad, I thought it was going somewhere. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What do you mean you thought it was going somewhere? Are you okay? EOS 4 0 2 yes I' m okay, I' m so sad. five years, I gave my heart to this girl. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Did you guys break up recently? EOS 4 0 4 yes she broke my heart last night, what did I do wrong? EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong. You shouldn' t blame yourself. EOS 4 0 6 but I gave her my all. I feel so betrayed. I' m feeling so sad I want to jump over a bridge. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there, a few years before I was married, my boyfriend broke up with me. We had some space, and then were able to become friends again. And you know what? We ended up getting back together and getting married. EOS 4 0 8 you think it' s my fault? 5 years man, 5 years and just like that she broke my heart. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t give up, you never know what the future holds. I don' t know your particular situation, but it takes two to make relationships work. I don' t think you should blame yourself. EOS 4 0 10 thank you, will try to keep my head up. you think she cheated on me? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] I don' t know what happened. Is that what you think happened? EOS 4 0 12 well I don' t know. why end so abruptly. EOS 4 1 13 [Question] What did she say when you broke up? EOS 4 0 14 she just said it' s over! over the damn phone. EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Yikes! I' m sure that didn' t feel very good. EOS 4 0 16 not at all, so heart broken. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] Have you tried talking to her since? Oftentimes people have confused feelings and after some time to reflect, things might change.. EOS 4 0 18 no, she won' t pick up her phone. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] She may need some space to figure things out. I know it' s going to be tough but I believe you can get past this.
3 0 0 hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 i am ok so far. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 4 i am depressed. and need some inspiration. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression? EOS 3 0 6 Covid - 19. and money issues. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, this has really been a hard time for all of us. How has it impacted you personally?
6 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there! How may I support you?
2 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you feeling today? EOS 2 0 1 Hi. I' m feeling okayish. EOS 2 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest. EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely. I recently broke up with my girlfriend. We had been together for more than 3 years. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] What happened that made you guys break up? EOS 2 0 5 She said that she simply wasn' t in love anymore, and that she didn' t have the same feelings she did at the beginning. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have also had this situation happen to me. Maybe it just wasn' t the right timing or she had other interests. EOS 2 0 7 She was so important for me. I feel so empty.... I Feel like I' m never finding anyone like her ever again, EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I' ve had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life.
4 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling really sad and lonely right now. My boyfriend and I broke up and it was me who wanted it but now I regret breaking up and he doesn' t want me back. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, I can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it' s too late. EOS 4 0 3 That is exactly it. I broke up with him because I liked another person but then quickly realized that I made a mistake and it' s too late. I want him back should I start calling and going to his house to beg? EOS 4 1 4 [Question] nobody knows him better than you do, right now I do not think he is in a good place either since it wasn' t his choice to end it, how do you think he would react if you started pressuring him?. EOS 4 0 5 I haven' t really thought of that yet. He has a pretty short temper actually. I know he is really mad at me so I think he might want to yell at me and get his anger out before he could start being nice to me again. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this, perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel, without pressuring him into a response.
0 0 0 I am very worried about losing my job. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello - How are you today? EOS 0 0 2 Anxious. I think my boss wants to fire me. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so sorry you are worried about losing your job. I have been in your shoes before. Why do you think your boss wants to fire you? EOS 0 0 4 Thank you. I think if I am late again, I will be let go.. I have a sick child and my boss does not understand. How can I explain that I may be late to the office, but that I am a valuable employee? EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Have you explained to him your reasoning? I also once had to take care of my sick grandmother after work and had a tough time explaining it to my boss. Have you offered to stay later to make up the work?
4 0 0 Hi. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing these days? EOS 4 0 2 Not good. You? EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry to hear that. I am doing fine and hope I can cheer you up. EOS 4 0 4 Good to hear. Been feeling lonely due to this pandemic. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I totally understand it. I felt lonely too by staying home all the time. But I found we can borrow books online. A good book can really help. EOS 4 0 6 Do you mean physical or ebooks? EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Both will help. But ebooks are easier to get and you don' t need to contact anyone and anything outside your home. EOS 4 0 8 Any genres you would suggest? EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I like biographies. Stories of real people are inspiring. EOS 4 0 10 Oh ok. I was thinking about getting a dog, is that a good idea? EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a great idea! Dog is human' s best friend. I would love to have a dog myself. EOS 4 0 12 Do you have any dogs? EOS 4 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I don' t have a dog, because I like to travel. However I have taken care of other people' s dogs a lot when I am home. EOS 4 0 14 Oh ok. There is a lock down from where I live, how about you? EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] We are in similar situation. These days I only go out for grocery shopping.
3 0 0 Hello, is someone there? EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, my name is Jonathan. May I ask who I am speaking to today? EOS 3 0 2 Hi Jonathan, I' m Keri. EOS 3 1 3 [Greeting] Hi Keri. How are you today?
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi like I said a bit down. EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I did not see that, I am sorry. Do you want to talk about it? It might help. EOS 4 0 3 Ohh thank you for the offer. Proscanation is my thing i guess, and this days I am paying for it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Is it affecting your work or your home life?
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic? EOS 0 0 16 so literally, I only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. I only started a new work in September, and it' s not much( about two days a week), so I can' t comment too much about that. It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps. EOS 0 0 18 so I get nervous in general when I am at work but I do my work just the same. May not be able to work as well because I have to breathe through a mask, and some other small difficulties. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is good that you can continue to do your work the same. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you for all the positive messages so far and in understanding and sympathizing with me.. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] Is there anything else I should know about how the pandemic is affecting you?
4 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello, How are you today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m really depressed. My fiance left me yesterday. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it? EOS 4 0 3 Yes, I think that might make me feel better. I really have no one to talk to because my family and friends didn' t like him so they think this is for the best. EOS 4 1 4 [Greeting] Ok. I am happy to listen..
1 0 0 I' m having issues with my parents. You can say we are having a conflict. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] What kind of issues do you think you are having? EOS 1 0 2 well they won' t allow me to date this girl i met online.. They told she' s bad news. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today. Have you tried talking to you parents about why she is" bad news"?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello, I am looking for help in managing some depression. EOS 3 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You' ve come to a good place to start. Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed?
4 0 0 I just lost my job and am worried about paying the bills. EOS 4 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills. EOS 4 0 2 There is just too much pressure, but I have to succeed. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is hard having so much pressure but I think you will be able to soon get employed again. EOS 4 0 4 I am trying. I' ve started looking online for new positions but it is a process. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise. EOS 4 0 6 I just still am continually nervous and having a hard time coping. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes deep breaths help people calm down. Have you tried that at all? EOS 4 0 8 I haven' t but maybe that will help me stay calmer. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That can sometimes help you to regain your focus and be able to do more for yourself. EOS 4 0 10 That makes sense. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Also, job counselors may help at employment agencies to match you with potential employers. Have you tried any? EOS 4 0 12 I haven' t but that may be helpful as well. EOS 4 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I sought out help from a recruiter online who helped me to find a job as well. Have you heard of that option or tried it? EOS 4 0 14 That might help me to take the stress off myself and get someone to help in the search. EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I see that you seemed to be more relieved finding out these options. Would you say these suggestions have been helpful? EOS 4 0 16 Yes, I' m starting to feel some of the pressure taken off me. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] From what I' ve seen, people who can use some of these strategies like deep breathing and counseling they have felt some relief and could move forward better toward their goals. EOS 4 0 18 I feel a lot better. Thanks for your support. EOS 4 1 19 [Greeting] You are welcome. Can I help you with anything else?
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well?
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing. EOS 6 0 8 Yeah, people don' t know that just because my two friends go" Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two( so - called) friends? EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] definatly not... have you tried explaining your situation to them? EOS 6 0 10 No, they don' t know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID - 19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time?
1 0 0 I am so mad that I can' t see straight. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello! What is on your mind today? Oh really? Why is that? EOS 1 0 2 Well, my boyfriend has cheated so many times that I cant count them. I then meet someone nice and cheat on him once and now he breaks up with me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] being mad that your boyfriend cheated is normal. being mad when dumped is normal. don' t you think you DESERVE better than he was treating you? EOS 1 0 4 Thank you! I can see that I am talking to someone who understands. I am wondering if I should beg him back?? I really do love him. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there too. Expecially with covid, it can be hard realiing you may be alone and it may be frusterating dating someone new. if you really love someone, shouldnt they love you back? did his actions show love? EOS 1 0 6 Yeah, and we have been together since high school so it is really hard to think of ever marrying anyone else. He asked me to marry him but we never made it official or got rings. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak. i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart. EOS 1 0 8 He told me he never wants kids with me but acts like he would have them someday, somehow? I think you' re right. EOS 1 1 9 [Self-disclosure] i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter. trust me, its not worth it in the long run. maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you!
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, what brings you to seek support, today? EOS 4 0 1 I am having ongoing depression. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin?
1 0 0 hi there. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hi! Hope you are doing well. How can I help you today? EOS 1 0 2 I am having such a hard time falling asleep at night.... I toss and turn and cannot shut my mind off. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep. Hope I get it right? EOS 1 0 4 yes that' s right. my mind just races thinking about problems it seems. I am irritable and frustrated. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Is there a specific thing or task which is bothering you for long?
0 0 0 Hi. Is anyone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hi there. EOS 0 0 2 Hi I thought you were not going to show. my anxiety level just increased while I was waiting for you. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Apologies, I have had issues with my connection which should now be resolved. How can I help you today. EOS 0 0 4 I am having a panic attack. I have to come up with 100 by next week to meet my minimum charge. on my credit card. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you need to find 100, have limited time to do this and this is causing you anxiety as a result? EOS 0 0 6 yes it sure is. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, I can tell you are really worried about this and want to find a way to remove the pressure from this situation. EOS 0 0 8 yes any suggestion s. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any friends or family that you can speak to about this? If they were aware of this issue and how much it is affecting you, they may be able to support. EOS 0 0 10 They are swamped with their own bills and we live pay check to pay check. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried contacting the credit card company and explaining your situation? EOS 0 0 12 No I haven' t but if i don' t pay minimum I will get 24% interest penalty. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] that seems excessive. I had a similar situation happened myself once and what I did was transfer the balance of one of my cards onto another. EOS 0 0 14 It is the truth thats why I try to pay off in full but there was such a great deal. but thats a great idea and would give me a little extra time. Thank you. I think Ill go google credit card offers. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] do you think the credit card company has acted irresponsibly?. EOS 0 0 16 no I knew the terms when I signed up a year ago. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] even so you may be able to refer this situation for review to a financial regulator.
3 0 0 hi im sad. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Anything particular got you down? Hello. EOS 3 0 2 just life, bad year. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea bad year for everyone. The virus has really stopped us. Are you working or on layoff. EOS 3 0 4 yes it has, the political turmoil in the United States is very scary as well. I am self employed. but not working alot. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is an understatement with the politics. What do you do.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 4 1 2 [Greeting] I am good how are you. EOS 4 0 3 I am glad you are doing well, I have been struggling lately as my girlfriend that I was going to propose to broke up with me. She told me that my career path was different then hers and she just did not see it working out. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] How was your career path different? I understand how you are feeling everything will be okay. EOS 4 0 5 She had a desire to do marine biology and I wanted to pursue law enforcement as a police officer, however due to my back injury that fell through recently. She would spend most of her time doing field work, which would require her to spend time out at sea. She was working in a nursing home at the time and was not a marine biologist.. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] She did not like your career path? EOS 4 0 7 I am thinking that would be the case, however we dated for 3 years and then reconnecting about a year later which at this time was a distant relationship. She now has a boyfriend which she started date about 2 months she broke up with me. I found out that he works with her at the nursing home. I am unsure what to think, but she did say that she just didn' t see how our career paths would work out and that was that.. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right. It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after. EOS 4 0 9 I have had some friends echo that. I agree, it definitely felt like I was giving a lot through the time we dated. I have always wondered if this was a true statement, knowing her I think she probably got scared of what that entailed or just the distance. The new boyfriend was definitely a wild card, that I think has caused me to question her parting words. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don' t support your career. I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self.
3 1 0 [Question] hi how' s it going today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you? EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future? EOS 3 0 5 Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it' s true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online? EOS 3 0 7 Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression.
5 1 0 [Question] Hi there. How are you today? EOS 5 0 1 I' m good. how r u? EOS 5 1 2 [Question] I' m doing good today. What brings you on here?

Have you confronted the ex friend? EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking. EOS 5 1 6 [Question] oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it?

EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The COVID has put a lot of students is a bind. EOS 4 0 10 maybe but this is not the first time prosponding. EOS 4 1 11 [Others] No I want to study a certain field. For better understanding of the Bible. EOS 4 0 12 oh that sounds great. sometimes i feel like God is my only ally and friend. EOS 4 1 13 [Question] have you ever heard the phrase you are never to old to learn? EOS 4 0 14 Yes i have. EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Yes He truly stands by you. EOS 4 0 16 i just hope he holds me through this too, i give myself hope that he let this happen for a reason. EOS 4 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I started going to college in 94 and still going. EOS 4 0 18 wow. EOS 4 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He will see you through just keep a positive attitude. what is your field of study? EOS 4 0 20 i think i would have given up or asked God what' s his purpose with me cause i cant see it. computer engineering and information technology. EOS 4 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I know what I am after, just have to be persistent. That is a good choice of study. EOS 4 0 22 i guess so. i pray i get that too, and not give up easily. Thank you. EOS 4 1 23 [Question] Are you full time. EOS 4 0 24 yes i was. but next year am considering part time. EOS 4 1 25 [Question] What about online classes that enable you to study and work also.
7 0 0 Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well. EOS 7 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well I can help you study if you' d like? EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material... EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study!
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 The season has me down. No family around. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Are you finding time to do things you enjoy by yourself? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 3 trying to work and write but lack motivation. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are feeling some lethargy in this cold season, and feel as though you have no support from your family. EOS 0 0 5 I don' t talk to anyone. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any plans to spend Christmas with family or friends? That may help to break the cycle of feeling low? EOS 0 0 7 I live in a hotel currently. No family or friends around, especially with the virus. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What do you do for work? Are you able to get out of the hotel frequently? EOS 0 0 9 I am a writer. Witht he virus it is hard to meet anyone. i am only here until next week then I have to go to Virignia. My children r all over the country. EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I agree, it is hard to spend time with people at the moment. We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted. It would be good to have something positive to look forward to. EOS 0 0 11 I try the dating sites, but they seem to far away or impersonal. Hope things are better. Just the current season ahs me down. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I can see that. Keep in touch with your family and try to think of positive, happy times you can all have together in the future. EOS 0 0 13 No verbal communication makes it hard. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Can you call them? EOS 0 0 15 I try but the loneliness is the hard part. EOS 0 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this loneliness is really getting to you and you are struggling to see a way forwards. As you are a writer could you perhaps try to make some online friends in forums? EOS 0 0 17 It is just the lack of communication. EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear you. Perhaps you could call one of your children now? See if they' d like to catch - up? EOS 0 0 19 without any communication it makes it seem like a battle alone. My daughter is busy and 3 hours away. different time zones amke it hard. EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] Maybe schedule in a call with her for the future? I have been making time to speak with my family every Tuesday, it gives us something to look forward to each week. EOS 0 0 21 Children can only share so much. I chat with her, but the timing is off. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] What are your plans in Virginia? EOS 0 0 23 Find a place to live for awhile. I have to take care of a legal matter. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well that sounds as though it will give you something to focus on.
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Greeting] hi there. How are you? EOS 1 0 2 I am so frustrated. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] May I ask why you are feeling frustrated? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, my school was closed without warning because of COVID. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand how that could make you so frustrated, that would make me frustrated too. I am waiting to hear about my school. EOS 1 0 6 Yes I don' t even know what is going to happen with finals now. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure that whatever happens, you will do well with them. Have you thought about talking to an administrator at your school? EOS 1 0 8 I hope so. But I feel like this could have been handled better. Not yet, there is a waiting list to talk to an academic advisor. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is all the more reason to be frustrated, i commend you for having to deal with that! EOS 1 0 10 Thanks. I feel like my head is going to explode though. The remainder of the semester is going to be online. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about talking to a close friend or someone you trust about these stressors? EOS 1 0 12 Yes, I talked with my friend about it and she said don' t worry. But I can' t help it. EOS 1 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand why are you are worried though, that is a lot honestly.
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 2 I have been better. I had a rough semester in school.. EOS 6 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So things haven' t been going well at school. I think a lot of people are going through these days. EOS 6 0 4 It was alright at first but I failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade. EOS 6 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m sorry to hear that. That' s a heck of a situation to be in. Is there anything you can do? Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock? EOS 6 0 6 Yes, I already tried to appeal my grade. EOS 6 1 7 [Question] And the teacher wouldn' t budge? EOS 6 0 8 Sadly, no. I think they were too busy to really take a long time to discuss it or work with me. EOS 6 1 9 [Question] Was this for a course that was required for a major? EOS 6 0 10 It was a core class and I needed it to graduate. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ok, if you' re willing to give it one more shot, try to appeal the grade one more time. If that doesn' t work, you could try talking the class again next semester or during the summer if it' s offered. EOS 6 0 12 That does sound like a good idea. I am just so disappointed I' m not sure if it is worth it. EOS 6 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I know what you mean. I failed a Calc class once and I felt so empty inside. But I pulled myself together to take it again and passed it. I think you can do it too. EOS 6 0 14 I think you' re right. The class is tough and I know I can do it if I put my mind to it. EOS 6 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Exactly! You' ve got what it takes to make it through the difficulty, and your experiences so far will help you. EOS 6 0 16 It is very intimidating but again I agree with you. Thanks for your input. EOS 6 1 17 [Greeting] You' re welcome. In the meantime, have a little relaxation time to ease your mind. Thinking too much about the class would be stressful.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there! What would you like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 1 I am trying to be fine and you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] It may be helpful to know.. my name is Ann. I am 43 years old... and I know for myself, I enjoy talking to people when I have concerns. What is going on? EOS 0 0 3 Thank you for your concern, I am just worried. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What has you worried? I know right now... its a hard time for so many people. I have struggled with my own anxiety the past few weeks. EOS 0 0 5 Sorry about that. This is about my relationship. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah.... relationship worries can be so draining and emotionally exhausting. I can understand that. In your relationship, what has happened to create your worries? EOS 0 0 7 I trusted my spouse but eventually disappointed. She got a jot in another town and she utilize the opportunity to be sleeping around. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine how a break in trust has made you feel. I know a break in trust is always very difficult to process. EOS 0 0 9 I am planing to get married next year but things has changed now. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Oh I am sorry to hear that. Have you had a conversation with her about her actions and how they have made you feel? EOS 0 0 11 She knew pretty well how I felt. I don' t want to have anything to do with her again. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel that her actions and result can be remedied? Or is this such a fundamental break that you cannot reconcile? EOS 0 0 13 I just want to move on with my life. EOS 0 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Understandable. I would feel similar, in truth. EOS 0 0 15 I don' t that I can love her again. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Only you know whether or not if you can look to forgiving and moving forward or if this is such a fundamental break that it is not something you can mend. And if you know that this is not something you wish to move forward with her that doesn’t make you a bad person. It means you are taking care of yourself first. EOS 0 0 17 Yes, I want someone that I could trust. EOS 0 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Absolutely. Trust is to me a cornerstone of healthy relationships. So I can fully appreciate those feelings and needs. I think fundamentally as humans we want to partner with individuals who we find that we can feel safe with and trust. EOS 0 0 19 Yes, you understood my fear. EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I do think, and I am not sure how old you are, but infidelity is unfortunately not super rare. I have experienced it myself. I used some resources on even places like Reddit( Surviving Infidelity) to help me process what I had experienced and to also learn from others. EOS 0 0 21 I will check that out, thank you very much. EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also talked to a few friends who are married and had experienced infidelity. They chose to forgive each other. I learned a lot from them. It helped me to make up my own mind as to how I needed to move forward. I didn’t want to use a therapist since I do better with discussing ideas with multiple people. But ultimately you may experience a lot of ups and downs. That is also normal. It is your mind and heart processing everything. Please do not get discouraged.

EOS 2 0 3 Yeah that' s true. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] whats been the weirdest part of the pandemic for you? EOS 2 0 5 So I live with my boyfriend and my bestfriend. And I am afraid they are doing skethy stuff behind my back. It sounds crazy, and I don' t have any proof but I have this feeling. The way they talk around each other makes me nervous.

And they are jsut so much more friendly together than before we moved in. EOS 2 1 8 [Question] living together can make people more comfortable with each other. has there been something specific that has caused you to wonder about them> EOS 2 0 9 Not really specifics. It' s more of a just in general sort of thing. I know them both really really well, so I am just picking up on tiny little details. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] i hear you. have you said anything to either one of them? EOS 2 0 11 I have talked to my boyfriend, but he just tells me that it' s crazy I would think something like that. Idk... I don' t want to sound crazy and blow it out of proportion if it' s really nothing. I don' t know if there is actually something I should be worried about, or if I am thinking these crazy thoughts for other reasons. EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] having doubts about relationships is rough. do you know brene brown? EOS 2 0 13 I don' t know who that is. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she researches shame and vunerability. EOS 2 0 15 Does she do live talks or videos? Or is she more in online writing. EOS 2 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she has a great TED talk! EOS 2 0 17 Oh that' s cool! I will have to check that out. So you think maybe I am feeling this way is because I have shame or vulnerability in the relationship? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] anyway, i find her imspirational when I have doubts. no, not really it' s the doubting that is likely what' s bothering you the most - the unknown. EOS 2 0 19 Yeah.. that' s true. I think it' s a good idea to learn more about how I' m feeling before I make any rash decisions. EOS 2 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s wise. theres a great youtube video with cartoon animals where brene talks about empathy. EOS 2 0 21 Ohhh wait I think I have seen that one haha. It was shown in my class in like 9th grade. EOS 2 1 22 [Self-disclosure] things are weird for everyone right now. emotions are running high, covid is running rampant, it' s a mess and understandable that we are all stressed.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hi, I feel really sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am sorry. What is going on? EOS 4 0 3 My friends won' t hang out with me. I am alone all the time. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel like they don' t want to be around you and have nobody to talk to? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, but also just no one to hang out with. I am a loner. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] You prefer it that way?. EOS 4 0 7 No. I want to hang out with people. EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I follow you. It is hard to see people outside of usual social circles right now with the pandemic going on. Out of curiosity tell me what you like doing with others? EOS 4 0 9 I like to talk with them, listen to their stories, just hang out have a good time.. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that. I have not seem my own friends for almost a year because of COVID - 19. It felt isolated and lonely. EOS 4 0 11 What do you do to feel better? EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It has not been easy but I focused on myself. I started doing more exercise and weight lifting. I took up learning how to invest money, and I also got into the habit of reading. Basically I build myself up in body, wallet, and mind so I feel better about myself progressively. It worked well for me at least. What do you think might help you? EOS 4 0 13 That all sounds great. I think I' ll need to do more exercising. I do like reading so I' ll do that too. Thank you for the suggestions! I appreciate it. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] What would you say might be good exercise or reading goals for you?.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with this evening?. EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very depressed lately. Like a constant pressure that i don' t know exactly what it is. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I' m very sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 4 0 3 I think the days getting shorter makes it worse. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating. EOS 4 0 5 Do you have any tips on how to overcome it? EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help. I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through Instagram. I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while.. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up. I like to stay up, but when it' s time to get up i dread it. Bad cycle. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sure, that' s understandable. There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin D, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them.. EOS 4 0 9 Time is the fire in which we burn. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] Now that is intractable. EOS 4 0 11 Lol... yes it is. The pandemic heightens all our awareness of time and mortality. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes, to me, the enormity of the universe is calming to my anxiety. Being assured that I mean absolutely nothing is nice sometimes. EOS 4 0 13 And drives the civil unrest which makes me feel anxious and insecure. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] Not in a scary, better - off - dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion. I' m a flea to the universe.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello, I am looking for help in managing some depression. EOS 3 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You' ve come to a good place to start. Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 3 I am feeling resentful towards my husband for quitting his job, and my son for being the reason that he quit his job.. My son' s behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us. EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband' s loss of work and your son' s loss of his job is entirely understandable. EOS 3 0 5 I have a hard time not dwelling on the negative things going on. It' s hard to see anything positive or feel hopeful for the future. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and I understand the added stress that can cause in your household. That is a really difficult position to be in. EOS 3 0 7 My son is very defiant and argues with us about everything we try and get him to do, but he expects us to give him money for fun things that he wants to do when he isn' t willing to work or even help out around the house. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Regardless of what your husband' s actions are and your son' s, could you possibly make the time to do things to support yourself, that even momentarily would provide you with some positive feelings? EOS 3 0 9 I try to go for a run every night, that does help.. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard emotionally, so I am sorry you have to deal with your son' s behavior. EOS 3 0 11 It is hard to keep my emotions separate from what is going on with him. EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is very understandable! Setting boundaries for yourself may help. Even when it' s difficult, being clear with your son that you will not be giving him money could help. Sometimes being clear with your own expectations can help him to see what won' t be accepted from him as long as he is living in your home.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello. How can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 What should I do. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Tell me about the situation that you are facing. EOS 0 0 3 I try to find a job but there is not many. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking? EOS 0 0 5 About 6 months. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that there are a lot of job loss in the Covid time. Is your job seeking related to that? Yeah it must be very difficult. EOS 0 0 7 yes. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and I got an offer in February right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you. I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family. EOS 0 0 9 I don' t know what types of jobs that fit me. yeah, but it is still rough to get by. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] Tell me more about it if you don' t mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking? EOS 0 0 11 I worked in manufacturer. technical skill in trade school but not degree from college. EOS 0 1 12 [Others] I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position? EOS 0 0 13 I will seek for another jobs if possible but I can work on manufacturer company too. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the Covid time? EOS 0 0 15 If I can work remotely I will do it. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have been browsing job boards every now and then. There are consistently some grocery store jobs, or cashier jobs. If you don' t mind the location, I am sure you would be a good fit for these. EOS 0 0 17 The job market is very competitive. I tried but there are no responds after my interview. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I completely understand. I was looking for jobs for almost a year. I have a spreadsheet that keeps track of all the jobs I applied. Maybe only 2 or 3 percent of them replied( with an interview request, etc.) I would suggest trying applying for jobs via Linkedin, or google jobs. You can sort them by posted date. My experience is that the more recent the posting date is, the more likely they will review your application. EOS 0 0 19 Thanks, I will try more on the website you suggest. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] Previously I also registered in a few temp agencies that would place me in companies with the intension of only keeping in on board for a few months/ weeks. They can be a good gap filler as well. EOS 0 0 21 Do they charge you when you get a job? EOS 0 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] I hope I can be more helpful. I really sympathize with your situation. They would just terminate me after they have found a permanent employee on an ongoing basis. In rare situations, they would hire" temp - to - hire" with the expectation of hiring temp workers. EOS 0 0 23 Thank you, there are no many availability of what I can do and it is just out of control from nowhere. EOS 0 1 24 [Greeting] Thank you for reaching out. It really shows that you care and you are working towards the goal. I hope you succeed.
0 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I am good, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m doing well, but it could have been better. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] What seems to be bothering you tonight? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, my boy friend of 3 years has refused to take our relationship to the next level and I' m kind of getting tired, I don' t want to play games anymore. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don' t feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I' m a little bummed because my friend is not only a junkie but he got arrested last week. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ouch! Your friend got arrested for drugs last week? EOS 3 0 3 He got arrested for stealing to fund his addiction. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I had a neighbor who was doing meth, and he got arrested, and that actually saved his life. He had to get sober and look at what he was doing. There is a hard line between helping a friend who is addicted and actually enabling them. Have you ever heard of this? EOS 3 0 5 Sadly my friend has been arrested a few times, spent time in prison, and is fully locked in his lifestyle. He' s such a great person, very funny, nice, but he is lost. EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It can be very hard to watch a loved one destroy their lives. Has anyone every discussed an intervention? EOS 3 0 7 He has alienated all of his friends, including me. I was the last one holding on. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] My husband and I actually have worked with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. We are retired now, but still volunteer. Sometimes we have to let go of our loved ones - they have to hit rock bottom. Very hard to do, but unless they see their behavior as destructive, they don' t want to change. EOS 3 0 9 I agree, I' m afraid that' s what I have to do. Another one of our mutual friends passed away recently to an overdose. I don' t want to lose another friend. EOS 3 1 10 [Others] Have you seen the serenity prayer? Knowing what to do, what not to do and accepting life really is a great thing to ask God for. We can' t change others. Yet you have to find a way to have peace. EOS 3 0 11 Yes. I know I have to let go. I' ve punished myself trying to stay in his life. EOS 3 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] It' s very hard to lose friends to addictions. It' s epidemic in our society now. However, you can pray for them and look for ways to keep your life on track so you don' t get lost focusing on them and not where you want to go. EOS 3 0 13 all drugs are bad, but meth is a truly evil drug. It' s just rotting his soul and body. He believes he can' t stop and you' re right, letting go and just sending prayers is all i can really do now. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] very evil, I agree, I like to write out a list of things I can do to distract myself from overly being concerned, if that makes sense. Like I take time to think about them and pray for them, then I have to move on with my life, so a list helps me think of where I want to go and how to get there. Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol. My husband just got me a daytimer, and I write my goals in that for the new year, and I try to check it every day and try to focus on moving forward, because life has a way of throwing us curveballs like this, and we can' t get stuck in them. EOS 3 0 15 That' s a good idea. I don' t have many friends left, close friends that is, and this guy is my best friend of 20 years. We were in a touring rock band together. He' s my last close friend. EOS 3 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to lose friends that we have had for years. Maybe you can write that on your list - - perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class, join a gym, take a dance class, volunteer at church, something like that. That way you open up yourself to make new friends. I have had to walk away from many unhealthy relationships over the years, it isn' t easy, but it' s part of maturing in life.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 0 0 2 Just feeling sad. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad? EOS 0 0 4 Not being able to leave the house with Covid. plus my hours were cut at work. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut. What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time? EOS 0 0 6 Yes it sucks. I live alone now so there really hard sometimes. I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos. Nothing productive. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it' s not the same as face to face.
1 1 0 [Question] hi. how can i help you? EOS 1 0 1 hi. i am really angry. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] are you saying that you are angry now? what happened dear? EOS 1 0 3 really angry at my friend. EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] can you tell me what happened so that i can understand? EOS 1 0 5 i told him a secret about my self in private and he played a stupid pranks that reveals it to other people i don' t like. EOS 1 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s ok dear. did you asked him why he did that? EOS 1 0 7 he said he was drunk. EOS 1 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] just remember, yesterday is gone. there is really nothing you can do about the situation. you better keep your distance from that particular person. EOS 1 0 9 ok. and i already keep my distance from him. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] learn from your mistake and don' t do it again dear. EOS 1 0 11 yes i won' t. funny thing is he didn' t remember what he did that night. EOS 1 1 12 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah. we can' t control others. right? EOS 1 0 13 absolutely. EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes. it totally depends on how mature the person is. just forgive him and keep in mind for next time whether you should share something with him or not. EOS 1 0 15 i am definitely sharing my secret anyone ever again. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes. let it go and don' t confuse it again. trust me. you became stronger by this. EOS 1 0 17 i hope so. EOS 1 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] yes. don' t think much and sleep soon dear. EOS 1 0 19 i will sleep soon. it' s nice getting the feeling out. EOS 1 1 20 [Greeting] i am happy to hear this dear. EOS 1 0 21 thanks for the chat. EOS 1 1 22 [Greeting] welcome dear.
3 0 0 I was reallly worried in this suitation. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi, i' m sean, hows your day going. EOS 3 0 2 Was not so good. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Tell me about the situation. EOS 3 0 4 How was your day. EOS 3 1 5 [Others] Boring. EOS 3 0 6 It really very stress full and depressed situation. Why your day is boring. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Don' t worry about my day, i' m 34 and retired i do this to help people, tell me about your situation. EOS 3 0 8 My suitaion is really very sad and depressed. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I was a homeless drug addicted junkie for over 10 years. Tell me how yours is worse sweety. Tell me why you are so sad and depressed. EOS 3 0 10 I had breakup with my partner, it was really very horrible to me to overcome. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Was he abusive, tell me more. EOS 3 0 12 I tried a lot but i couldnt forget him at all. He was not abusive at all. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] So what was the problem? Tell me more. I can' t help you if you don' t talk to me darling'
4 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling really sad and lonely right now. My boyfriend and I broke up and it was me who wanted it but now I regret breaking up and he doesn' t want me back. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, I can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it' s too late. EOS 4 0 3 That is exactly it. I broke up with him because I liked another person but then quickly realized that I made a mistake and it' s too late. I want him back should I start calling and going to his house to beg? EOS 4 1 4 [Question] nobody knows him better than you do, right now I do not think he is in a good place either since it wasn' t his choice to end it, how do you think he would react if you started pressuring him?. EOS 4 0 5 I haven' t really thought of that yet. He has a pretty short temper actually. I know he is really mad at me so I think he might want to yell at me and get his anger out before he could start being nice to me again. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this, perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel, without pressuring him into a response. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah, that' s true. I have been secretly watching his social media and he has girls asking him out and I don' t want to let them get to him before I can get him back. I want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] you can always ask him calmly if he would like to talk, so you both have a chance to express your feelings in a safe way, with no yelling or arguing, do you think that' s something he would do? EOS 4 0 9 I can try that, I think he might be responsive at first if I dont set him off. All of his friends hate me so I have nobody on my side right now. Should I try to get his friends to like me again? Is that an way I could use to get him to want me again? EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] nobody likes to see that one' s friend is sad because of someone else, I think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back. EOS 4 0 11 I can understand what you mean. I need to think this through. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] what made you like someone else in the first place? EOS 4 0 13 Well, we are in a small town and he was popular and the cutest guy in our town. I liked being with someone so popular. He wasn' t always nice to me and is why I wanted to be with someone else for a short time. He used to leave me at parties and go off with his friends sometimes. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] was it a common thing that he didn' t give you the attention you wanted? EOS 4 0 15 My friends always said that I could do better and that he didn' t deserve me. He gave me statis in our town and everyone wanted to be his girlfriend so I think I liked the attention, yes. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] were you happy with him or were you happy that you were with the popular guy? EOS 4 0 17 I really liked being with the popular guy who everyone looked up to. My parents don' t like him at all and have wanted us to break up the whole time we were together. EOS 4 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] it sounds to me like you liked the title more than the feeling of being with him, reflecting on your time together, would you do that again? EOS 4 0 19 I have never thought of it this way. You are making a lot of good points that I never thought of before. When I think about him I miss the way I felt in terms of being popular. I don' t really miss him as a person. EOS 4 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] popularity in my opinion, it' s just an opinion( I hope I make sense) but think about how you' d like to be treated and how you want to feel when you are with someone, because at the end of the day it' s your feelings and your happiness, I wish you the best of luck.
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! How are you today? EOS 3 0 2 Ok I guess. I do not know how to tell my husband that I am lonely and I want out of the marriage. EOS 3 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, that sure is a heavy subject and a heavy thing to be on your mind. EOS 3 0 4 He is not one you can talk to he usually just brushes things off. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have tried to discuss your loneliness with your husband before?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Nice to meet you Jim, I am doing well. Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 3 I really appreciate your time Yes. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What is on your mind? EOS 0 0 5 I have been retired for over 2 years and would like to return to the workforce, part - ti me. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are thinking of going back to work? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, It would help us greatly. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have the right idea already. EOS 0 0 9 There are plenty of jobs and not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will find something suitable if you keep trying. EOS 0 0 11 Thanks What do you mean? Yeah, I know this but I don' t feel it.. EOS 0 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] You may feel a little apprehensive to get started. EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, I am. I know I can do it. Not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have been in the same position before and came out successful in the end. EOS 0 0 15 Wow, That' s great. How did you start?. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I just decided.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hi. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] how are you?
0 0 0 Hello, I' m having a terrible day. My name is Sean and I work for a large distribution company. EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] hi! i' m sorry to hear that. how is your work going so far. EOS 0 0 2 The problem with a job like Amazon or Kehe distribution is the quotas. The pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID? EOS 0 0 4 no COVID 19 has nothing to do with any of this work. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how anxious you are right now. Can you give me some more info on your job. EOS 0 0 6 well when there are 50 million americans out of work right it' s a bit scary. i' m a forklift operator..... I move pallets from one area of the warehouse to another but i. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i totally understand how nerve wrecking this is, but trust me you guys being front - line workers are our real heros. EOS 0 0 8 am based on a quota. I am suppose to be able to move 10 pallets per hour. that' s almost impossible as it is a 1 million square foot warehouse. If i get a pallet on the west side and have to move it to the east side that takes 7 - 10 minutes even if your going dangerously fast. doesn' t feel like it to me. EOS 0 1 9 [Question] did you try discussing your concerns with your Team Lead/ Warehouse Supervisor of your group. EOS 0 0 10 I feel like a replaceable cog in a giant machine that doesn' t give two shits whether I show up for work or not despite having over five years experience with over 12 forklifts..... Yes and they always say the same thing. You need to get your numbers up but it' s a catch 22 you can' t possibly safely get your numbers up and accomplish your quotas. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are doing your best and are working really hard. EOS 0 0 12 so. EOS 0 1 13 [Question] just a thought - did you try changing roles within the warehouse to a different position? or try checking with the manager regarding this. you have 5 years exp, i' m sure you deserve a better role and pay. EOS 0 0 14 I am a felon and I have a bachelores degree in business management. I am desperately trying to get out of the quota based work areas. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] i understand, but when i had a slight trouble with my job, talking to my manager helped me a lot. also, your manager is your best point of contact for a great reference. EOS 0 0 16 Do you know how incredibly hard it is to serve your time in jail for 3 years and get out and can' t find a job except scrubbing floors or cleaning shit or servinge tables. my manager doesn' t give a shit. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] thats hard,.. but you can do it.
4 0 0 hi. hello!!??!!?? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] hello. EOS 4 0 2 hi. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I apologize I was having a sneezing fit! What is on your mind today? EOS 4 0 4 oh no. i hope its not covid!. my friends aunt is in the hospital with double pneumonia from covid. EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] No, cats and out of claritin. oh my, that is horrible! EOS 4 0 6 i hear ya. just bought some claritin this morning for allergies. I agree. at least she is responding to the treatments in the hospital. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That' s great to hear she is responding! EOS 4 0 8 I was happy to hear it too. I' ve been extra careful not to get it cuz of my parents. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] ah, are they elderly or have a weakened immune system? EOS 4 0 10 elderly. dads doctor told me not to meet friends in person cuz i could pass it onto him. EOS 4 1 11 [Others] gotcha. you must live with them to help them out! EOS 4 0 12 i sure do. thing is people my age are getting very sick with it too. and some elderly are not. so i could be helping myself more than my dad. EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] mine are in another state so i don' t have to worry about my behavior. you are right though, anyone can get it... i should probably be more careful myself.

EOS 4 1 19 [Others] i am hoping it all ends soon... i miss how things used to be. EOS 4 0 20 me too. i feel like im living in a bubble lol.

EOS 4 0 22 I hear ya. We just have to hope for the best. I already made thanksgiving meal yesterday for my dad and dog. They both slept after eating turkey lol. yeah for real lol tons of bubbles in bubble wrap. EOS 4 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] very true.. just keep on keeping on!:) EOS 4 0 24 exactly. ive been shopping since covid. its very theraputic actually. cheaper than a shrink lol. EOS 4 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes.... but my recycling pile has gottene out of hand with amazon boxes. oops lol.
0 1 0 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] hi. EOS 0 0 1 Online learning is not seems easy, Seems I am going to fail this year. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] chill my dear friend, nothing of that sort will happen. EOS 0 0 3 In - class learning was way better and I learned a lot but now its so confusing. EOS 0 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] everything you need is a little peace of mind, patience and little more effort. EOS 0 0 5 Even working with online tools is hard. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] i understand, but just think everyone else like us are doing the same and facing the same difficulties. EOS 0 0 7 I know but what is I loose a whole year in academic,. EOS 0 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Think positive my dear friend. Shake all your negatives.
4 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling really sad and lonely right now. My boyfriend and I broke up and it was me who wanted it but now I regret breaking up and he doesn' t want me back. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, I can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it' s too late. EOS 4 0 3 That is exactly it. I broke up with him because I liked another person but then quickly realized that I made a mistake and it' s too late. I want him back should I start calling and going to his house to beg? EOS 4 1 4 [Question] nobody knows him better than you do, right now I do not think he is in a good place either since it wasn' t his choice to end it, how do you think he would react if you started pressuring him?. EOS 4 0 5 I haven' t really thought of that yet. He has a pretty short temper actually. I know he is really mad at me so I think he might want to yell at me and get his anger out before he could start being nice to me again. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this, perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel, without pressuring him into a response. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah, that' s true. I have been secretly watching his social media and he has girls asking him out and I don' t want to let them get to him before I can get him back. I want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] you can always ask him calmly if he would like to talk, so you both have a chance to express your feelings in a safe way, with no yelling or arguing, do you think that' s something he would do? EOS 4 0 9 I can try that, I think he might be responsive at first if I dont set him off. All of his friends hate me so I have nobody on my side right now. Should I try to get his friends to like me again? Is that an way I could use to get him to want me again? EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] nobody likes to see that one' s friend is sad because of someone else, I think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back. EOS 4 0 11 I can understand what you mean. I need to think this through. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] what made you like someone else in the first place?
3 0 0 hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello. I need some help. I have been depressed. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you doing today? Do have anything on your mind? Oh i see, well we can talk about that if you like. Has anything happened recently to make you feel this way? EOS 4 0 3 I am not doing very well. Very depressed with having to stay home because of the COVID - 19/ I will appreciate anything you can do to help me. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like social isolation is really weighing on you... EOS 4 0 5 Yes, it sure is. I feel so alone. I feel it will help to talk to an outsider. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Human being are social creatures by nature so please understand that the feelings that you are having are absolutely normal. So dont judge yourself or feel as if something is wrong with YOU. EOS 4 0 7 Sometimes it helps to a stranger - most of my friends feel as I do. I am sure you are right - I thank you for your support.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You mentioned your friends feel the same way you do... Have you guys thought about making trying to do a zoom party? EOS 4 0 9 No, we haven' t talked about that, but that is a great idea. I will talk to them to see how they feel about doing this. Thank you. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have a group of sister friends and we threw a zoom party. we scheduled it out and we decorated our own spaces and we made a spotify playlist that everyone contributed a song to and basically just had a video party. Do you think your frinds may like to try that with you? EOS 4 0 11 I feel somewhat better just thin. I feel a little better now. I look forward to talking with my friends about doing Zoom. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Be creative! Get silly! most important have fun! this is a hard year but its still a chance to make happy memories. Is there anything else on your mind?
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic? EOS 0 0 16 so literally, I only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. I only started a new work in September, and it' s not much( about two days a week), so I can' t comment too much about that. It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps. EOS 0 0 18 so I get nervous in general when I am at work but I do my work just the same. May not be able to work as well because I have to breathe through a mask, and some other small difficulties. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is good that you can continue to do your work the same. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you for all the positive messages so far and in understanding and sympathizing with me.. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] Is there anything else I should know about how the pandemic is affecting you? EOS 0 0 22 pretty much. If anything, it' s my academic life at home that has changed not so well.. EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Are you a student? EOS 0 0 24 yes, I take online courses and I tend to procrastinate a lot more and get distracted as I find myself more and more at home. Just getting carried away and now have impending deadlines.. I can get through it but it has had a toll on my productivity.. I was just taking my sweet time with it and that wasn' t good. EOS 0 1 25 [Self-disclosure] I am also a student and am not motivated to do school work at home, so I completely understand. I am sure you are successful at school! Having a planner may keep you organized and on - task. Dedicating a certain time frame and area for school work might help, as well.. EOS 0 0 26 Because prior to the pandemic, I was pretty regimented with set schedules and can clear my mind with work - outs and going to the gym and movies, but now it' s not that simple.. EOS 0 1 27 [Question] Is there anything else I can help you with? EOS 0 0 28 Thank you and I hope your schooling goes well also.. EOS 0 1 29 [Greeting] Thank you, you too! EOS 0 0 30 yeah I like your idea of dedicating the time. I find that I am slacking off and being disorganized in areas like time management. So yes I have to improve on that.. I suppose you have been doing your schooling relatively better in your situation?. I hope you do anyhow. EOS 0 1 31 [Question] Great ideas! Is there anything else I can help you with?

EOS 4 0 3 I am really sad and stressed up knowing that I am soon losing my job due to the effects of corona virus.

EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, don' t worry friend, EOS 4 0 5 Are there any ways you know that could help me convince my boss that that it is not the right time to cut down on manpower?

EOS 4 0 7 Incase i lose the job, are there ways that can help me stay out of stress of losing the job? I am worried that losing a job may cause me a lot of harm since my bills depend on my current job.

EOS 4 0 9 I am really worried that getting another job during this season of corona is not easy, that is the stress that is almost killing me. Sure I do believe myself.

EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i am not sure. what' s your occupation? EOS 4 0 13 Its ok my friend I believe that God will provide. I am an architect.

3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 2 Feeling depressed as usual. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 4 Everything. Life. It' s awful. How many years do you really need to stop enjoying this place. Ya know what I mean. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand, but just to make sure I know what is going on fully, you are depressed in general and don' t know how to get through it.. EOS 3 0 6 I would say that is fairly accurate. Often times, I wish an asteroid would come down and begin the apocolypse.. Something to break up the routine. Don' t you find life utterly boring and repetitive?. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Just from these few messages, I can tell you are extremely upset about this.. I have had problems in the past with depression as well, I used to have severe anxiety as well.. EOS 3 0 8 Sorry to hear that. Anxiety and depression are dual bladed sword of badness. Really bad mixture. I never struggled too much with anxiety.. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It was tough. Have you thought about consulting a psychological professional to help with this issue? I did when I was going through my depression and it really helped.. EOS 3 0 10 NO! I would never do that. I' m already on anti depressants. That didn' t help at all.. I just don' t understand why people like life enough to make more people! It is madness! EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I didn' t like the meds that they gave me either, however I felt that talking to someone helped me a great deal.. EOS 3 0 12 Well, I' m glad it helped you. I' m not just saying that. Being depressed is awful.. What did it do for you? How so? EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] It was good to be able to talk to an objective third party about what was going on. It allowed me to get my feelings out without the threat of being judges or harrassed.. EOS 3 0 14 I understand. Well, I appreciate your time and advice. I just don' t feel like you and I are understanding each other very well, though. Anyway, you made your bonus. I appreciate you trying to help me, though. We got to talk for another 4 minutes though. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to focus on more of your hobbies in order to get your mind off of things?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 3 0 2 well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. My life is done now. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband.
0 0 0 Good afternoon. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Good afternoon. how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I am not good at all. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] oh no. I am sorry, what happened? EOS 0 0 4 This pandemic is causing too much of trouble for me. Firstly pay cut and now about to layoff. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. This pandemic terrible. sorry to hear that. EOS 0 0 6 My company don' t want to consider any body at all. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s pretty tough. You' re like the 3rd person today who have been going through this,
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all. EOS 0 0 45 Also being far away from him sucks. EOS 0 1 46 [Question] Are you guys FaceTiming or communicating at all other than by texts? EOS 0 0 47 You are being very helpful by the way thank you. We aren' t FaceTiming. I just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it.. EOS 0 1 48 [Greeting] I' m trying my best, thank you for the input! Upset about leaving the apartment? Or was there something else that happened that weekend? EOS 0 0 49 Just leaving him. EOS 0 1 50 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you guys thought about scheduling date nights through FaceTime? EOS 0 0 51 I think he would but he hasn' t been feeling really good about his appearance lately. I asked and that' s what he told me. EOS 0 1 52 [Self-disclosure] I understand that completely, I can relate a lot. EOS 0 0 53 Same. EOS 0 1 54 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If it makes any difference, my partner and I have been doing date nights where we would dress up, put make up on and do our hair and everything as if we were going to the restaurant, and even if it is through Facetime or whenever we see each other in real life, it helps not only with our own self - esteem but also our relationship. EOS 0 0 55 That is very cute. EOS 0 1 56 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could open the discussion with your boyfriend, tell him that you have a date planned over Facetime and you want him to order his favorite dinner, take a shower, do his hair and dress up real nice.
0 0 0 hey. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m good, busy. I need another job to pay more bills. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having a difficult time with your finances. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 yes somewhat. i can pay it off within 2 - 3 years without a second job. id like to pay it off faster though. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure it will take dedication and hard work, but I bet you can do it! EOS 0 0 6 I think so. Im doing mturk for a second job right now. it helps some. i don' t know about getting another job. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been in your shoes and also feel that' s a good way to add a little extra income. It can really add up if left to built and used towards a specific goal. EOS 0 0 8 I agree 100%. Been spending it on new clothes and toiletries lately to stock up for the covid shutdown. the extra money helps alot. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It definitely can help. Perhaps you could have a separate way of using some of the money to go towards some of the other bills you would like to pay off? Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns. EOS 0 0 10 i currently do that. it' s hard to have the patience to pay it off. i hate having debt hanging over my head. i like to have nice things though and they cost money. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Yes, and I have found this can be a good way to provide for the extra luxuries we like, without taking away from money that' s used towards household bills. EOS 0 0 12 absolutely. i make sure all of my household bills are paid every month. i think it will get better once these debts are paid off. i needed a lot of new things at once since the old had worn out. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to use some of the scripts that can be added that allows you to catch hits that are hard to get on Mturk? They can be very helpful. Also, there are forums that have all kinds of useful information for workers. EOS 0 0 14 no i haven' t tried those yet. do i have to pay for those scripts? EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You might find it useful to do a little research and add them as extensions to Chrome or whatever browser you use. They are free and pretty simple to use. EOS 0 0 16 So I could make more money on mturk than I am now by using those? EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] They have helped me in being able to get a bit more extra income. The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It' s easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over. The forums can a large amount of help too. Perhaps try MTS. They also can show exactly how much you end up making per hour, filter by monetary amount of hits, etc.
4 0 0 I' m feeling really sad, I thought it was going somewhere. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What do you mean you thought it was going somewhere? Are you okay? EOS 4 0 2 yes I' m okay, I' m so sad. five years, I gave my heart to this girl. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Did you guys break up recently? EOS 4 0 4 yes she broke my heart last night, what did I do wrong? EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong. You shouldn' t blame yourself. EOS 4 0 6 but I gave her my all. I feel so betrayed. I' m feeling so sad I want to jump over a bridge. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there, a few years before I was married, my boyfriend broke up with me. We had some space, and then were able to become friends again. And you know what? We ended up getting back together and getting married. EOS 4 0 8 you think it' s my fault? 5 years man, 5 years and just like that she broke my heart. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t give up, you never know what the future holds. I don' t know your particular situation, but it takes two to make relationships work. I don' t think you should blame yourself. EOS 4 0 10 thank you, will try to keep my head up. you think she cheated on me? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] I don' t know what happened. Is that what you think happened? EOS 4 0 12 well I don' t know. why end so abruptly. EOS 4 1 13 [Question] What did she say when you broke up?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello. How can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 What should I do. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Tell me about the situation that you are facing. EOS 0 0 3 I try to find a job but there is not many. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking? EOS 0 0 5 About 6 months. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that there are a lot of job loss in the Covid time. Is your job seeking related to that? Yeah it must be very difficult. EOS 0 0 7 yes. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and I got an offer in February right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you. I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family. EOS 0 0 9 I don' t know what types of jobs that fit me. yeah, but it is still rough to get by. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] Tell me more about it if you don' t mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking? EOS 0 0 11 I worked in manufacturer. technical skill in trade school but not degree from college. EOS 0 1 12 [Others] I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position? EOS 0 0 13 I will seek for another jobs if possible but I can work on manufacturer company too. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the Covid time? EOS 0 0 15 If I can work remotely I will do it. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have been browsing job boards every now and then. There are consistently some grocery store jobs, or cashier jobs. If you don' t mind the location, I am sure you would be a good fit for these. EOS 0 0 17 The job market is very competitive. I tried but there are no responds after my interview. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I completely understand. I was looking for jobs for almost a year. I have a spreadsheet that keeps track of all the jobs I applied. Maybe only 2 or 3 percent of them replied( with an interview request, etc.) I would suggest trying applying for jobs via Linkedin, or google jobs. You can sort them by posted date. My experience is that the more recent the posting date is, the more likely they will review your application. EOS 0 0 19 Thanks, I will try more on the website you suggest. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] Previously I also registered in a few temp agencies that would place me in companies with the intension of only keeping in on board for a few months/ weeks. They can be a good gap filler as well.
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Greeting] hi there. How are you? EOS 1 0 2 I am so frustrated. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] May I ask why you are feeling frustrated? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, my school was closed without warning because of COVID. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand how that could make you so frustrated, that would make me frustrated too. I am waiting to hear about my school. EOS 1 0 6 Yes I don' t even know what is going to happen with finals now. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure that whatever happens, you will do well with them. Have you thought about talking to an administrator at your school? EOS 1 0 8 I hope so. But I feel like this could have been handled better. Not yet, there is a waiting list to talk to an academic advisor. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is all the more reason to be frustrated, i commend you for having to deal with that! EOS 1 0 10 Thanks. I feel like my head is going to explode though. The remainder of the semester is going to be online. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about talking to a close friend or someone you trust about these stressors? EOS 1 0 12 Yes, I talked with my friend about it and she said don' t worry. But I can' t help it. EOS 1 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand why are you are worried though, that is a lot honestly. EOS 1 0 14 I was doing so well in my classes too. Very close to graduating. EOS 1 1 15 [Question] Do you think that your grades will go down with the switch to online?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello, I am looking for help in managing some depression. EOS 3 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You' ve come to a good place to start. Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 3 I am feeling resentful towards my husband for quitting his job, and my son for being the reason that he quit his job.. My son' s behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us. EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband' s loss of work and your son' s loss of his job is entirely understandable. EOS 3 0 5 I have a hard time not dwelling on the negative things going on. It' s hard to see anything positive or feel hopeful for the future. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and I understand the added stress that can cause in your household. That is a really difficult position to be in. EOS 3 0 7 My son is very defiant and argues with us about everything we try and get him to do, but he expects us to give him money for fun things that he wants to do when he isn' t willing to work or even help out around the house. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Regardless of what your husband' s actions are and your son' s, could you possibly make the time to do things to support yourself, that even momentarily would provide you with some positive feelings? EOS 3 0 9 I try to go for a run every night, that does help.. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard emotionally, so I am sorry you have to deal with your son' s behavior. EOS 3 0 11 It is hard to keep my emotions separate from what is going on with him. EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is very understandable! Setting boundaries for yourself may help. Even when it' s difficult, being clear with your son that you will not be giving him money could help. Sometimes being clear with your own expectations can help him to see what won' t be accepted from him as long as he is living in your home. EOS 3 0 13 Yes, I could do better at that. I want him to have fun and do things with friends, but I want him to be willing to work for what he wants, too.. I do struggle with expectations. I want him to be someone that he is not willing to be, I need to let go of that and just let him be himself and not base my emotions on his choices. EOS 3 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand that. Especially when it comes to people we are close to, it can be hard to separate our expectations from theirs. EOS 3 0 15 I feel guilty sometimes taking time to do things that I like and that are away from my family. I can see that I need to do that more, though. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I' ve had to learn this lesson many times with my own children. It' s difficult, but ultimately will give you some relief from your resentment.
1 0 0 I' m qualified for a promotion but my boss is refusing to promote me based on biased feedback he has received from someone else. EOS 1 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn' t willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day, how are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 Not too well. I have been depessed because of our state shut down and today an old friend from unior high school passed. EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that. I absolutely understand, it' s been hard on most people having to deal with the current state of affairs and losing people.. Do you think things will improve? EOS 3 0 3 Thank you. I know we are all in the same predicament.. I think things will improve, but not for a year or more.. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I agree. I lost a teacher some time ago and I' ve been thinking a lot about when things might improve. A year seems plausible. Since it' s so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up? EOS 3 0 5 A year is a long time when y. A year is a long time when you are 76 years old. I just want to enjoy the rest of our lives - my husband and me - and travel until we can' t enjoy it any longer. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that. It is really tough being restricted to not travelling. I call my parents( around your age) about once a week. EOS 3 0 7 Thank you so much for your support. It is tough and there is nothing to do. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have family you can talk to? Have you considered volunteering? I ask because my neighbor bakes for the local food bank and it helps her. EOS 3 0 9 Yes, I do, but I can' t talk to my son in Florida because he lost his job and havng tough time. I don' t feel like I should enjoy my life when he is suffering. We may need to help him financially. I use to volunteer at a nursing home, but I am afraid to now with the virus. EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is reasonable. And it sounds like you are doing all you can. Could you teach from home online and keep yourself safe? Or perhaps provide your son financial support? EOS 3 0 11 I am trying to do what I can for my son and also to help so I don' t get too down and depressed. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are doing everything you can. Some things are just beyond our control. And we are all struggling, so please know you are not alone in your feelings. EOS 3 0 13 Thank you - that makes me feel some better. You are right and I learned more than ever that some things I con' t control. Yes, we are all struggling and trying to get this this pandemic. I am sorry that we are all going through this and pray it will get over soon. EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] I couldn' t agree more. We will get through this with each others help.

EOS 4 1 11 [Others] No I want to study a certain field. For better understanding of the Bible. EOS 4 0 12 oh that sounds great. sometimes i feel like God is my only ally and friend. EOS 4 1 13 [Question] have you ever heard the phrase you are never to old to learn? EOS 4 0 14 Yes i have. EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Yes He truly stands by you. EOS 4 0 16 i just hope he holds me through this too, i give myself hope that he let this happen for a reason. EOS 4 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I started going to college in 94 and still going. EOS 4 0 18 wow. EOS 4 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He will see you through just keep a positive attitude. what is your field of study? EOS 4 0 20 i think i would have given up or asked God what' s his purpose with me cause i cant see it. computer engineering and information technology. EOS 4 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I know what I am after, just have to be persistent. That is a good choice of study. EOS 4 0 22 i guess so. i pray i get that too, and not give up easily. Thank you. EOS 4 1 23 [Question] Are you full time. EOS 4 0 24 yes i was. but next year am considering part time. EOS 4 1 25 [Question] What about online classes that enable you to study and work also. EOS 4 0 26 pick up work. i had a scholarship but it got cancelled when my grades dropped a bit. EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are classes you can take that can fit your schedule. EOS 4 0 28 that' s the plan next year. I have 2 more years to go. EOS 4 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But don' t give up what you started. Take classes now. See what you need and take the classes that will enable you to keep gpoing. EOS 4 0 30 i wont though two years seem like forever right now. Actually started saving up now for school next year. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Just never give up. Two years will go by quickly if you keep attending. Look for grants that will assist you.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 im feeling pretty sad today. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 4 0 3 its about me and my friend got fight for misunderstanding. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like your feelings are hurt over a misunderstanding you had with a friend is this correct? EOS 4 0 5 yeah thats correct. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] I see i am sorry that it has you feeling down, did you try to talk with your friend to see if you could resolve your feelings? EOS 4 0 7 no he was not responding to me. he just avoiding me. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe you could send him a message on social media and let him know the argument has your feelings hurt and you would like to try to talk about it when he has time. EOS 4 0 9 thanks but he totally avoiding me he just blocked me and he ignore me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] how long have you been friends with him? EOS 4 0 11 for 5 years. but he thinks that i have affair with his girlfriend. EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] oh yea that can make things difficult, but i think if you keep reaching out you may could talk this over. Did you try to explain to him that his thoughts were not true? EOS 4 0 13 yeah but how should i start because he misjudged me and his girlfriend its a sensitive issue. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would start off by telling him that you were sorry that he had those thoughts but there is no truth to it and the fact that he does not trust you enough to know that is hurtful to you and her. If that does not work then you might need to take some time to reflect and figure out if that is a friendship worth trying to save, you may find yourself better off without a friend who shows no trust in you. EOS 4 0 15 please give me some suggegtion that what should i do now. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would continue trying to reach out to him and until you can get in touch with him maybe find some thing to do to occupy your mind as to where it does not bother you so much. do you have any hobbies? EOS 4 0 17 yeah i like to play football. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe go play some football to get your mind off of it.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 I am fine thank you. How are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am very well. Do you have any problems you' d like to discuss with me? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I am having trouble figuring out how to handel a situation with a friend. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah, can you give me a few more details? I am sure I will be able to help/ EOS 0 0 5 Her husband was justshot and kiled over a drug deal. He was high on drugs at the time. My dayghter and his daughter are good friends and we carpool with them every day. He was often the driver not my friend. Was he high when he was driving my daughter arround? Did my friend know he was on drugs? EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow that is a tough one - I can see why you would be concerned about it. At least, though, you can be assured that she is safe and is never going to come to any harm as a result of his driving now. EOS 0 0 7 Agreed but it is hard to not be suspicious that the mom knew something about hi actions. Yet I feel horrible that she lost her husband. EOS 0 1 8 [Others] I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it:( EOS 0 0 9 I know. I am trying to be supportive and help her with her kids but a part of me is still anxious that she may have played me. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] People can hold values that to other people seem strange. She might not have considered it wrong to be driving on drugs, even though it is. EOS 0 0 11 Very true. I really never even considered that! EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would not make it acceptable though! EOS 0 0 13 No, absolutely not! But I never looked at it that way. EOS 0 1 14 [Others] At least you can feel relieved that your daughter is safe now:) EOS 0 0 15 Yes. I am very relieved. He was recently in a car accident before he died. Luckily no one was hurt and the girls were not in the car! He totaled his brand new truck though. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think the best you can do right now is just be there for your friend when she wants to talk. EOS 0 0 17 Definitely trying to be! EOS 0 1 18 [Question] Is she able to support herself financially? EOS 0 0 19 Yes she received payouts from several large life insurance policies so they are safe financially. Just a mess emotionally. EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe it can be a good opportunity for her to change her lifestyle and get off the drugs. On that note, I hope I have been able to give you some reassurance and thanks for talking!
6 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there! How may I support you? EOS 6 0 2 Well, I' m really upset with my friends. EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I am so sorry to hear that. Did something happen? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, they aren' t taking COVID seriously. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Much better than normal, even though the stock market is down. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Are you an investor? EOS 0 0 3 I am a student that tries to put as much money into as possible. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand the struggle with being at that stage in life. Has this affected you negatively? EOS 0 0 5 No the stock market really doesn' t cause stress for me, mostly just small things that I think my brain overreacts to. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] What sorts of things? EOS 0 0 7 Kind of a variety of things. I typically get bad anxiety after a night of going out. So I am trying to cut out drinking. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety? Do you suffer from anxiety when you do not drink ever? EOS 0 0 9 Sometimes but I think the root from them comes from when I do something while I' m drinking. Not that I do anything bad, but I just don' t like not remembering things. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] So you would say that you drink to the point of blacking out? Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you' ve had a reasonable amount of alcohol? EOS 0 0 11 I used to black out a lot, but I have tried to control it by cutting the former amount of drinks I consumed in half, if I do choose to go out. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I have drank to the point of blacking out several times in my life mostly when I was younger and I found that it either came from a certain type of alcohol or mixing different types. Have you noticed it could be related to that or simply the amount of alcohol you are drinking?. EOS 0 0 13 It is typically the amount I' m drinking, but cutting out drinking as a whole has probably helped me the most. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Certainly making sure that you only drink a certain amount like a couple drinks of beer or only a shot of harder drinks might alleviate this or refraining from mixing drinks. Sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep... the amount you drink. Do your friends encourage you to drink more? EOS 0 0 15 They don' t necessarily attempt to get me to drink more in volume, but I do have to tell them I' m not gonna go out for the night. EOS 0 1 16 [Question] Are they okay with it when you decline?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hi, I feel really sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am sorry. What is going on? EOS 4 0 3 My friends won' t hang out with me. I am alone all the time. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel like they don' t want to be around you and have nobody to talk to?
0 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I am good, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m doing well, but it could have been better. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] What seems to be bothering you tonight? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, my boy friend of 3 years has refused to take our relationship to the next level and I' m kind of getting tired, I don' t want to play games anymore. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don' t feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,. EOS 0 0 6 exactly, I hate to feel that I' m wasting my time. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand that, as I was in a long term relationship and I felt as though my girlfriend at the time did not want to take things to the next step and I was not happy about it.. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I love him so dearly to want to settle down with him, but if he doesn' t want that for me I would rather call it quits now than continue and be disappointed at the long run.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you had that conversation with him? I know it might be a difficult conversation to have, but it is often good to get expectations out in the open so you are on the same page with your partner.. EOS 0 0 10 Yes, sort of and he gave me the impression that he is not there yet and that was a like almost a year ago, I don' t want it to look like I' m pushing him if I try to talk to him again about it. His nonchalant attitude in not seeing the seriousness of it is killing me, I' m just not happy. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] That is tough, but sometimes people just portray things differently, for instance I am also very laid back and nonchalant about most things which can lead to miscommunications.. I don' t think it would be pushing if you haven' t had that conversation in almost a year. EOS 0 0 12 I hope you are right, just don' t want to come across as a desperate person and that' s why I' m setting myself up to call it quits if he tries to sound like he sounded the last time. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You need to know where he is so you can make a good decision for yourself! I know it is difficult, but I know you can get through it! EOS 0 0 14 You are right, that' s exactly what I' m going to do because the wait is killing me. EOS 0 1 15 [Others] Good, I am happy for you! EOS 0 0 16 Thank you very much, you' ve been a great help. EOS 0 1 17 [Others] I am glad I was able to help!
6 0 0 Hello, how are you?. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 6 0 2 I' m alright, honestly I' m feeling rather ashamed. The reason for that and the problem that I' m facing is that I' ve had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and I' m only 24 years old. Right now in my life I' m ready to seek help, but I' m having a lot of anxiety about it because I' m very worried about how others will judge me. I' m worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that I will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. I' m ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that I' ve made that have gotten me here and I guess my problem is that I just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that I can just finally make the step that I need so desperately and get help. EOS 6 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am in a good position to help you as I am in the same situation. Please know you are not alone. I would definitely recommend seeking help sooner rather than later! Hello? Are you wanting to talk? EOS 6 0 4 Yes of course I didn' t hear it go off, my apologies. I really appreciate that, it really is helpful knowing that I' m not the only one who feels this way. I really know that that' s what I need to do, and I am trying my best to get over my fears and just do it ya know. EOS 6 1 5 [Question] What level of alcohol consumption do you have? EOS 6 0 6 no matter how hard it seems, maybe it wont be when I actual do it. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Trust me everyone will be very sympathetic:). Everyone there will be in the same place. And the longer you keep drinking the more damage you are doing to yourself. EOS 6 0 8 and quite a bit, about half a gallon or more a day. And thank you, I really do appreciate your help. I know that and I know its time for me to better my life because its no way to live ya know. Id like to grow up and have a normal life(:. EOS 6 1 9 [Others] I am not sure how much half a gallon is to you... I am in the UK and I know it differs between the US and UK:) EOS 6 0 10 thank you, i do feel better about going now. I just dont know what to expect and it can be scary sometimes. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You will be treated with respect at all times. You might even find that you make some new friends:) Ping:) EOS 6 0 12 You' re right, and that' s what I probably need also is some friends who are in similar positions. EOS 6 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' d recommend online message boards. EOS 6 0 14 They' d understand my situation more, and be good influences. EOS 6 1 15 [Greeting] Anyway I hope I have been able to help and thank you for talking! EOS 6 0 16 alright, I havent looked into those but thats a good idea. I definitely will tonight.. Of course, you really have. I appreciate your advice, it really did help calm my mind about the whole situation. Thank you again(: EOS 6 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Most welcome! Can you press quit first as alas I can' t do it from my end till you have.
4 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello, How are you today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m really depressed. My fiance left me yesterday. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it? EOS 4 0 3 Yes, I think that might make me feel better. I really have no one to talk to because my family and friends didn' t like him so they think this is for the best. EOS 4 1 4 [Greeting] Ok. I am happy to listen.. EOS 4 0 5 I just don' t understand why someone would pretend to be happy for a year and then decide they were lying and leave. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Seems like you feel your partner betrayed you, does that sound right?. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I feel very betrayed.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is understandable. I know how you feel, may I suggest taking a few minutes to clear your head, and making a plan to talk with your friends and parents about how you feel? EOS 4 0 9 They think I should just get over it because they didn' t like him so they think I shouldn' t like him either. They' re making things worse for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] Oh I' m so sorry, sometimes family and friends don' t think about your feelings. When did this happen? EOS 4 0 11 He left yesterday. I had no warning. He just packed up all his stuff and said he didn' t want to marry me and the last year has been a lie. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Dang. he seems very selfish. But I understand how up setting it must have felt. My first husband left me without warning. EOS 4 0 13 I' m sorry to hear that. How long did it take you to feel better? EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Awhile. it started to feel a little bit better after I kept telling myself it was about him and not about me, then I started feeling a bit better. But it will take time, the old say is correct, good days and bad days.. EOS 4 0 15 What did you do to help feel better> EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Started back in to my routine. Work. Church. things like that.. EOS 4 0 17 I think it' s harder that it' s during the holidays because I don' t go back to work until after the new year. I thought we would be spending the next week together at home. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] My I suggestion you pick your closest friend, and talk to her/ him about your feeling, but not about your boyfriend, about how you feel your friends have been treating you. Be nice but firm. I bet once they hear your pain, they will be very supportive.
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work. EOS 4 0 14 Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn' t even want me to help her, no she doesn' t work. EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 4 1 2 [Greeting] I am good how are you. EOS 4 0 3 I am glad you are doing well, I have been struggling lately as my girlfriend that I was going to propose to broke up with me. She told me that my career path was different then hers and she just did not see it working out. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] How was your career path different? I understand how you are feeling everything will be okay. EOS 4 0 5 She had a desire to do marine biology and I wanted to pursue law enforcement as a police officer, however due to my back injury that fell through recently. She would spend most of her time doing field work, which would require her to spend time out at sea. She was working in a nursing home at the time and was not a marine biologist.. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] She did not like your career path? EOS 4 0 7 I am thinking that would be the case, however we dated for 3 years and then reconnecting about a year later which at this time was a distant relationship. She now has a boyfriend which she started date about 2 months she broke up with me. I found out that he works with her at the nursing home. I am unsure what to think, but she did say that she just didn' t see how our career paths would work out and that was that.. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right. It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after. EOS 4 0 9 I have had some friends echo that. I agree, it definitely felt like I was giving a lot through the time we dated. I have always wondered if this was a true statement, knowing her I think she probably got scared of what that entailed or just the distance. The new boyfriend was definitely a wild card, that I think has caused me to question her parting words. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don' t support your career. I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self. EOS 4 0 11 I appreciate your feedback on this,( this event for context occurred about a year ago and I have moved on from it) my support system has said the same thing. I think the difficult part is just overcoming that mental/ emotional hurdle of having the desire to marry her, which failed since it was an expectation of what was to come. I appreciate your suggestions. I think being the best" me" will help equip me for my future spouse!:). EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Right i can understand how you are feeling. We all have been in a situation where we have the desire to marry someone and all that fails. I have been in a situation like that. EOS 4 0 13 What did you do to help overcome the depression you faced or the grief of what was?. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I just had to let it go and just focus on myself because i had no choice. EOS 4 0 15 That is a valid point, I appreciate your help with this situation and listening to what I experienced.. EOS 4 1 16 [Greeting] No problem. Merry Christmas!
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how is your day? EOS 0 0 1 Not good. I was told today that my contract is not being renewed once it ends this month. I am very anxious about finding another job during pandemic. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see, It' s been a difficult year for all of us. But I think it would be possible to negotiate. EOS 0 0 3 But I tried negotiating. They are down - sizing the entire sales department. What else can I do? EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Hmmm, I can see that this is stressful for you. Did you already search for a new job? EOS 0 0 5 Yes I am preparing my resume but job vacancies are few and far between. I am worried about my next job. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Okay then, It' s good that you already started. But first of all stop being panicked. EOS 0 0 7 Ok. Do you have any ideas for sales positions? EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Search online and locally, get help from your friends and I assure you if you try hard enough you will suceed.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there how can be of help? EOS 3 0 2 I am suffering from low mood and general depression. I don' t know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down( obviously) and there doesn' t appear to be any real reason behind it. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue? EOS 3 0 4 I felt this way for a while actually isn' t a recent change it' s been building slowly over time. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same? EOS 3 0 6 I think I know what you mean. It' s getting worse. I feel very down. EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse. EOS 3 0 8 Yeah. I worry that I' ll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. I' m really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Firstly, you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with depression and it' s good that you have reached out for help for this. EOS 3 0 10 Any suggestions on what to do about it? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many reasons people have depression. It is a recognised medical condition and the good news is that there is help out there. The first step is recognising the problem. EOS 3 0 12 Ok well there is definitely a problem. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Have you spoken to friends and family about this? do they know how much you are struggling with it at the moment? EOS 3 0 14 not really I don' t want to bother other people with my problems. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. I think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help.
4 0 0 Hi I am so sad my boyfriend was cheating and broke up with me when I found out. I don' t think I can ever be happy again. EOS 4 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self - esteem is that true? EOS 4 0 2 I have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. I have lost interest in everything I can barely make myself go to work. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better?
2 0 0 Hey. I am really scared about my job prospects. I am really fearful about my job situation. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] When did this fear start? EOS 2 0 2 It has been a while. I have had fears going back to my childhood traumas. I think that the work situation has only exacerbated that. The current economic climate has really made me fearful.... not sure if I am going to be able to keep my job. EOS 2 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct? EOS 2 0 4 Somewhat. But, my fears are relevant because I don' t know if I will always have a job. EOS 2 1 5 [Question] Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job? EOS 2 0 6 Do you know what I mean? What say u? I have some, but they have their own problems to deal with. Everyone has problems. Do you know what I mean? EOS 2 1 7 [Self-disclosure] You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hi, how are you feeling today? EOS 3 0 2 I am not feeling the best. I have been having some depression, because of not being able to see friends and family during this pandemic. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Oh, boy, do I know that feeling! How are you dealing with it?( if I may ask) EOS 3 0 4 I try to message them as much as possible and call them on the phone but it is just not the same as actually getting to give the a hug and see them in person. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] I know that. I use Zoom, just to see them... do you have a computer? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. That works for some of my family but I have family in the nursing home that does not have access to computers. I haven' t seen them in several months. It just breaks my heart. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh. I can feel it. I have someone who' s sick as well. Do you have any one friend with whom you can share your feelings, your depression. I understand you' re having issues with depression, right? It sometimes helps me to feel that we' re all in this together. And, at the other end of this, we will be able to give the biggest hugs ever! EOS 3 0 8 Yes. I have some very dear friends that have helped me a lot. I guess the depression is just worse because it is the holidays and this is the first year that I haven' t got to spend it with my extended family members. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Oh.... That' s so tough... it being the first year!!!! Sometimes, I cry( I cry with my cat), and just to say the feelings out loud makes me feel a bit better. EOS 3 0 10 Yeah. I have a little dog that has been my cuddle buddy. I have had him for 13 years so he has seen me ugly cry many times. What are some things you do to deal with depression? EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I try to read, watch programs or podcasts that take away my negativity. Anything that will give me a lift, so that my own depression won' t get so bad that I can' t remember what it felt like to be a bit happy.
3 1 0 [Greeting] hello!! EOS 3 0 1 I am very depressed. I found out that my girlfriend is cheating on me with my friend! EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] that' s really bad. even I was also in the same situation. EOS 3 0 3 I have been with her for close to 2 years and now she has been cheating me right under my nose for the past few months! how foolish of me to blindly trust her... How did you deal with it? EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] To be honest i was not completely came out it since it was 3 years but now i somehow getting better i tried to divert myself from the thoughts engage myself with other friends spend more time with my family like that. try to divert yourself, keep yourself busy, spend more time with family, try to minimize the usage of mobile. EOS 3 0 5 But my family is away from me in another country. I can' t even go back due to this stupid covid! I feel betrayed and like dying.

0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 0 0 2 Just feeling sad. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad? EOS 0 0 4 Not being able to leave the house with Covid. plus my hours were cut at work. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut. What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time? EOS 0 0 6 Yes it sucks. I live alone now so there really hard sometimes. I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos. Nothing productive. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it' s not the same as face to face. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I have one close friend that I talk to every now and then. Its not like it use to be. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That' s still a win. EOS 0 0 10 We used to be able to go out and have a few beers together.. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. Keep that connection. It' s not going to be the same due to the circumstances. But at least you are seeking to keep that connection, and that is a good thing. EOS 0 0 12 I hope that this vaccine thing is reason and we can get back to the norm.. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it' s not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest.

EOS 0 0 3 im feeling very overwhelmed and cant get anything done cause i dont know where to start! i want to declutter my house but dont know where to start. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I hear you, feeling overwhelmed and like you don' t know where to start can leave a person feeling stressd forsure! Decluttering sounds like a great idea! Sometimes taking baby steps is a good place to start! EOS 0 0 5 but there are so many thinggs to do and ideas i have. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Of course! It can feel so stressful when we have all these little things we want to do but don' t know where to start! EOS 0 0 7 should i start in one room or one group of things and collect them from all the rooms? EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What is one little area that maybe seems easier to start with? Yeah, that' s a great idea! EOS 0 0 9 well i seem to start and them i end up jumoing to another thing! jumping.

EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried maybe using a timer or making a list to help keep you focused on decluttering one area at a time? Of course! It' s easy to be hard on ourselves, but just the fact that you are trying is so important! EOS 0 0 13 u know what i bought a timer and it came in today! hopefully it will help!

2 1 0 [Question] Hello, how may i help you today? EOS 2 0 1 hi. I am not sure I offended my close friend, I' m scared, he will see pictures of the car I bought for my wife today on my status. actually, I have initial plan to get the a as a birthday gift for my wife before he came to ask for the money. EOS 2 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so you are scared your friend will get mad at you for buying your wife a car after he came asking for money from you? is that correct? EOS 2 0 3 I don' t know how to explain the matter, why I can' t borrow him the money. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] Have you talked to him recently? EOS 2 0 5 yes, you are on l ine with me. yes. EOS 2 1 6 [Question] Has he said anything about the car? EOS 2 0 7 no, he saw the post of the car on my status, but he did' nt say anything. EOS 2 1 8 [Question] do you think he is mad at you? EOS 2 0 9 yes, naturally he will congratulate me as he viewed the pictures. EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i know this can be a tough situation but I believe this situation will pass and everything will be ok between you to. do not let this stress you out or worry that he is mad everything will be ok. i would suggest asking him if he saw your post about the car and ask him if he is mad about it. EOS 2 0 11 ok. can I face him, to ask such question. EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you are comfortable enough facing him then ask him. Just do not force yourself if you are not comfortable doing that. EOS 2 0 13 may be I should tell one of our friends that I think he is mad at me. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if you are more comfortable texting him then i would suggest doing that but i would not just say nothing about you buying the car you should just let him know. EOS 2 0 15 so, we can both settle the matter, I did not have enough money to borrow him at that time because of my initial plan for my wife. ok. thanks for your time. EOS 2 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] I know how you are feeling about that.
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave? EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad. EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more. I feel that everyone must know that I' ve been dumped and be laughing at me. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time. EOS 1 0 10 I did not really have any choice though. I do not see any future for myself now that we are separated. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] do you know brene brown and her work. EOS 1 0 12 No I do not, who is that? EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her TED talk and there' s a great youtube video on empathy. EOS 1 0 14 Thank you, I will. Right now I really need some sort of emotional support. I feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i bring her up because what i sounds like is that you are feeling embarrassed because your partner made a choice that wasn' t you. in reality the choice they made wasn' t about you, it was about them. EOS 1 0 16 It is not so much that - it is that I feel that I dedicated the majority of my adult life to this relationship and now there is nothing left. EOS 1 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are left and you are enough. even if you dont feel like it right now you are enough. EOS 1 0 18 I really do not feel like it right now. What was the last fifteen years all about? I wanted to have children with him and he refused but now I hear he is expecting a baby with another woman. EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] a relationship is part of who you are. it isn' t you. EOS 1 0 20 But it is very difficult to try to strike out on my own again and I do not know if I even want to. EOS 1 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it is hard. it sucks. but the voyage through the suck is going to be better for you than you may realize right now. EOS 1 0 22 But I feel that I am facing middle age on my own and I really do not want to do that. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you have survived 14 days without a bad relationship. keep on doing that day by day and before you know it, you will be on the other side of the bad feelings. EOS 1 0 24 What happens if I just can' t ever get over it though? Right now it' s hard to see any sort of way through these feelings. EOS 1 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, middle age is scary, but there are so many things you can do. ageism is out. EOS 1 0 26 I feel I might have missed out on my chance to have a family of my own though, because I waited fifteen years and my partner would not go for that. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] please watch the cartoon animals and brene brown on youtube talk about empathy. find one of your friends who has been through the suck and let them help you find your path out. EOS 1 0 28 Most of my friends seem to be very happily coupled up right now. They are sympathetic but they do not really understand. EOS 1 1 29 [Self-disclosure] i had an emergency ovary removal in my early 30s and didn' t know if i woudl be able to have children. my doctor told me that the most important thing i could do was to be healthy becuse a healthy mother was what i could give my children even if i adopted them. EOS 1 0 30 That sounds like very good advice from both you and your doctor. It is a difficult thing to have to confront though. I really do appreciate the fact that you have taken the time to talk honestly with me. EOS 1 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you want an empathetic friend. nobody has gone through the exact same thing you have but the emotions are common ones. you will be ok, even if you dont feel that way now. EOS 1 0 32 I hope that I will but am not sure. I really do feel rather better about things now though but - there' s a long way to go. Thank you so much for your support! EOS 1 1 33 [Others] stay strong and stay safe.
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner.
0 0 0 Hi. Hello, can you help me? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I hope so. What kind of problem are you having? EOS 0 0 2 I am really struggling with my studies at the moment, I am so anxious that I keep putting off my essays and worrying all the time. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are a student who is having trouble. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, I am a mature student and struggling with my course. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand how you feel. I was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school. It is very understandable that you are feeling stressed, especially with the pandemic and other issues happening. EOS 0 0 6 yes, the pandemic is making it worse. I am working as well so I am struggling juggling them all and running a house. I just don' t know how to get back on track with my studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about putting together a schedule to help you manage your time? EOS 0 0 8 How would I go about that? EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you go online, there are different templates for students. One would be a time management template where you fill in the blocks of different times of the day. Also, do you know any of your classmates that you could email or text for support? EOS 0 0 10 okay, I can see the sense in that. Have you used them before, if so would you recommend putting everything on there or keeping it flexible? I do have a couple that i could contact, I' ve been feeling really embarrassed to contact them, like they might think I am being silly. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] To start, fill in one week to see what all activities you have to do. Set aside specific time for doing your schoolwork. Try and stick with the schedule. EOS 0 0 12 Okay, one week doesn' t seem too scary. I could colour coordinate it, I like things in colour. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] . I would try it. EOS 0 0 14 Ok, do you think I should reach out to my classmates, will they think i' m being silly, I really don' t want to alienate them. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe there is a discussion board where you could be anonymous. Break your writing down in small chunks. Just brainstorm one day, for example. EOS 0 0 16 I don' t think so, however, I might just start with the template and see if that helps first. I like the idea of breaking things into the chunks. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try one thing at a time so you are not overwhelmed. EOS 0 0 18 Thank you, I feel a little better, maybe I just needed some control. Yes, that' s good, one thing at once. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I agree. You are not alone. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you, you have been really helpful. EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hang in there. It is great that you are in school. EOS 0 0 22 Thank you.. EOS 0 1 23 [Greeting] I enjoyed chatting with you. Take care.
2 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are we doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Okay how are you? EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Im doing great thanks. Anything on your mind today? EOS 2 0 3 Just pondering microcheating and wondering why someone who I do not like that way would be considered microcheating. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] And what do you mean by microcheating? EOS 2 0 5 It is a new thing like having a man you like that you check up on on social media even though you are in a relationship, or eating lunch with the same woman or man that you like but you don' t act on because you are married. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh i see, well i think overthinking things like that can lead to unwanted emotions. Or putting yourself in a situation with another person when you are in a relationship might mean there are other issues going on. EOS 2 0 7 Yes i see that. No nothing else going on just thinking that the definition maybe shouldn' t be as exact for the type of person that I do not talk to because of his reservations about it. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, if you are not talking to them then i see no harm. If you are talking to them with some sort of intention to for a relationship beyond friendship then i see issues arising. EOS 2 0 9 That is what I feel. I am not talking to him. I had to the other day to get in contact with someone( medical emergency) but do not call just to chat and catch up. I even unfriended him. I just want to comfort him over it but I think it is best just to never speak of him again. Comfort my fiance. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] To never speak to your fiance? If you want to continue your relationship and you do not feel you can continue a platonic relationship with this other person then that might be best. EOS 2 0 11 No I am ending my friendship with him. That is what is best. EOS 2 1 12 [Question] I think it might be as well if you cannot control it. I do have to ask though, are you happy with your Fiance? EOS 2 0 13 Yes very. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Then i 100% back you on your decision. Id take this time to focus on you too. Strengthen the bond a bit. EOS 2 0 15 Yes, I think that would be best. I thank you for your time. EOS 2 1 16 [Greeting] I thank you for opening up! EOS 2 0 17 It is okay see talking about this is actually microcheating. So now I am worried about that. EOS 2 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really wouldnt even consider it cheating to have feelings. Acting on them or trying to strengthen them may be though. EOS 2 0 19 Yes that is true. My fiance is over seas for work for the next 13 mos so I am here in the states alone. We get to talk but he isnt here with me so having no one to talk to is lonely. That is why I brought it up. EOS 2 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see that, have you tried to talk to your friends about this issue? Or even try a therapist? Maybe you and your Fiance can figure out more times to talk with facetime or zoom. Do a virtual date night.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 3 0 1 Hello. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, i feel like i am in depsression. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed?? EOS 3 0 5 My partner broke up with me impromptu. EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now. EOS 3 0 7 Exactly, that is my current situation. I feel like my entire life has been rearranged. How did you deal with them and specifically what was your coping mechanism? EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days. I slowly realised that i had put myself in slow motion and then slowly started to do things i used to do to maybe come out of it. EOS 3 0 9 True, what ways would you suggest i use to approach my situation and get out of this state? It is very pathetic really when you think of it, halting all your life activities and plans just because a relationship ended. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well i had a close friend that i was able to vent to and help me see what was important. Do you have anyone close in your life you could talk to for guidance? EOS 3 0 11 Close friends can really be helpful in such situations. Yes, i do have a close friend even though i am very poor when it comes to opening up. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see what you mean about pathetic lol. But rather than see yourself as pathetic in a negative, use that defiance to push yourself back out into the world. Start slowly with opening up, maybe even tell your friend you intent and ask them to be patient as you learn to better express your inner feelings. EOS 3 0 13 Yes, i should do that because at the end of it all i still have myself to take care of. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think youre already on the right track. I just know you can get back to you!
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how is your day? EOS 0 0 1 Not good. I was told today that my contract is not being renewed once it ends this month. I am very anxious about finding another job during pandemic. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see, It' s been a difficult year for all of us. But I think it would be possible to negotiate. EOS 0 0 3 But I tried negotiating. They are down - sizing the entire sales department. What else can I do? EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Hmmm, I can see that this is stressful for you. Did you already search for a new job?
1 0 0 I' m having issues with my parents. You can say we are having a conflict. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] What kind of issues do you think you are having? EOS 1 0 2 well they won' t allow me to date this girl i met online.. They told she' s bad news. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today. Have you tried talking to you parents about why she is" bad news"? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, i tried but it won' t get through their head. There are so old school. They want me to date someone close to my age. is 15 year difference too big of a gap? EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] The basic problem is that your parents believe that 15 years is too large of an age gap between you guys. Is there any other reasons your parents dissaporve of her? EOS 1 0 6 They told me she' s gold digger. Yes i come from money but hey this girl is the one.. EOS 1 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You believe that the girl is not a gold digger, but instead you guys like each other for who you are. Money is not an issue for you guys?
0 1 0 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] hi. EOS 0 0 1 Online learning is not seems easy, Seems I am going to fail this year. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] chill my dear friend, nothing of that sort will happen. EOS 0 0 3 In - class learning was way better and I learned a lot but now its so confusing. EOS 0 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] everything you need is a little peace of mind, patience and little more effort. EOS 0 0 5 Even working with online tools is hard. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] i understand, but just think everyone else like us are doing the same and facing the same difficulties. EOS 0 0 7 I know but what is I loose a whole year in academic,. EOS 0 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Think positive my dear friend. Shake all your negatives. EOS 0 0 9 But I have been in low grades continuously during my last semesters. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Just have the confidence within yourselves and believe in YOU, that is the most important thing. Stop worrying, and think about what can make it better. EOS 0 0 11 Well it is still hard to understand online learning tools. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Watch Youtube videos. EOS 0 0 13 And my internet sometime screws up when I am submitting the assignments. I tried that but I am not tech savy. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Why cant you seek help from a friend of yours who studies well? And who is ready to spend time and help you.
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic? EOS 0 0 16 so literally, I only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. I only started a new work in September, and it' s not much( about two days a week), so I can' t comment too much about that. It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hi, how are you feeling today? EOS 3 0 2 I am not feeling the best. I have been having some depression, because of not being able to see friends and family during this pandemic. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Oh, boy, do I know that feeling! How are you dealing with it?( if I may ask) EOS 3 0 4 I try to message them as much as possible and call them on the phone but it is just not the same as actually getting to give the a hug and see them in person. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] I know that. I use Zoom, just to see them... do you have a computer? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. That works for some of my family but I have family in the nursing home that does not have access to computers. I haven' t seen them in several months. It just breaks my heart. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh. I can feel it. I have someone who' s sick as well. Do you have any one friend with whom you can share your feelings, your depression. I understand you' re having issues with depression, right? It sometimes helps me to feel that we' re all in this together. And, at the other end of this, we will be able to give the biggest hugs ever! EOS 3 0 8 Yes. I have some very dear friends that have helped me a lot. I guess the depression is just worse because it is the holidays and this is the first year that I haven' t got to spend it with my extended family members. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Oh.... That' s so tough... it being the first year!!!! Sometimes, I cry( I cry with my cat), and just to say the feelings out loud makes me feel a bit better.
1 0 0 im very upset. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry. Would you like to tell me about it? EOS 1 0 2 yes. i invited my friend over to watch my new puppy while i painted my room because my dog has seperation anxiety and can' t be alone. then she showed up with her new boyfriend. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] What bothered you about that? EOS 1 0 4 well i dont know him and my stuff was all out in the living room where he was alone for most of the day. i actually didnt suspect anything would happen at first. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can see why that would upset you though. Did something happen? EOS 1 0 6 yes, after they left, i started putting my stuff back in my room and realized the purse i keep my nintendo switch in was GONE. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m so sorry that happened to you. I would be very upset as well. EOS 1 0 8 i' ve known her for 8 years. but this guy is very new. they' re not even officially together. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Did you speak to your friend about it? EOS 1 0 10 yes, so i called her and asked her if she saw my bag and she got defensive. she started talking about how much money he has and how he doesnt have to steal. EOS 1 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It is sometimes hard for people to believe someone they care about could do something bad.
4 1 0 [Question] Good evening. What would you like to talk about? EOS 4 0 1 evening. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you feeling at the moment? EOS 4 0 3 i lost those books, I cannot even explain, how it happen. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have lost some books? Were they important to you? EOS 4 0 5 I price one of the books, Amazon said 1000. yes. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] So you have lost a book that is worth a thousand dollars? I can imagine you are feeling really bad about that. EOS 4 0 7 where will I g et almost 3 thousand dollars. It is too painful. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I do not know.. have you considered taking an extra job on the side? EOS 4 0 9 yes, i do. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to get help with finding the books? Someone could have handed them in. EOS 4 0 11 school, should just give me enough time to find the books. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you have any idea of where you lost them? EOS 4 0 13 allow me to clear myself later, it is a fucking thing. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] I am sorry, I do not understand what you mean.
0 0 0 hello? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 stressed. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It is a stressful time, why are you feeling stressed? EOS 0 0 4 work, kids, school. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand. EOS 0 0 6 how many kids do you have? what kind of degree do you have? EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have 2 kids, How many kids do you have? I have a bachelor degree. EOS 0 0 8 6 year old twin boys and an 8 year old daughter. i' m divorced. they sleep at his house and he gets them off the bus. i start work at 6 so i cna get off at 2 and get them off the bus at 3. i' m going for my master' s degree. i am about halfway done. EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Managing things all become stressful, but Im sure you are really good at what you are doing! EOS 0 0 10 im so tired all the time. i feel lik everything i do just isnt enough. how do you handle things and stress? EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats are not true, You have beautiful kids, work and pursuing master' s. You are a great achiever. EOS 0 0 12 i guess. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Deep breaths and practicing mindfulness will help you relieve some stress. EOS 0 0 14 I WISH I HAD TIME LOL. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I sometimes do Meditation or go for a 10 mins walk. EOS 0 0 16 i guess it is worth a try. anythign else?* anything. EOS 0 1 17 [Others] Thats true with your busy schedule finding the balance is challenge. EOS 0 0 18 i am a multitasking queen, but even then i still dont have enough time it seems lol. EOS 0 1 19 [Others] Hope you feel relaxed just chatting with me for a change.
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 I' m sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What happened? EOS 4 0 3 My ex - boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Why did he break up with you?
4 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling really sad and lonely right now. My boyfriend and I broke up and it was me who wanted it but now I regret breaking up and he doesn' t want me back. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, I can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it' s too late. EOS 4 0 3 That is exactly it. I broke up with him because I liked another person but then quickly realized that I made a mistake and it' s too late. I want him back should I start calling and going to his house to beg? EOS 4 1 4 [Question] nobody knows him better than you do, right now I do not think he is in a good place either since it wasn' t his choice to end it, how do you think he would react if you started pressuring him?. EOS 4 0 5 I haven' t really thought of that yet. He has a pretty short temper actually. I know he is really mad at me so I think he might want to yell at me and get his anger out before he could start being nice to me again. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this, perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel, without pressuring him into a response. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah, that' s true. I have been secretly watching his social media and he has girls asking him out and I don' t want to let them get to him before I can get him back. I want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] you can always ask him calmly if he would like to talk, so you both have a chance to express your feelings in a safe way, with no yelling or arguing, do you think that' s something he would do? EOS 4 0 9 I can try that, I think he might be responsive at first if I dont set him off. All of his friends hate me so I have nobody on my side right now. Should I try to get his friends to like me again? Is that an way I could use to get him to want me again? EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] nobody likes to see that one' s friend is sad because of someone else, I think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back.
4 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 4 0 2 I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age?
3 0 0 Hi, How are you doing? I am in bad mood.. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] What' s wrong? EOS 3 0 2 This work from home tension and cant go out with my family and parties. It makes me depressed and cant bear this pathedic situation. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. I, too, am struggling with COVID - 19. It' s going to be difficult not to see family during the holidays. We' ll get through this, though, don' t you think. Have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone? Maybe there is a way to find ways to have fun online with your friends and family. We actually played games together recently. Is that something you could do to reconnect? EOS 3 0 4 I am fully occupied with my job. This software field sucks me. Even weekends also they are expecting to work with offshore people. I dont find the time to spend with my partner and kids. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there any way you could talk to your supervisor about achieving a better work life balance? EOS 3 0 6 Yeah! Good Idea, I ll make a call with my Manager once. It could be better to have vacation for a week. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that could make a big difference in changing things for you. You just need a better work/ life balance to straighten things out. I had a similar experience in the past, and talking with my manager about time off reinvigorated me. EOS 3 0 8 Exactly. Please suggest me any idea to spend my time with my family and away from this work pressure. Sounds good! I ll arrange a conversation with my head then. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] With COVID - 19, it may limit your options, but you could decide which activities you would collectively enjoy the most, and try to do them as often as possible together.
4 0 0 Hi. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hi. How can I help you. EOS 4 0 2 I am not happy. I lost my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, thats bad. When you lost your job? EOS 4 0 4 about 4 months ago. EOS 4 1 5 [Question] In which field you are looking for? EOS 4 0 6 Bus driver and/ or Production. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can try as a school driver. As school now opened You will get it.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Not so great - found out i' m losing my job in january. EOS 2 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] On no I am sorry to hear that! I know that must be tough. EOS 2 0 3 Yes I' m not even sure what steps to take right now. EOS 2 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea that can be difficult. Have you started looking for something else? EOS 2 0 5 Not yet, I' m not even sure where to begin. I have not looked for a job in 20 years. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way.
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. EOS 3 0 16 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. EOS 3 0 18 That is a good point.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. EOS 3 0 20 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand. EOS 3 0 22 I should trust my partner more than any random person. EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters. EOS 3 0 24 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? EOS 3 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you.... even after work. EOS 3 0 26 okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. EOS 3 0 28 That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you? EOS 3 0 30 Okay. I will keep that in mind. We are 22. EOS 3 1 31 [Question] Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? EOS 3 0 32 Yes but less over the past few months. EOS 3 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related.... for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. EOS 3 0 34 That' s understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. EOS 3 1 35 [Providing Suggestions or Information] How do you all generally communicate? Through text? EOS 3 0 36 He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends.. EOS 3 1 37 [Question] Which do you and your man like to communicate? EOS 3 0 38 No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something. EOS 3 1 39 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay just anxious. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that' s bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I believe i am going to fail all my finals for college. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] College finals are a stressful time for sure, I' m sure you' re doing your best to prepare. EOS 0 0 6 Yes i have been studying for hours everyday. sometimes it is hard to focus. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s best to take a short break to reset when you feel like your gears are grinding. EOS 0 0 8 that is true, but i feel guilty when i take breaks. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I often feel the same way when I' m not busy doing work. But sometimes you need that little break to get back into the zone and be more productive.
1 0 0 I' m qualified for a promotion but my boss is refusing to promote me based on biased feedback he has received from someone else. EOS 1 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn' t willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right? EOS 1 0 2 Yes that' s right. It' s frustratgn.* frustrating. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co - worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective. EOS 1 0 4 Unfortunately I can' t really talk to anyone at work because there is no one I trust to this extent. Promotions are a bit of a sensitive issue. EOS 1 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you reported to your HR department the issue around biased feedback being used as a determining factor in not being considered? EOS 1 0 6 The HR department favours managers so I am worried that will damage my chances of promotion further. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry you have to deal with this at work. I think you deserve the promotion because you are very dedicated. EOS 1 0 8 Thanks, that' s good to hear. EOS 1 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think if you continue to advocate for yourself in a positive manner you could possibly increase the chances of being considered for the promotion. EOS 1 0 10 It' s hard to be positive when I feel like my manager is not receptive to my opinions and just trusts the feedback given by this one other person. EOS 1 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' ve worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment. My co - workers were not supportive and I was always overlooked. Eventually, I realized that the environment was toxic and chose to start applying for different jobs. I felt like if my potential couldn' t be appreciated then I should go somewhere with opportunities for growth. EOS 1 0 12 Maybe it is time for me to start looking elsewhere for better opportunities. I' ve worked at this place so long that I have become comfortable here and the thought of searching for a new job is intimidating. EOS 1 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You' ve got this! It' s easy to become comfortable in what we know but, change causes us to grow. EOS 1 0 14 Yeah I agree, it' s uncomfortable and difficult though! I haven' t searched for a new job in so long, I feel like I will perform terribly at the interviews. EOS 1 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Just start slowly and remember that you can be picky about what position you chose. I also think we all feel like we perform badly during interviews. Preparation is key. I hope discussing your work situation today has made you feel a bit better!
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. EOS 6 0 1 hello. how are you? I wanted to briefly chat about my jealous feeling. My friend sent me a pic as a greeting showing her hubby and I am jealous. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] I am doing good. How are you? EOS 6 0 3 Next time I see her I want to hide my jealous feeling, but not sure if I can do it well. great. I am good. EOS 6 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so, you envy your friend having a good spouse, is that correct? EOS 6 0 5 yes that is correct. EOS 6 1 6 [Question] Are you a female, if I may ask? EOS 6 0 7 yes. EOS 6 1 8 [Question] Do you have a husband or bf? EOS 6 0 9 I could say I am a female that is one of those left out. not currently. I really don' t know how those women find partners and get married and stay with the same partner for a long time. EOS 6 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You get frustrated that other people are achieving something, you are not able to do. Is that a fair understanding? EOS 6 0 11 I think so, I am not complaining but I guess I am haha. EOS 6 1 12 [Question] What do you think about your self as person? Kid, affectionate, caring?* kind. EOS 6 0 13 I am very sexy and fun but not relaxed, I am caring I think but am not good at showing it. blush! EOS 6 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] To be honest, here what I feel about you.. you have a lots of good qualities, you are a wonderful person. However, you shortchange yourself. If you can, please start building some self confidence.. Be proud of yourself.. Someone having a good hubby does not mean that she is happier than you.
1 0 0 My friend borrowed money from me but she won' t return it now. EOS 1 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry about that. It is always hard when we trust someone and they let us down. is that waht you are feeling? Disappointment in your friend? EOS 1 0 2 Yes, i am very dissapointed because i trusted her completely. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand. I have been through a similar situation. Was it a large amount of money? EOS 1 0 4 What did you do to come out of the tricky situation? Yes, it was for me, a total of$ 10000. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, That is a very large amount of money. I can understand your being upset with them. Have you talked to them about the money and returning it? EOS 1 0 6 Yes, i am very very upset. What would you do in my position? Yes, she just sounded non - comittal, saying that she will return it when she can. EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. It is a financially difficult time for us all. I am wondering if your friend might be upset and embarrassed that they can not pay you back immediately? Have you asked her if she could even afford some sort of small payments? EOS 1 0 8 Yes, i asked her how we could restructure the payment in her favor because i understand how difficult it is for everyone right now but she did not answer. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Were you speaking on the phone or in person? Is this a financial burden for you? Would you consider this person a good friend? Would you be sad if they were not in your life anymore? EOS 1 0 10 We were speaking on phone because i wanted to set up a physical meeting where we could discuss the logistics. Yes, it is a financial burden because this is money i was saving for a venture. EOS 1 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] That is very difficult. It is hard to judge things on the phone. EOS 1 0 12 Yes, this is a really close friend from way back and i would be devastated to lose the friendship. It is difficult to judge on the phone yes, which is why i wanted a physical meeting but she snapped at me and said that she will just pay me when she can. EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I see. I am very sorry about that! it is very difficult when a friend betrays your trust like that. EOS 1 0 14 Yes, very difficult. EOS 1 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing what you can. It is very nice of you to have been this patient. EOS 1 0 16 How do you suggest i shoulp proceed? EOS 1 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is the friendship more important than the money? That is what it came down to for me. EOS 1 0 18 And you chose what? EOS 1 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you can not get her to meet with you, perhaps it might be time to seek advice from a lawyer? That is providing that you are willing to possibly lose a friend. EOS 1 0 20 Thank you very much for the advice. EOS 1 1 21 [Greeting] you are welcome. Good luck! I hope you find resolution and find a way to save your friendship!
3 0 0 Hello, is someone there? EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, my name is Jonathan. May I ask who I am speaking to today? EOS 3 0 2 Hi Jonathan, I' m Keri. EOS 3 1 3 [Greeting] Hi Keri. How are you today? EOS 3 0 4 I' m feeling a little bit down today. I' ve been feeling a little bit down a lot lately. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh no. I' m sorry to hear that. What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately? EOS 3 0 6 My ex - husband is moved in with his new girlfriend. They might get married. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh Keri, that must feel awful. Was it a recent separation between you two? EOS 3 0 8 He started dating a few months after we split up. I don' t know if this is the only person he' s dated but I think so. He really moved on quick. Hi, are you still there? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Yeah I understand what you' re going through. I was in a similar position not too long ago. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. How does it make you feel that he' s trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours? EOS 3 0 10 It makes me feel like he didn' t learn anything from our relationship or like he thinks he' s better than me because he has someone new and I don' t. I' m trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good I think, but sometimes I feel really really lonely too. Like maybe I won' t ever find anyone. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you' re doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another.

EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way. EOS 2 0 7 I' ve tried calling the unemployment office to get some ideas but they do not answer their phones. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Or you could look for some side jobs like cleaning or organizing things until you find something more permanent. EOS 2 0 9 Yeah, i' m kinda old for that - LOL!!! My back would not hold up to that - and my salary wouldn' t be comparable. EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea it seems to be hard to get up with a lot of places at this time. Persistent is the key. EOS 2 0 11 Well I hear that their offices are closed and you have to do everything online - so not sure if they can even help me. EOS 2 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes i understand right now is a very bad time to find anything with so many places closed. Do you have any family or friends to reach out to for help if needed? EOS 2 0 13 I think I might be able to call my friend, but she' s in another state. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you gave any thought to babysitting or are there any crafts you are good at making that maybe you could try to sell?

Would you care to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 3 0 3 I lost my job some months back and it hasn' t really been easy for me. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, loss of income can be very stressful. Have you been looking for work since then? EOS 3 0 5 Sometimes when I enter a place where my friends are, they tend to go silent when I enter the room. Yes. Its been months now and nothing yet. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Why do you think it is that they go silent? EOS 3 0 7 I' m pretty sure they were talking about me. 2 of myy friends have been helping me with rent money. and I' m pretty sure they must be fed up. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried picking up odd jobs maybe cleaning for someone or helping them move or organize there things?
0 0 0 Hi. Is anyone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hi there. EOS 0 0 2 Hi I thought you were not going to show. my anxiety level just increased while I was waiting for you. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Apologies, I have had issues with my connection which should now be resolved. How can I help you today. EOS 0 0 4 I am having a panic attack. I have to come up with 100 by next week to meet my minimum charge. on my credit card. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you need to find 100, have limited time to do this and this is causing you anxiety as a result? EOS 0 0 6 yes it sure is. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, I can tell you are really worried about this and want to find a way to remove the pressure from this situation. EOS 0 0 8 yes any suggestion s. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any friends or family that you can speak to about this? If they were aware of this issue and how much it is affecting you, they may be able to support. EOS 0 0 10 They are swamped with their own bills and we live pay check to pay check. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried contacting the credit card company and explaining your situation? EOS 0 0 12 No I haven' t but if i don' t pay minimum I will get 24% interest penalty. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] that seems excessive. I had a similar situation happened myself once and what I did was transfer the balance of one of my cards onto another.
5 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling today? EOS 5 0 1 uninspired. broken. a rock. a static object. bananas. EOS 5 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, that' s a start. Do I hear you saying that you' re confused at the moment? EOS 5 0 3 not confused. frustrated that I have to produce art for marks when I am not inspired. EOS 5 1 4 [Question] Ah I hear you, education can be both wonderful and difficult can' t it? What are you supposed to produce? EOS 5 0 5 painting after painting. like I am an ikea machine, photocopying picasos for A' s. EOS 5 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that that is very frustrating. Would you consider switching majors? EOS 5 0 7 What is life but a stage. Art is life. I love art.. no. EOS 5 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass. Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of your future and one day it will pay off? EOS 5 0 9 does the sun now set and then rise again. Does the spring not come after winter. Yet I cannot see how art will give me grades. EOS 5 1 10 [Question] Well, I am assuming that you want to go into an artistic field on graduation? EOS 5 0 11 yes, but no like a 9 - 5 job. perhaps i am yet another art failure. art has no time. EOS 5 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you are putting yourself down unnecessarily. Many people do make a lucrative career from an art qualification. I would urge you to keep working to the best of your ability and see what happens. EOS 5 0 13 you speak the truth. I will again pick up my brush and see where my inspiration takes me. oh it has been a joy talking to you. EOS 5 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you ever tried searching for information about careers in your field? We still have a few minutes left:) There are a lot of different ways in which you can use an art degree! EOS 5 0 15 Yes. we do. I will call my newest work the brilliant support of mturk! pls give me more inspriation. EOS 5 1 16 [Others] That sounds like a definite winner:) I see a Turner prize beckoning in your future.

2 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are we doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Okay how are you? EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Im doing great thanks. Anything on your mind today? EOS 2 0 3 Just pondering microcheating and wondering why someone who I do not like that way would be considered microcheating. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] And what do you mean by microcheating?
4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 tired. and u? EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like an exhausting time for a lot of people right now. I' m also a bit tired but doing OK. What' s been on your mind recently? EOS 4 0 3 just trying to finish this semester. EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like a stressful time to be in college. How have you been coping with everything going on? EOS 4 0 5 listening to music. EOS 4 1 6 [Others] Nice! What kind of music do you like? EOS 4 0 7 mainly hip hop and r& b but I dabble in some alternative, hyperpop, and edm. EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I also like hip hop and r& b. It' s too bad we aren' t able to go to any live music events for a while, though. EOS 4 0 9 yea. have u done any of the virtual concerts? EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I' ve seen them advertised but I haven' t tried any of them yet. I think I saw there was a Lil Nas X one coming up though, might check that out. Have you done any? EOS 4 0 11 yea the travis scott one and the nas one just happened yesterday. think there is only one showing left today then theyre done. it was ok nothing amazing. EOS 4 1 12 [Others] Oh good to know. Yeah, I don' t know if virtual concerts can ever really compare to live ones.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with this evening?. EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very depressed lately. Like a constant pressure that i don' t know exactly what it is. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I' m very sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 4 0 3 I think the days getting shorter makes it worse. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating. EOS 4 0 5 Do you have any tips on how to overcome it? EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help. I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through Instagram. I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while.. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up. I like to stay up, but when it' s time to get up i dread it. Bad cycle. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sure, that' s understandable. There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin D, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them..
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you? EOS 1 0 2 Not so good. How are you doing? EOS 1 1 3 [Question] I am doing okay thank you for asking! would you like to talk about whats wrong? EOS 1 0 4 Yes. Well today I had a delivery order. So I went to McDonald' s and pick up the order and took it to the right address and after a few hours I notice that the client did not confirm the order. EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am not knowledgeable in this service industry. Let me understand. You delivered the order, but the customer did not confirm they wanted it.. EOS 1 0 6 Five minutes later my supervisor called me saying that the client call and reported that he did not received his order. And that' s not true at all, I gave him the food. So now i don' t know if they going to fired me or let me keep the job. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation? EOS 1 0 8 Of course I did. He told me he going to give me the benefit of the doubt but that is not enough. Im an honest person and this kind of accusation makes me feel very bad. EOS 1 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I understand, but do not feel bad about yourself. You did your work honestly and delivered the food to your customer. Can I suggest something moving forward?. EOS 1 0 10 Yes. But stuff like that makes me look bad and makes people dont trust me. Sure. That can help. I would appreciate it. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe every time you make a delivery, you can take a picture of it for proof. or maybe you can have a copy of the receipt and have the customer sign it as well. EOS 1 0 12 Well. I normally take pictures of every delivery I make but I let this pass and look what happened. EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] it' s okay, it happens to everyone. we are human and we tend to make the smallest mistakes. The important thing is to learn from them.. Is there anything else bothering you at work? EOS 1 0 14 Yes. It won' t happen again for sure. This makes me dont trust people again. Well. This is the first time I ever faced this kind of problem at work. EOS 1 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] as long as you believe in yourself to be honest, don' t worry about what other people think. Your boss will come to understand you are a honest worker. It is also amazing that you have come such a long way without having other problems. that is great!.
3 0 0 Hello, I' ve been really depressed lately and feel like there isn' t anything I can do to break this feeling. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened? EOS 3 0 2 November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS( its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 4 Yes that is correct. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest. EOS 3 0 6 I know I' m not alone and that' s what makes it hard to reach out, because I don' t want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there' s. It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do. It seems that you don' t want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person. EOS 3 0 8 I just don' t know what to do about it anymore. Yes, I don' t like to bother others or let other people down. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure. Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief? Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think?
3 1 0 [Question] Good afternoon how may I help you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello there. I' m suffering with increased depression and I' m not quite clear why. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately? EOS 3 0 3 No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that' s the same for everyone. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression? EOS 3 0 5 I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I' ve always had a low mood but now I' m anxious that it will continue to get worse. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again? EOS 3 0 7 Since lockdown haven' t spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don' t want this to get any worse. What if she isn' t available?. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It wouldn' t hurt to try and reach out. If she isn' t available, there are other services. EOS 3 0 9 What like support groups etc? I' m also sure this isn' t just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It' s weird and a little concerning to be honest. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app. EOS 3 0 11 I hadn' t thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it' s worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn' t available. Sometimes its good to have options.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi my name is Sarah, how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hi, Sarah. I am at my wits end. I feel like I am going crazy. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That sounds stressful. What' s happening? EOS 0 0 3 I am stressed out about having to move and I just can' t seem to calm down when it is time to sleep.. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Moving is such a stressful time. When do you move?. EOS 0 0 5 I am moving in a month, but there is just so much to do before then. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. What is your wind - down routine like in the evening, if you have one? EOS 0 0 7 I usually put my kids to bed and then try to relax for about an hour while I watch tv before I head to bed. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Oh you' re a parent AND you are moving, you have a lot on your plate! EOS 0 0 9 Yes, I am a homeschooling mother of two.. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried a warm bath before bed? that' s helped me before. Meditation to still my mind before sleeping helps too. I' ve read that a small carb snack before bed, like a peice of toast, is supposed to help us fall asleep, I haven' t tried it though. EOS 0 0 11 A bath does sound really relaxing. I have tried some meditations. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One thing I highly recommend is a podcast called" Tracks to Relax". EOS 0 0 13 Thanks, I will have to try that. Music does tend to calm me down. I don' t know why I haven' t tried that. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It' s guided sleep meditations, and his voice is incredibly soothing.... works well for me on nights I can' t naturally fall asleep. He leads you relaxing walks into the forest and such things, it' s very peaceful. EOS 0 0 15 I really appreciate that help, I will try it for sure. I think it will be easier to focus on a meditation with someone talking me through it. EOS 0 1 16 [Question] Have you a partner sharing the childrearing? EOS 0 0 17 Yes, but he has already moved to our new house because he is working on floors and stuff to get it ready. So I have been alone to stew in my worries. EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see so right now you' re the main" parent - er"? Do you have other family that could take the kids for a wekend so you can have a proper rest? EOS 0 0 19 Yes, I am. But, my children are not very stressful. I think they help more than anything. I have wonderful children. I think it is just the thoughts of moving to a new place and the actual 20 hour drive in a moving truck that is scaring me. I really appreciate your support today. It is helpful to talk it out. Your suggestions were also really good. EOS 0 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have wonderful children beccause they have been well parented by the sounds of it:) EOS 0 0 21 Thank you so much! You have a great day:) EOS 0 1 22 [Greeting] I hope your move goes smoothly.... try to make sure you carve out time for YOU... bye!

Very depressed with having to stay home because of the COVID - 19/ I will appreciate anything you can do to help me. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like social isolation is really weighing on you... EOS 4 0 5 Yes, it sure is. I feel so alone. I feel it will help to talk to an outsider. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Human being are social creatures by nature so please understand that the feelings that you are having are absolutely normal. So dont judge yourself or feel as if something is wrong with YOU. EOS 4 0 7 Sometimes it helps to a stranger - most of my friends feel as I do. I am sure you are right - I thank you for your support.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You mentioned your friends feel the same way you do... Have you guys thought about making trying to do a zoom party?

I don' t know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down( obviously) and there doesn' t appear to be any real reason behind it. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue? EOS 3 0 4 I felt this way for a while actually isn' t a recent change it' s been building slowly over time. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same? EOS 3 0 6 I think I know what you mean. It' s getting worse. I feel very down. EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse. EOS 3 0 8 Yeah. I worry that I' ll just keep feeling even more down and depressed.

Many people struggle with depression and it' s good that you have reached out for help for this. EOS 3 0 10 Any suggestions on what to do about it? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many reasons people have depression. It is a recognised medical condition and the good news is that there is help out there. The first step is recognising the problem. EOS 3 0 12 Ok well there is definitely a problem. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Have you spoken to friends and family about this? do they know how much you are struggling with it at the moment? EOS 3 0 14 not really I don' t want to bother other people with my problems. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. I think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help. EOS 3 0 16 Yeah maybe. I suppose nobody really understands but I could at least speak to them about it. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] everyone has problems and it is good to talk about them because a problem shared is a problem halved. It doesn' t mean the problems will go away but it might help you understand them and then be able to deal with them better. EOS 3 0 18 I don' t want to feel like this anymore. I' m willing to at least give it a go. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also think that it will be worse to get in touch with your doctor or a medical professional. these people are trained to deal with problems like yours and will be able to offer effective Solutions from a medical perspective. EOS 3 0 20 I haven' t spoken to a doctor about this before to be clear I don' t want any medication. EOS 3 1 21 [Question] are you worried that speaking to a doctor will lead to you being given medication, and you don' t want this? EOS 3 0 22 yes that' s right I don' t want to take any pills or anything like that. EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know that some forms of depression are caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain and medication in these cases can help. Also psychologists can support with mental health which means that this would not be a rude day involves any medication at all potentially. EOS 3 0 24 what do you mean be a rude day. EOS 3 1 25 [Others] apologies this was a typo by autocorrect. I meant to say that this would not be a route that involves any medication at all potentially. EOS 3 0 26 ok thanks for explaining. I think I' ll speak to my sister about this. if this doesn' t help I' ll look into making an appointment with the psychologist maybe.. EOS 3 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s great. I think the first step is always the hardest but you come across as someone that is willing to seek help and I believe that if you face into this you can overcome it witht he right support.
0 0 0 Hello. My name is Spike. What is yours? Is anyone there? I feel kind of sad and rejected that no one is answering. Is this part of the task? EOS 0 1 1 [Others] oh no i' m sorry i left you waited. please tell me your problem. EOS 0 0 2 I' m trying to make money on MTurk and starting a YouTube channel. Money is a big concern for me. EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] We are on the same boat. Do you have any other jobs?
5 0 0 im depressed and angry. EOS 5 1 1 [Question] why would you say that? EOS 5 0 2 i really want a drink. EOS 5 1 3 [Question] is there anything I can help you with? EOS 5 0 4 i' m an alcoholic. EOS 5 1 5 [Question] do you think a drink will help you? EOS 5 0 6 Just had a stressful day. depressed because if i go get a beer i wont stop. no i guess it wouldnt. it still sucks. i want to be normal lol. i get that thought in my head and its like i become obsessed. EOS 5 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] why not try to put attention in some other things instead of a beer. EOS 5 0 8 hmmm like what? EOS 5 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] its only in your mind. EOS 5 0 10 i hate my mind. EOS 5 1 11 [Question] like working out? it will give you a lot of benefits especially with your health. you can do it! EOS 5 0 12 i actually was thinking of starting again. i did about 15 min this morning. i used to workout like 2 hours a day lol. thank you. EOS 5 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] oh that' s nice. youre welcome! EOS 5 0 14 i actually just switched from beachbody to les mills. i got bored with beachb body workouts lol. having something different is nice. EOS 5 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] of course you can try different things.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 0 0 1 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am doing great, how about you? EOS 0 0 3 I am doing good. Can I talk to you about something? EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course you can, tell me about it:) EOS 0 0 5 I am worried that I won' t be able to complete my degree. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Why so? EOS 0 0 7 I can' t get motivated, it doesn' t seem worth it. EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Hey I' ve been there too, but it really helped me meditating and going out with nature to clear my mind of things. You should try it! EOS 0 0 9 What do you meditate about? EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Nothing special, just sit in my room in silence. Listen to tutorials on youtube to meditate. They get me relaxed and motivated for the day:) EOS 0 0 11 I feel like I would sit there and worry about things I have not done yet. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s part of meditation! I too worry while meditating, but when i' m listening to the videos and following instructions all those worries go away:) If that doesn' t help you, you can go out in nature to clear your mind off things. Being in the wild really motivates me to continue. EOS 0 0 13 Maybe it will calm me down. Does it make it easier to concentrate?. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Meditating absolutely does since the whole point is to clear your mind off things and concentrate on the task ahead. And the wild? that' s whole other experience because you either concentrate on things or you get mesmerized by nature:)
2 0 0 Good afternoon/ evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you tonight? EOS 2 0 2 Doing great. How about yourself? EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I' m doing well how can I help you tonight? EOS 2 0 4 So, the issue I' m having is work - related. My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He' s also in the middle of testing for CP. My job requires that I be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask... but sometimes the people I am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6 - foot boundary. A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills. My son just turned 2. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you' d wish they wear a mask? EOS 2 0 6 I have. A few people respected my wishes. But one in particular stands out. A gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. He got angry at my request. In my shoes, what would you do? Because I feel like Im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol. EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don' t honor your requests? EOS 2 0 8 It makes me feel trapped. Frustrated. I would never intentionally try to put someone else in harms way and I feel like I don t.* don' t get the same courtesy. I feel frustrated because I' m REQUIRED to deal with people. I work in construction. I feel trapped because, what are my options? Continue to work..... my son gets sick and dies. His pediatrician has already warned me how deadly this could be for me. And if I quit? No money? I have a 5 year old I have to take care of too.. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before I share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue? EOS 2 0 10 I' ve spoken to my boss. He was sympathetic about it all.... At this point I' m not sure what to do. EOS 2 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Alright. Have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less? Or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family? EOS 2 0 12 Those are fairly decent ideas. The struggle for money would still be an issue if I worked part - time. And I doubt I could find a better job at this particular time. With that being said, I didn' t think to see if the boss would let me work in the office for a bit. I know my fellow employees would respect my wishes. Any other suggestions? EOS 2 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] We are going through some really tough times right now and I think that most people are very sympathetic. Especially for those who are in your shoes. Our children are our top priority and seeing them sick hurts us more than anything. How do you feel about talking to your boss about working in the office for a bit until things calm down a little? Do you get paid vacation time in your job? EOS 2 0 14 That sounds like a reasonable thing to do. I do get paid vacation. EOS 2 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Another suggestion that I have is maybe you could take some paid vacation time now rather than later to get away from people for awhile. I know it may not be the most fun time to do it but then you know you' re keeping safe! I' m not sure of all the details on your job so I' m having a hard time making firm suggestions. How would you feel about that?
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed! EOS 7 0 7 And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that' s one method I have used.. Thank you for your trust in me.. EOS 7 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don' t overdo it.. EOS 7 0 9 I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible. true, very true.. Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen? EOS 7 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you.
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? EOS 1 0 22 He' s a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly. EOS 1 0 24 But maybe I deserved it. EOS 1 1 25 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly. EOS 1 0 26 Yes, he did. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No you did not! Please don' t think like that. EOS 1 0 28 I' m just so angry that I could break something. And maybe I will do that! EOS 1 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this. EOS 1 0 30 But what if it doesn' t pass? And I cannot afford therapy. EOS 1 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now. There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free. EOS 1 0 32 I don' t know if I could do that. I don' t like talking about my problems with strangers. EOS 1 1 33 [Self-disclosure] And yet here we are: P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found.. I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that I was.
1 0 0 I' m having issues with my parents. You can say we are having a conflict. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] What kind of issues do you think you are having? EOS 1 0 2 well they won' t allow me to date this girl i met online.. They told she' s bad news. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today. Have you tried talking to you parents about why she is" bad news"? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, i tried but it won' t get through their head. There are so old school. They want me to date someone close to my age. is 15 year difference too big of a gap? EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] The basic problem is that your parents believe that 15 years is too large of an age gap between you guys. Is there any other reasons your parents dissaporve of her? EOS 1 0 6 They told me she' s gold digger. Yes i come from money but hey this girl is the one.. EOS 1 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You believe that the girl is not a gold digger, but instead you guys like each other for who you are. Money is not an issue for you guys? EOS 1 0 8 nope not at all. hmm well she does ask to use my credit card alot. my parents foot the bill.. EOS 1 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps you should try to talk to your parents around this fact. For example, if money is the problem for your parents, you can set some rules. LIke you can set an allowance for how much money you can use each week. EOS 1 0 10 Ok, i will talk to them this weekend. what' s better on the phone or in person? EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you want a better communication, I believe in person will be best.
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one. EOS 4 0 16 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. What else can I do besides meditation? EOS 4 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds? EOS 4 0 18 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. Candles are much better for me. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil. EOS 4 0 20 I haven' t heard of that website before. I' ll have to check it out. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships. EOS 4 0 22 Well, I haven' t been in a long - term relationship like this before.. My past relationships were all in high school, and they only lasted a few weeks or months at a time. I really cared for this one, and we were together for so long. EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] I feel obligated to help during Christmas because I had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts. EOS 4 0 24 You had a fight with your partner? I' m sorry, it' s the worst when people fight over what' s supposed to be something nice. EOS 4 1 25 [Question] What was the fight over? Food? Money? Sex? EOS 4 0 26 I forget what started it, it was something stupid. He didn' t like the way I said something and it kind of blew up from there. We were fighting over the smallest things these last few months. It just kind of built up to the point where he said he couldn' t take fighting with me anymore and just wanted to end it. EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would let things decompress for a long while. EOS 4 0 28 End the relationship, I mean. You think maybe if we just take some time apart, he might want to talk about it? EOS 4 1 29 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest thinking through ending the relationship if he has a hot temper.. EOS 4 0 30 He does get upset very easily. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, just think it through for some time.. EOS 4 0 32 I do think it is important to take some time and breathe. EOS 4 1 33 [Question] Was the relationship with him pleasant for many months? EOS 4 0 34 Yes, for most of our time together it was wonderful. He made me laugh very easily. That' s part of why I' m so sad that he ended the relationship. EOS 4 1 35 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said it has only gotten rough in the last two months? EOS 4 0 36 Two or three, yes. And we would fight over the smallest things, it was really stupid. EOS 4 1 37 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that he has announced to you he has ended the relationship on Christmas? Today, you mean? EOS 4 0 38 Yes, and it was our one year anniversary. We were supposed to order takeout and watch a movie and exchange presents. Instead we fought and broke up. EOS 4 1 39 [Reflection of feelings] In my opinion, I would consider accepting that it is not going to be a healthy relationship whatsoever. EOS 4 0 40 I think you are right. Unless we went to some sort of counseling. But it probably is for the best. EOS 4 1 41 [Self-disclosure] I have seen things only get worse in a situation like yours. I think h needs to accept that he needs to grow up. How old are the both of you? Any other counseling that I can give?
4 0 0 I just lost my job and am worried about paying the bills. EOS 4 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! How are you doing? EOS 0 0 1 im ok kinda stressed. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Anything I can help with:)? Feeling stressed is never fun:( What has been making you feel stressed? EOS 0 0 3 im feeling very overwhelmed and cant get anything done cause i dont know where to start! i want to declutter my house but dont know where to start. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I hear you, feeling overwhelmed and like you don' t know where to start can leave a person feeling stressd forsure! Decluttering sounds like a great idea! Sometimes taking baby steps is a good place to start! EOS 0 0 5 but there are so many thinggs to do and ideas i have. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Of course! It can feel so stressful when we have all these little things we want to do but don' t know where to start! EOS 0 0 7 should i start in one room or one group of things and collect them from all the rooms? EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What is one little area that maybe seems easier to start with? Yeah, that' s a great idea!
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! What can I do to help? EOS 0 0 1 Hello, I' m not sure if there is any help? Without knowing when I can return to work, I will probably remain anxious about the unknown. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m glad to speak to you today. It sounds like you are having anxious thoughts. Can you tell me more? EOS 0 0 3 i am self employed, selling event tickets on the internet, but because of covid, all events are postponed until it is safe to gather in large numbers. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how you might feel anxious. There are lots of uncertainties right now. I am sorry you are going through this. Are you able to find work or help from the government? EOS 0 0 5 thank you; fortunately, i have been able to collect unemployment assistance, especially created for self employed people during this difficult time. however, that is due to expire in a few weeks, so once again i am growing anxious about finances. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Living with uncertainties can make anyone feel anxious. Have you tried getting outdoors for a small walk or hike?. EOS 0 0 7 yes, I try to walk outdoors every day, for at least 30 minutes. it does help a lot. but with the weather turning colder, that may be difficult to continue. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It is so important during stressful life events to take care of our minds and bodies. It sounds like you have been making good choices! Have you reached out to family or friends for advice or perhaps help with supplemental employment? EOS 0 0 9 not yet; it is very difficult for me to ask for help. But I may need to do so in the near future. I am fortunate to have a close network of family and friends that I can count on. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am happy to hear you have support during this time. EOS 0 0 11 i would be open to seeking other employment online; work from home on the computer. any suggestions? EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Luckily, there are many platforms online that allow you to work from home. I know of several that allow you to do side" gigs". Perhaps you can search and find a few of these. I, myself have had success doing these. EOS 0 0 13 thanks! i will check it out. in the meantime, any other suggestions for dealing with anxiety? EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Many have found meditation helps relieve anxiety. Most importantly, if you find yourself feeling depressed or worsening symptoms, please contact your medical professional. EOS 0 0 15 ok will do; thanks again for all the helpful info.. EOS 0 1 16 [Others] It was nice speaking with you today.
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! How are you today? EOS 3 0 2 Ok I guess. I do not know how to tell my husband that I am lonely and I want out of the marriage. EOS 3 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, that sure is a heavy subject and a heavy thing to be on your mind. EOS 3 0 4 He is not one you can talk to he usually just brushes things off. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have tried to discuss your loneliness with your husband before? EOS 3 0 6 Yes he tells me it’s just in my head and I could just go out with him, but he drinks then to much so I do not like going out with him. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] I am sure that is frustrating! Does he drink at home as well or just when you go out? EOS 3 0 8 Just when he goes out I do not go with him I do not drink and drive. And he hangs with some obnoxious people. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Would a date night at home with take - out and a movie just the two of you be an option? EOS 3 0 10 He would go to sleep, and then he thinks I am crazy he says we are no kids anymore that need to go on a date we are married. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you think you both might be open to talking to a marriage counselor? EOS 3 0 12 I want that but I doubt he will talk he tells me he has no problems I have them, and all it does is I doubt myself. I turned this situation in every direction and I just am not able to find a solution. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, what about you finding a counselor for yourself who could help you with your own self - care? Perhaps it could be a start and then he/ she could help you end your marriage if you still want to. It took me awhile to learn my own value and how important self - care is.

EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 I' m good. How about you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Very little to complain about today. What brings you here? EOS 3 0 3 Just want to talk some random stuff basically just want a companion. EOS 3 1 4 [Others] How' s the weather where you are? EOS 3 0 5 Still pretty cold and dry in here, how about there?

EOS 3 0 9 not really I' m living with my family but I don' t really talk to them anymore I' m just in my room all day. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Is it the stress of the pandemic getting to you& your family, or something else? EOS 3 0 11 It' s something else. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Can you share?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello. EOS 2 0 1 Hello I am in need of assistance. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] I am Tom. How can I help you? How are you in need of assistance? EOS 2 0 3 Hello Tom, this is Dillon..

Are you in a trade school? Or in academia? EOS 2 0 5 In college. I started off really well until the pandemic hit. Now my family is struggling financially and it has greatly affected my academics. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Well, I went through a similar situation when a pink - eye breakout hurt my school.... I struggled financially, but took any job I could..... EOS 2 0 7 What kind of jobs did you take? EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Work part - time and go to school part - time. EOS 2 0 9 I' m trying to find a steady job. jobs that can help support both my family and my tuition. EOS 2 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest creating flyers and ask to be a dog walker. Americans love their dogs. 70 Percent of Americans have dogs. EOS 2 0 11 oh okay that' s interesting. there' s a part time job at a local library should I take it? EOS 2 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I feel that you can be great and be a good entrepreneur..... dog walking doesn' t take a lot of talent. EOS 2 0 13 thank you for that. EOS 2 1 14 [Question] How close in the library? EOS 2 0 15 the library is within the campus. EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Ok, that is good. I once worked at a library.

EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps on the interviews you are doing something wrong, because it have been a while. EOS 3 0 12 i feel that i am not worthy and that no one thinks i am capable. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Dont think that. You are worthy, you just need to apply yourself in the right direction:)
4 0 0 I feel sad, and feel like need help. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you identify why you feel sad? EOS 4 0 2 yes, my aunt pass away a couple weeks ago. and since then im feeling really sad.

EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are you with family? Sometimes it helps to be with others who are grieving? EOS 4 0 6 No, I live alone, my family lives in another state. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being by yourself is rough after a death. Can you talk with your family by phone? Do you have a friend who has gone through a similar loss? EOS 4 0 8 I feel like everybody is in their own bussines and have no time to hear my complains. I talk to my family, but the whole family is not doing really fine. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you feel people think you are complaining when you talk about your Aunt' s death making you sad. Is that correct? EOS 4 0 10 yes. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Do you feel you are complaining?
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere.

3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 2 Feeling depressed as usual. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 4 Everything. Life. It' s awful. How many years do you really need to stop enjoying this place. Ya know what I mean. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand, but just to make sure I know what is going on fully, you are depressed in general and don' t know how to get through it.. EOS 3 0 6 I would say that is fairly accurate. Often times, I wish an asteroid would come down and begin the apocolypse.. Something to break up the routine. Don' t you find life utterly boring and repetitive?. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Just from these few messages, I can tell you are extremely upset about this.. I have had problems in the past with depression as well, I used to have severe anxiety as well..
2 0 0 how can i find a jobs in my area. What kind of jobs open right now. EOS 2 1 1 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried the classified ads?

EOS 2 0 4 I don' t have resume. EOS 2 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest you type one up, most employers want an application and a resume. EOS 2 0 6 I will need somebody type one for me. EOS 2 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps a friend can help you, if not they have programs on the web to help assist with that.

EOS 2 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Then perhaps you should look for part time work. EOS 2 0 16 No, I have to stay with him, he can not go to school. EOS 2 1 17 [Question] I am a little confused. Are you looking for employment or not?
1 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 1 0 1 I am just a little angry. My mother and I had another blow - up. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother? EOS 1 0 3 It is why I am angry. This occurs at least every other day. I say something harmless and she thinks I am saying it in a way that is rude or something. EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you can figure out a way to communicate better. EOS 1 0 5 I do not know for sure where to start. If I try to tell her that is not what I mean it is like she doesn' t understand? EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to feel misunderstood. EOS 1 0 7 For example today I was just saying I like the food she had cooked us for supper. She took that to mean I never liked the food she made before. She says I do not appreciate her and I should be grateful to have her. EOS 1 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing your best to be nice but it isn' t getting through. EOS 1 0 9 Maybe it was the way she was brought up that she is so sensitive. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everybody has stuff from their past that affects them. EOS 1 0 11 But they should not take how they feel on others right? But I know I have to be understanding. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You should be understanding, especially since you already know this. EOS 1 0 13 Can you relate to this situation? EOS 1 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have had personal disputes with my parents in the past. Most of the time there' s other things going on that makes a person act different. EOS 1 0 15 Maybe I could just take deep breath and kind of step back a minute before I respond. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It would be good to do that. Maybe try to have a conversation and tell her you support her no matter what she' s going through. EOS 1 0 17 I guess the best time to do that was when she is in a very good mood. EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do some chores or something that helps her out and just let her know you want to have a serious talk some time.
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you doing? EOS 1 0 1 Hi, I' m ok. How are you? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] Not bad, it' s a peaceful night. Anything in particular you' d like to talk about? EOS 1 0 3 That' s great. My job refused my request to continue to work from home. So I was pretty much forced to go into a school where the cases are growing. EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I imagine that' s very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being? EOS 1 0 5 Just to make sure I' m wearing my mask, washing my hands, and social distancing. Which is not enough. There are more and more teachers getting infected and I just feel it a matter of time before it my turn.. I fear that I will bring this home to my family and I will not survive it. I have pre existing conditions. EOS 1 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry that you' re having to deal with such stressful circumstances. You can only control what you can control. Have you discussed these concerns with the school and explained the preexisting conditions? I get it though. It' s scary for everyone at this point. EOS 1 0 7 Yes I have explained to my principal, my team, and got a note from my Rheumatologist. EOS 1 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems to me that they should take that information into consideration.
5 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling today? EOS 5 0 1 uninspired. broken. a rock. a static object. bananas. EOS 5 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, that' s a start. Do I hear you saying that you' re confused at the moment? EOS 5 0 3 not confused. frustrated that I have to produce art for marks when I am not inspired. EOS 5 1 4 [Question] Ah I hear you, education can be both wonderful and difficult can' t it? What are you supposed to produce?
3 1 0 [Greeting] hello!! EOS 3 0 1 I am very depressed. I found out that my girlfriend is cheating on me with my friend! EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] that' s really bad. even I was also in the same situation. EOS 3 0 3 I have been with her for close to 2 years and now she has been cheating me right under my nose for the past few months! how foolish of me to blindly trust her... How did you deal with it? EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] To be honest i was not completely came out it since it was 3 years but now i somehow getting better i tried to divert myself from the thoughts engage myself with other friends spend more time with my family like that. try to divert yourself, keep yourself busy, spend more time with family, try to minimize the usage of mobile.

EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] yeah I could understand your feelings right now. EOS 3 0 7 I actually broke my phone in anger and damaged her credit card. I feel like slapping both of them so hard that they forget where they came from! but I can' t do anything. I am helpless. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah its really hard to handle this state of mind but we need to. EOS 3 0 9 Why are girls like this? EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t know but some girls were playing with a guys intense feelings.
6 0 0 I am having a really hard time with something that I did to my boyfriend. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Do you want to talk about it? EOS 6 0 2 Yes, thank you! I was with him since childhood and we are actually still together. I slipped up one night and hate to admit what I did. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you' re holding onto a lot of guilt about this incident. Are you comfortable talking about that night? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, it is intense guilt. I can' t think of anything else. I hate to tell you but I cheated on him. I am so sorry and can' t look at myself in the mirror. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That can really weigh you down, beating yourself up with guilt. Does he know about the incident? EOS 6 0 6 I feel like I am worthless and I don' t deserve to ever be happy or laugh again. I really do love him and I don' t ever want him to find out what I did. Yes, I cant stop beating myself up. He doesn' t know what I did but he is little suspicious. EOS 6 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You definitely deserve to laugh and be happy. One mistake doesn' t define you! EOS 6 0 8 Thank you! A long time ago his sister told me that he cheated on me and I believed her and so I wanted to get him back. EOS 6 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It says a lot about your character that you feel badly about this, that you can see and recognize you acted in a way you don' t agree with. That' s something to build on. That desire to" get even" is definitely understandable.
1 1 0 [Question] hi. how can i help you? EOS 1 0 1 hi. i am really angry. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] are you saying that you are angry now? what happened dear?

EOS 1 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] just remember, yesterday is gone. there is really nothing you can do about the situation. you better keep your distance from that particular person. EOS 1 0 9 ok. and i already keep my distance from him. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] learn from your mistake and don' t do it again dear. EOS 1 0 11 yes i won' t. funny thing is he didn' t remember what he did that night. EOS 1 1 12 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah. we can' t control others. right? EOS 1 0 13 absolutely. EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes. it totally depends on how mature the person is. just forgive him and keep in mind for next time whether you should share something with him or not.

3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 3 0 2 well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. My life is done now. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband. EOS 3 0 4 well, I cannot say it is a new start when I will be 90 in March. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Then you' ve definitely got a lot going for you if you' re 90! EOS 3 0 6 Had. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Why did he leave you? EOS 3 0 8 He wanted a younger woman. His new girlfriend is 63. He is 45. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that is more of his problem then. You deserve someone that' s better than leaving someone because of their age.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:) EOS 2 0 7 It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am in the UK. It' s sort of a grey area... police won' t really do anything but you can' t buy it over the counter. EOS 2 0 9 One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I' m very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially. EOS 2 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot. The US seems to be really strict on it tho. EOS 2 0 11 It varies, state by state, depending on which party is governing. Which you of course have a version of in the UK. Mayoral elections were today yeah? EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] They were but I didn' t pay much attention:) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that' s all. EOS 2 0 13 Oh, well, I' m sorry to hear that. I think participation in local governance is actually the most achievable path for change, but perhaps how it' s structured where you are, it wouldn' t really matter much if you participated. I guess mayorals are only technically local, not like parliamentary elections. EOS 2 1 14 [Others] If I were in London or a major city I' d vote for Mayor. I am in a rural area and we don' t have one: D. I vote for local councillors tho. EOS 2 0 15 Oh, I take it to mean that you are anti - Khan? If you feel like you' d need to vote for mayor in London. EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I like Khan:) EOS 2 0 17 Jeremy Corbyn, no surrender? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I like him too lol. EOS 2 0 19 You sound like someone I' d like to smoke a spliff with In a moderated manner of course, in relevance to the topic I opened with. EOS 2 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] But I don' t get to vote for London mayor. Only if I were a London resident or nearby would I( sorry for tortured syntax) EOS 2 0 21 Prescriptive grammar is fascism, use whatever words in whatever order you like. Ironic given that I just watched My Fair Lady the other day. EOS 2 1 22 [Self-disclosure] Haha I don' t indulge these days, except for once in a blue moon: P. EOS 2 0 23 You' ve got those weird drug shops in the UK, with synthetics and all that. EOS 2 1 24 [Self-disclosure] Not where I am:( All we have here is sheep and cows. EOS 2 0 25 Let me guess - north/ eastern UK? EOS 2 1 26 [Self-disclosure] North West but close:)
3 1 0 [Question] Good afternoon how may I help you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello there. I' m suffering with increased depression and I' m not quite clear why. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately? EOS 3 0 3 No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that' s the same for everyone. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression? EOS 3 0 5 I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I' ve always had a low mood but now I' m anxious that it will continue to get worse. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again? EOS 3 0 7 Since lockdown haven' t spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don' t want this to get any worse. What if she isn' t available?. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It wouldn' t hurt to try and reach out. If she isn' t available, there are other services. EOS 3 0 9 What like support groups etc? I' m also sure this isn' t just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It' s weird and a little concerning to be honest. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app. EOS 3 0 11 I hadn' t thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it' s worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn' t available. Sometimes its good to have options. EOS 3 0 13 I' ll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues?. EOS 3 1 14 [Self-disclosure] After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety. It wasn' t until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it.
0 0 0 Hello my situation is that I' m facing an enormous amount of academic pressure. EOS 0 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello. Academic work can be overwhelming at times. I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though. Could you tell me what the issue is in particular? EOS 0 0 2 It' s just a huge amount of work that I' m struggling with and a ton of exams and they give me a lot of anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming. Make sure that you try to be as prepared as you can. When you feel capable of doing well on said exams, you will feel a lot less pressure. EOS 0 0 4 Do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though? EOS 0 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have an academic councelor you can talk to? EOS 0 0 6 yes it' s all virtual though. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well at least is something. I am sure talking to someone who might be able to guide you academically will be a significant relief.. EOS 0 0 8 That is a good idea. Do you personally recommend anything on how to balance my schedule and still be able to have my time to do other things? EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] When I was at college, I usually aimed at 2 hours of studying everyday(+ homework) and I also aimed to have at least 2 hours of leisure time.
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 hello. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 0 0 3 I need ways alleviate stress while studying. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there. EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck. EOS 0 0 7 How did you push past that job? EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work. EOS 0 0 9 Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career? EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too. EOS 0 0 11 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Can you give me some more details? EOS 0 0 13 I just find the work mundane and way too remedial. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable. EOS 0 0 15 did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job? EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have you a few, there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit. EOS 0 0 17 what types of skill can I gain online? EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Indeed is one of the better ones to look for jobs, honestly I would suggest looking at jobs that you normally wouldn' t and see what kind of qualifications they need and see if you can get that done online. EOS 0 0 19 so filter based on my absolute needs and go for online skills that I can complete? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes I think that is a great idea, look for jobs that meet your needs and figure out what you can do to look attractive to employers. EOS 0 0 21 I have tried glassdoor before, have you had any luck there? EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used it a bit, I mainly used indeed. EOS 0 0 23 and have you showcased your skills using LinkedIn before? I have had that one recommended to me before, they said its a great way to neatly organize accomplishments and personal background. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes especially if you are applying for anything in a professional setting that is very important. EOS 0 0 25 do you have any examples of online skills you completed? EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] coursera has a lot of great courses, it really depends on what you are looking for. EOS 0 0 27 if I was looking to enter the engineering field, any recommendations? EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Is that what you are going to school for? EOS 0 0 29 yes but I may change my mind. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] What year are you in? most engineering programs have a practicum and that is a great opportunity to make contacts and potentially get offered a job.
0 0 0 Hello. My name is Spike. What is yours? Is anyone there? I feel kind of sad and rejected that no one is answering. Is this part of the task? EOS 0 1 1 [Others] oh no i' m sorry i left you waited. please tell me your problem. EOS 0 0 2 I' m trying to make money on MTurk and starting a YouTube channel. Money is a big concern for me. EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] We are on the same boat. Do you have any other jobs? EOS 0 0 4 No. That' s my only income right now. It has led to a real crisis of self confidence to me. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you considered applying for a job or trying uber drive/ eats? EOS 0 0 6 I have. But I have health conditions that would mean Covid - 19 would be very risky for me to get. So, I' m trying to work online. I' m trying to stay encouraged. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand how you feel, it' s tough not being able to work and earn much money. However, you are doing your best right now and should feel proud of yourself. EOS 0 0 8 Thanks. I appreciate that. What do you do to stay encouraged or confident? EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I try to spend more time outdoor and keep myself busy. I like to cook since it' s very relaxing and helps keep my mind concentrated. EOS 0 0 10 cooking for me is just another chore. But getting outside might help. I live out in the country. So I have nice scenery. EOS 0 1 11 [Others] That is perfect then, the nature is very healing. You can also hang out with friends and talk to them about how you feel. EOS 0 0 12 It has been days since I even sat on the porch. And weeks since I took a walk. EOS 0 1 13 [Others] you should definitely do that. staying indoor will worsen your mentality.
1 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 1 0 1 I am just a little angry. My mother and I had another blow - up. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother? EOS 1 0 3 It is why I am angry. This occurs at least every other day. I say something harmless and she thinks I am saying it in a way that is rude or something. EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you can figure out a way to communicate better. EOS 1 0 5 I do not know for sure where to start. If I try to tell her that is not what I mean it is like she doesn' t understand? EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to feel misunderstood. EOS 1 0 7 For example today I was just saying I like the food she had cooked us for supper. She took that to mean I never liked the food she made before. She says I do not appreciate her and I should be grateful to have her. EOS 1 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing your best to be nice but it isn' t getting through. EOS 1 0 9 Maybe it was the way she was brought up that she is so sensitive. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everybody has stuff from their past that affects them. EOS 1 0 11 But they should not take how they feel on others right? But I know I have to be understanding. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You should be understanding, especially since you already know this. EOS 1 0 13 Can you relate to this situation? EOS 1 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have had personal disputes with my parents in the past. Most of the time there' s other things going on that makes a person act different. EOS 1 0 15 Maybe I could just take deep breath and kind of step back a minute before I respond. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It would be good to do that. Maybe try to have a conversation and tell her you support her no matter what she' s going through. EOS 1 0 17 I guess the best time to do that was when she is in a very good mood. EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do some chores or something that helps her out and just let her know you want to have a serious talk some time. EOS 1 0 19 But what if she thinks me helping her out is criticizing the way she does things? That seems like the way she would be. EOS 1 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try giving reassurance that you want to show you care. EOS 1 0 21 I will try this. It is worth a shot. We can' t go through life being upset at each other. EOS 1 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] I feel the same way. I hope you can get things on better terms. EOS 1 0 23 I appreciated the help. I was just so upset. I didn' t want to talk to anyone in our family and have them take sides or make them uncomfortable. EOS 1 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you can set a better example about being open. EOS 1 0 25 I will try to say things that don' t sound confrontational from now on. EOS 1 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I believe in you. EOS 1 0 27 Thank you for the believing in me. Thank you for your help. EOS 1 1 28 [Greeting] You are welcome, best wishes.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, what brings you to seek support, today? EOS 4 0 1 I am having ongoing depression. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin? EOS 4 0 3 I have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It first began a couple of weeks ago. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I am sad and anxious about the coronavirus. I miss seeing my friends and family. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you must really care about your friends and family, and this awful pandemic is prevent your from seeing them.
0 1 0 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hello, How are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 am fine. at least for now. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] would you like to talk about it? EOS 0 0 3 yeah... i have not been able to meet with my boyfriend physically due to the corona lockdown, and when i finally got to see him last month i discovered that he is cheating on me. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am so sorry that you had to go through that, I know this is a very difficult time for you. Has your boyfriend reached out to you at all to clarify things or to see if you are okay? EOS 0 0 5 he has but it is not sounding convincing enough. i feel so hurt. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Just By chatting with you, I can feel how hurt and upset you are. Is there anyone that can provide you support at home during this time? EOS 0 0 7 there is nobody i can talk to about this, i dont really have friends and my siblings are busy with their lives. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] This is a very challenging time for you especially when there is lack of support. I do feel your pain, And I would like to share some advise and suggestions which may alleviate some of the hurt and pain you are going through. Would you e open to hear them out?
2 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you feeling today? EOS 2 0 1 Hi. I' m feeling okayish. EOS 2 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest. EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely. I recently broke up with my girlfriend. We had been together for more than 3 years. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] What happened that made you guys break up? EOS 2 0 5 She said that she simply wasn' t in love anymore, and that she didn' t have the same feelings she did at the beginning. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have also had this situation happen to me. Maybe it just wasn' t the right timing or she had other interests. EOS 2 0 7 She was so important for me. I feel so empty.... I Feel like I' m never finding anyone like her ever again, EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I' ve had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life. EOS 2 0 9 It' s easier said than done. At times I would rather maybe just dissapear. I have never had anyone else show romantic interest in me before. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] What is your age? EOS 2 0 11 I am 25 at the moment. EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] You still have your whole life ahead of you. Some people don' t find a partner until their 40' s or even 50' s. When I left my ex I found this guy that I truly fell in love with. He is still sulking in his living room. I told him that if he didn' t move one that he wouldnt get anywhere in life. I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what I would want him to do and I think thats what your girl would want you to do as well. EOS 2 0 13 I disagree with you regarding that maybe that is what she wants me to do. I don' t think she cares about me at the slightest anymore. I was a burden for her and will probably keep being it for any woman I meet. EOS 2 1 14 [Question] Did she give you any reasons to why she wasn' t in love anymore? EOS 2 0 15 I think she wasn' t feeling physically attracted to me anymore. EOS 2 1 16 [Question] Did you ever think she maybe possibly has been cheating? EOS 2 0 17 I could not say for sure. But I surely think she wouldn' t cheat on me. EOS 2 1 18 [Others] Has she ever tried to hide text messages, lock her phone, or tell you she is too busy to come over? EOS 2 0 19 Actually, In the past few months she has kinda freaked out everytime I tried to get her phone for her. As if she didn' t want me to see something. EOS 2 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Im sorry that this stressful for you. In my past, I have had exes do that to me. Most likely she was cheating on you and this was the reason for her motives. EOS 2 0 21 I can' t believe she would do something like that... I really need to confront her about it. I can' t have this doubt on my chest. EOS 2 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would definitely confront her about it. I wouldn' t get angry or fight about it. Maybe she if she has a new boyfriend already. That is a really good indicator. EOS 2 0 23 You are right. I need to take this slowly and calmly. EOS 2 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would calmly ask her. She will most likely deny it. But, some ofher friends may already know about this. If she says she did, ask her if there was something you did wrongthat made her do it. Sometimes its not even the Cheatee. Sometimes they just do it for no good reason.
5 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 5 0 1 am fine thank you. EOS 5 1 2 [Question] Is there anything that you would like to talk about? EOS 5 0 3 no, now am okay. EOS 5 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well I am happy to listen to any problems that you have. EOS 5 0 5 problem with cowoorkers but i solved. EOS 5 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, can you tell me about it anyway? I am happy to listen. Do feel free to talk:) EOS 5 0 7 we had agree with them work to do and date to submit it to me, but unfortunately their fail to do so. EOS 5 1 8 [Question] Are you still working at that place? EOS 5 0 9 YES I AM. EOS 5 1 10 [Question] There is no need to shout. Is there anything else you' d like to talk about? Bearing in mind that you are not going to be paid for this HIT unless you actually make an effort. EOS 5 0 11 NO AM DONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN. EOS 5 1 12 [Others] I think you have not put any real effort into completing this HIT.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello there, can I help you with any today?* anything. I am happy to talk to you about any problem that you might be having? EOS 4 0 1 I am having such a difficult time today!!! EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you. EOS 4 0 3 I think that my boyfriend is cheating on me again!!! EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Are you saying that he has cheated on you before? That does not sound very promising. EOS 4 0 5 He has but it was a long time ago and was before we had a talk about exclusivity in our relationship but it still hurt. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Have you considered getting some sort of couples counselling? Or do you just think that he is never going to change? EOS 4 0 7 We tried counselling once.. It was online and we got paid to do it.. I don' t think he took it seriously at the time. He always said he felt like he was being attacked. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. So you feel that he is not really taking your problems as a couple seriously? EOS 4 0 9 Yes. I feel he thinks of me as some sort of trophy and he does not have to work now that he won me over in the first place. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have been in toxic relationships before and to be honest it does sound a little as though this is one of those situations. EOS 4 0 11 I have been as well but this time was supposed to be different. At first everything was great but now things are so distant I just don' t know what to do next. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you feel that perhaps it might be time to move on? People who will cheat twice are pretty unlikely to ever change their ways.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:) EOS 2 0 7 It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am in the UK. It' s sort of a grey area... police won' t really do anything but you can' t buy it over the counter. EOS 2 0 9 One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I' m very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially. EOS 2 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot. The US seems to be really strict on it tho. EOS 2 0 11 It varies, state by state, depending on which party is governing. Which you of course have a version of in the UK. Mayoral elections were today yeah? EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] They were but I didn' t pay much attention:) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that' s all.
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing. EOS 6 0 8 Yeah, people don' t know that just because my two friends go" Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two( so - called) friends? EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] definatly not... have you tried explaining your situation to them? EOS 6 0 10 No, they don' t know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID - 19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time? EOS 6 0 12 I might be able to do that. EOS 6 1 13 [Others] unfortunatly it is right now very comen this situation, so no shame for that, EOS 6 0 14 Well, I used to donate a LOT in year' s past. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] a lot of times donating time to help organisatiosn is more valuable then money. EOS 6 0 16 Great point. EOS 6 1 17 [Others] times and situations change so thats ok. EOS 6 0 18 My friends may like to know that I am trading time.... instead of donating money. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i worked for a non profit and the biggest struggle was to find volunteers to help out. EOS 6 0 20 Yes, you make a good point. EOS 6 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I feel that is a great donation and if they do not like that tell them money is easy to give time not. EOS 6 0 22 The proble is that some people just want to shame people without knowing their plight. EOS 6 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, true, we need to stay above them then in all actuality we don' t know what goes on behind closed doors in their life. sometimes people like that reflect.
4 0 0 hi. hello!!??!!?? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] hello. EOS 4 0 2 hi. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I apologize I was having a sneezing fit! What is on your mind today?

EOS 4 0 6 i hear ya. just bought some claritin this morning for allergies. I agree. at least she is responding to the treatments in the hospital. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That' s great to hear she is responding! EOS 4 0 8 I was happy to hear it too. I' ve been extra careful not to get it cuz of my parents. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] ah, are they elderly or have a weakened immune system? EOS 4 0 10 elderly. dads doctor told me not to meet friends in person cuz i could pass it onto him. EOS 4 1 11 [Others] gotcha. you must live with them to help them out! EOS 4 0 12 i sure do. thing is people my age are getting very sick with it too. and some elderly are not. so i could be helping myself more than my dad. EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] mine are in another state so i don' t have to worry about my behavior. you are right though, anyone can get it... i should probably be more careful myself. EOS 4 0 14 yes absolutely. never know. its a weird virus. best to keep immune system high which i have been. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] i have increased my vitamins i admit. have you as well? EOS 4 0 16 yes and started taking airborne for vitamin c. EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s great! EOS 4 0 18 Thank ya. I worry about my other relatives out of state. EOS 4 1 19 [Others] i am hoping it all ends soon... i miss how things used to be. EOS 4 0 20 me too. i feel like im living in a bubble lol. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i think we all worry about outofstate relatives. mine are all out of state... the holidays will be hard. lol living in a bubble wrap bubble! EOS 4 0 22 I hear ya. We just have to hope for the best. I already made thanksgiving meal yesterday for my dad and dog. They both slept after eating turkey lol. yeah for real lol tons of bubbles in bubble wrap. EOS 4 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] very true.. just keep on keeping on!:) EOS 4 0 24 exactly. ive been shopping since covid. its very theraputic actually. cheaper than a shrink lol. EOS 4 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes.... but my recycling pile has gottene out of hand with amazon boxes. oops lol. EOS 4 0 26 oh no lol i hear ya. lol shopping can be addictive. EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] a lot of things can be addictive! EOS 4 0 28 like chocolate - which i have a stash of - woops lol. EOS 4 1 29 [Reflection of feelings] haha. EOS 4 0 30 lol. EOS 4 1 31 [Question] anything else you want to talk about? EOS 4 0 32 nope im good. thanks for talking with me! EOS 4 1 33 [Affirmation and Reassurance] have a good day!
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 I' m sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What happened?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 I am well, thanks for asking. I am doing some studying and taking a break now. Just to talk about some of the feelings, thoughts, and stresses. The big thing on my mind now is the pandemic. And it' s the start of the second wave in my city.. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand what you are going though, indeed it is tough times. EOS 3 0 4 yeah it sure has been since March this year for my city. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So tell me, what are you going through your mind regarding the pandemic and the second wave? EOS 3 0 6 There' s kind of a lag as I am on the East Coast. So the cases didn' t really show up for the second wave until this month, only sporadically last month. But we were doing now until about two to three weeks ago. well fear, anxiety. worries, and also anger that people are being foolish and complacent, especially the youth groups that go to gyms and restaurants a lot, or to gatherings. even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, I don' t know and it just boggles on my mind.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I understand, I' m from the east coast and I' m deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown. EOS 3 0 8 I get that there' s a fatigue but I was there and I had that fatigue and I got over that a few months ago late summer when I tried to reason myself that it was safe to go out when there weren' t any cases then, as the first w ave was gone from my city. I see. Yeah I feel you definitely. like people are becoming impatient but this is not the right time to be. If I can overcome that initial impatience, others should also. If they have no right reason to be out except for work and personal business, then I don' t think they should be doing that too much.. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I think those who are aware of the situation should follow the rules and be aware. We really can' t change the situation because it human nature. EOS 3 0 10 it is. And that' s sad but true. It' s in our nature, as you say. It' s in our nature to destroy and to consume, etc. unfortunate but I can only cope by doing what I feel is right, and continue to do so. and not compromise my values along with others. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] However, we shouldn' t let it affect us physically, spiritually and most importantly mentally. We need stay relax and be aware of whats going on and believe that by following the rules we are doing our part in reducing the speard.
4 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling really sad and lonely right now. My boyfriend and I broke up and it was me who wanted it but now I regret breaking up and he doesn' t want me back. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, I can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it' s too late. EOS 4 0 3 That is exactly it. I broke up with him because I liked another person but then quickly realized that I made a mistake and it' s too late. I want him back should I start calling and going to his house to beg? EOS 4 1 4 [Question] nobody knows him better than you do, right now I do not think he is in a good place either since it wasn' t his choice to end it, how do you think he would react if you started pressuring him?. EOS 4 0 5 I haven' t really thought of that yet. He has a pretty short temper actually. I know he is really mad at me so I think he might want to yell at me and get his anger out before he could start being nice to me again. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this, perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel, without pressuring him into a response. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah, that' s true. I have been secretly watching his social media and he has girls asking him out and I don' t want to let them get to him before I can get him back. I want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] you can always ask him calmly if he would like to talk, so you both have a chance to express your feelings in a safe way, with no yelling or arguing, do you think that' s something he would do? EOS 4 0 9 I can try that, I think he might be responsive at first if I dont set him off. All of his friends hate me so I have nobody on my side right now. Should I try to get his friends to like me again? Is that an way I could use to get him to want me again? EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] nobody likes to see that one' s friend is sad because of someone else, I think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back. EOS 4 0 11 I can understand what you mean. I need to think this through. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] what made you like someone else in the first place? EOS 4 0 13 Well, we are in a small town and he was popular and the cutest guy in our town. I liked being with someone so popular. He wasn' t always nice to me and is why I wanted to be with someone else for a short time. He used to leave me at parties and go off with his friends sometimes. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] was it a common thing that he didn' t give you the attention you wanted? EOS 4 0 15 My friends always said that I could do better and that he didn' t deserve me. He gave me statis in our town and everyone wanted to be his girlfriend so I think I liked the attention, yes. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] were you happy with him or were you happy that you were with the popular guy? EOS 4 0 17 I really liked being with the popular guy who everyone looked up to. My parents don' t like him at all and have wanted us to break up the whole time we were together. EOS 4 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] it sounds to me like you liked the title more than the feeling of being with him, reflecting on your time together, would you do that again?
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you.
4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out. EOS 4 0 6 I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night? EOS 4 0 8 I can' t sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it' s typically late afternoon. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds like you are doing the very best you can under difficult circumstances. you should feel very proud about that. EOS 4 0 10 thank you. i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] it sounds to me that your sleep issue is really weighing on your mind. you may be setting yourself up for sleep issues by thinking about this so much. is that possible? EOS 4 0 12 yes it may be. i' m not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you' re under a lot of pressure. it' s only natural that you would feel overwhelmed. dont be hard on yourself. you' re doing the best you can. EOS 4 0 14 thank you. that is very supportive. i just dont know how to make the next ten days go by faster. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can spend some time doing pleasant things. it is true that time seems to go fast when we' re having fun.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello. EOS 2 0 1 Hello I am in need of assistance. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] I am Tom. How can I help you? How are you in need of assistance? EOS 2 0 3 Hello Tom, this is Dillon.. I haven' t been doing well in my academics. EOS 2 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I have a real talent to provide guidance to people out there in the World. Not doing well in college or high school? Are you in a trade school? Or in academia? EOS 2 0 5 In college. I started off really well until the pandemic hit. Now my family is struggling financially and it has greatly affected my academics. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Well, I went through a similar situation when a pink - eye breakout hurt my school.... I struggled financially, but took any job I could..... EOS 2 0 7 What kind of jobs did you take? EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Work part - time and go to school part - time. EOS 2 0 9 I' m trying to find a steady job. jobs that can help support both my family and my tuition. EOS 2 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest creating flyers and ask to be a dog walker. Americans love their dogs. 70 Percent of Americans have dogs. EOS 2 0 11 oh okay that' s interesting. there' s a part time job at a local library should I take it? EOS 2 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I feel that you can be great and be a good entrepreneur..... dog walking doesn' t take a lot of talent. EOS 2 0 13 thank you for that. EOS 2 1 14 [Question] How close in the library?
1 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 1 0 1 I am just a little angry. My mother and I had another blow - up. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother? EOS 1 0 3 It is why I am angry. This occurs at least every other day. I say something harmless and she thinks I am saying it in a way that is rude or something. EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you can figure out a way to communicate better. EOS 1 0 5 I do not know for sure where to start. If I try to tell her that is not what I mean it is like she doesn' t understand? EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to feel misunderstood. EOS 1 0 7 For example today I was just saying I like the food she had cooked us for supper. She took that to mean I never liked the food she made before. She says I do not appreciate her and I should be grateful to have her. EOS 1 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing your best to be nice but it isn' t getting through.
0 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I am good, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m doing well, but it could have been better. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] What seems to be bothering you tonight? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, my boy friend of 3 years has refused to take our relationship to the next level and I' m kind of getting tired, I don' t want to play games anymore. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don' t feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,. EOS 0 0 6 exactly, I hate to feel that I' m wasting my time. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand that, as I was in a long term relationship and I felt as though my girlfriend at the time did not want to take things to the next step and I was not happy about it..
1 0 0 Hello I am having pro\ blems with a friend. EOS 1 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so so sorry to hear that. What has been going on? EOS 1 0 2 Sometimes she is very friendly, but sometimes she is super rude. In a way that is so rude that it has never happened before by someone who I consider a friend. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh wow, it sounds like shes not a very good frined.
3 1 0 [Question] Good afternoon how may I help you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello there. I' m suffering with increased depression and I' m not quite clear why. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately? EOS 3 0 3 No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that' s the same for everyone. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression? EOS 3 0 5 I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I' ve always had a low mood but now I' m anxious that it will continue to get worse. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again? EOS 3 0 7 Since lockdown haven' t spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don' t want this to get any worse. What if she isn' t available?. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It wouldn' t hurt to try and reach out. If she isn' t available, there are other services.
0 0 0 hey. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m good, busy. I need another job to pay more bills. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having a difficult time with your finances. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 yes somewhat. i can pay it off within 2 - 3 years without a second job. id like to pay it off faster though. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure it will take dedication and hard work, but I bet you can do it! EOS 0 0 6 I think so. Im doing mturk for a second job right now. it helps some. i don' t know about getting another job. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been in your shoes and also feel that' s a good way to add a little extra income. It can really add up if left to built and used towards a specific goal. EOS 0 0 8 I agree 100%. Been spending it on new clothes and toiletries lately to stock up for the covid shutdown. the extra money helps alot. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It definitely can help. Perhaps you could have a separate way of using some of the money to go towards some of the other bills you would like to pay off? Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns. EOS 0 0 10 i currently do that. it' s hard to have the patience to pay it off. i hate having debt hanging over my head. i like to have nice things though and they cost money. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Yes, and I have found this can be a good way to provide for the extra luxuries we like, without taking away from money that' s used towards household bills. EOS 0 0 12 absolutely. i make sure all of my household bills are paid every month. i think it will get better once these debts are paid off. i needed a lot of new things at once since the old had worn out. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to use some of the scripts that can be added that allows you to catch hits that are hard to get on Mturk? They can be very helpful. Also, there are forums that have all kinds of useful information for workers.

Do you know what is causing you to feel that way? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I recently lost my childhood best friend to covid 19. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can only imagine how sad you feel from losing your best friend. Hopefully chatting some will help. I know in the past when I lost someone it was nice to just have a conversation to help put my mind at ease. EOS 0 0 5 Sure. I feel so lonely sometimes because we were very close. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that you are feeling lonely. Did you have any mutual friends with your best friend that you can reach out to? I am sure they are feeling the same way and it could help both of you to talk to each other and share stories.
3 0 0 I am feeling depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about your feelings? EOS 3 0 2 I feel lost and lonely, i do not know what to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] When did these feelings come about. EOS 3 0 4 They came about when i lost my job in August of this year. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can understand where your coming from with that, especially since this pandemic occurred. EOS 3 0 6 Yes, finances have especially been very tight. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] it seems like this could be overwhelming to you and trying to figure out the right path to go forward. EOS 3 0 8 It is, have you ever encountered such a situation in your life? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I can relate to you in this situation 100% and if it wasnt for me stepping out on faith and opening my own practice, I wouldnt be here now. EOS 3 0 10 How did you snap out of the situation, did you have some savings? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Always putting money aside when able, and doing lots of research about first time businesses gave a lot of insights. Have you tried to look into things like that yourself? EOS 3 0 12 Yes, i have been researching a lot too but it is difficult given that i have been surviving on the savings i had. Also it is very difficult to get a loan currently. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] That I do understand as well. This pandemic has made it hard for everyone. Are you a parent with any little ones by chance? EOS 3 0 14 Yes, i have two children, 5 and 9 year olds. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] So here is some information that I have in my files to help others during this time. There is self - help. org that is labeled as being a self help during these times.

Also try to google" How to become a first time business owner" and see if any of this information helps you and your family..

4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one.

EOS 4 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds? EOS 4 0 18 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. Candles are much better for me. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil. EOS 4 0 20 I haven' t heard of that website before. I' ll have to check it out. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships. EOS 4 0 22 Well, I haven' t been in a long - term relationship like this before.. My past relationships were all in high school, and they only lasted a few weeks or months at a time. I really cared for this one, and we were together for so long. EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] I feel obligated to help during Christmas because I had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts. EOS 4 0 24 You had a fight with your partner? I' m sorry, it' s the worst when people fight over what' s supposed to be something nice. EOS 4 1 25 [Question] What was the fight over? Food? Money? Sex? EOS 4 0 26 I forget what started it, it was something stupid. He didn' t like the way I said something and it kind of blew up from there. We were fighting over the smallest things these last few months. It just kind of built up to the point where he said he couldn' t take fighting with me anymore and just wanted to end it. EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would let things decompress for a long while.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 I' m good. How about you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Very little to complain about today. What brings you here? EOS 3 0 3 Just want to talk some random stuff basically just want a companion. EOS 3 1 4 [Others] How' s the weather where you are?
0 0 0 hey. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m good, busy. I need another job to pay more bills. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having a difficult time with your finances. Is that correct?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hi, I feel really sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am sorry. What is going on? EOS 4 0 3 My friends won' t hang out with me. I am alone all the time. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel like they don' t want to be around you and have nobody to talk to? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, but also just no one to hang out with. I am a loner. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] You prefer it that way?. EOS 4 0 7 No. I want to hang out with people. EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I follow you. It is hard to see people outside of usual social circles right now with the pandemic going on. Out of curiosity tell me what you like doing with others? EOS 4 0 9 I like to talk with them, listen to their stories, just hang out have a good time.. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that. I have not seem my own friends for almost a year because of COVID - 19. It felt isolated and lonely. EOS 4 0 11 What do you do to feel better? EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It has not been easy but I focused on myself. I started doing more exercise and weight lifting. I took up learning how to invest money, and I also got into the habit of reading. Basically I build myself up in body, wallet, and mind so I feel better about myself progressively. It worked well for me at least. What do you think might help you? EOS 4 0 13 That all sounds great. I think I' ll need to do more exercising. I do like reading so I' ll do that too. Thank you for the suggestions! I appreciate it. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] What would you say might be good exercise or reading goals for you?. EOS 4 0 15 I think just start doing them and continue doing them are good goals for me for now. Thank you! I feel better! EOS 4 1 16 [Others] Whatever works for you. All the best and stay safe.
4 0 0 hi, how are you? My friend, My best friend, has a new friend and hardly has time for me anymore, we have been friend for over ten years. this hurts. EOS 4 1 1 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before. EOS 4 0 2 its so annoying and hurtful. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Yeah i can tell you something you might not want to hear but it ended with us ending our friendship on that level. EOS 4 0 4 i definitely do not want to end our friendship, that would be even more painful. EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years. We still hang out but it isnt like it was before. People move on to others and it hurts. They usually are not trying to hurt us though. EOS 4 0 6 I know, but its hard when you are the one still stuck, Im not ready for change. EOS 4 1 7 [Others] Yea it was hard for me too. Thats the thing about change it just happens. I would do something focusing on yourself. Trying to make yourself feel better. EOS 4 0 8 i could try to focus on myself. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everyone needs to and everyone forgets too heh. EOS 4 0 10 I agree, i need to focus more on myself. EOS 4 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Good, im glad you can realize that! Some people cant.
4 1 0 [Question] Hey there, what' s going on today? EOS 4 0 1 Hello. It is a fine day, how about yourself? EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] It really is! I am just taking in the fresh air in the backyard.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi! What' s on your mind tonight?. EOS 4 0 1 I think a friend I' ve known for 30 years since college has drifted away from me. Even during the pandemic she has made new friends. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, I' m sorry, that' s not fun at all, especially since you two have been friends for so long. Have you tried reaching out to her by phone, email or social media?. EOS 4 0 3 She has cut our conversations short by saying she is tried. She will return text but I feel like I am always initiating. She likes watching tv show and told me with her NEW friend they Facetime and watch TV together. I really hate watching TV so don' t want to offer to participate. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, it' s a positive sign that she hasn' t blocked you completely. I agree, texting her each day could irritate her. That' s okay! You shouldn' t do anything that isn' t fun or enjoyable or comfortable for either of you, in my opinion. EOS 4 0 5 I am jealous that she is more successful in making new friends. I have not made a new friend in over 10 years. EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life. EOS 4 0 7 I don' t have many other friends and they are out of state. The one we are talking about lived an hour away but we would see each other 4 to 6 times a year, EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you' re saying you feel hurt and depressed at not being able to make new friends easily in the pandemic, correct? Ahhhh.,..... yes that; s difficult, oh boy. EOS 4 0 9 Hurt, mad, jealous. I have trouble getting out enough to make friends - even if there wasn' t a pandemic. I work a lot. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] For the time being we' re all stuck at home mostly, so maybe take some comfort in that in a strange way. Heck I rarely see my friends - maybe once a year, so I know how that feels. EOS 4 0 11 Good to know I' m not alone. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] On the bright side of things, at least you have a job. Do you enjoy your job? Maybe start friendships with coworkers, possibly. EOS 4 0 13 Work place is very small and I' m not in the clique there. Vaccine will be available to my age group soon and the weather is getting warmer. So there is that to look forward too. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] How often do you get out for fresh air? Sure it' s not going to solve the lack of friends but it does help to clear your mind to go outside the next few months after work. EOS 4 0 15 Good idea. I really hope being able to take walks will help me clear my thoughts. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, I agree with you, the warmer weather with the vaccine will probably speed up the end of all this. Cabin fever is real. EOS 4 0 17 I may join the book club when the library reopens. EOS 4 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard for people in our situation right now because there' s only so many virtual things to attend but maybe I just thought of a virtual cocktail hour, and you could go on Facebook or even meetup. com or a free dating site to connect with other people in our situation who live near you. The book club is a great idea.

EOS 0 0 21 I have tried glassdoor before, have you had any luck there? EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used it a bit, I mainly used indeed. EOS 0 0 23 and have you showcased your skills using LinkedIn before? I have had that one recommended to me before, they said its a great way to neatly organize accomplishments and personal background. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes especially if you are applying for anything in a professional setting that is very important. EOS 0 0 25 do you have any examples of online skills you completed? EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] coursera has a lot of great courses, it really depends on what you are looking for. EOS 0 0 27 if I was looking to enter the engineering field, any recommendations? EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Is that what you are going to school for? EOS 0 0 29 yes but I may change my mind. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] What year are you in? most engineering programs have a practicum and that is a great opportunity to make contacts and potentially get offered a job. EOS 0 0 31 yes I have been networking as I go. EOS 0 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly you seem like you are pretty on top of this I don' t think you will have any issues finding a job. EOS 0 0 33 yeah I mean the topic was about final exam stress but we got on a tangent. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Yes that is fair enough, how much time do you have until your exam? EOS 0 0 35 15 minutes. EOS 0 1 36 [Affirmation and Reassurance] While that is plenty of time to get some studying done:) EOS 0 0 37 yes I probably should, thank you for your insight! EOS 0 1 38 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Honestly I find that if you are going for the test right away I always like to just breath and relax a bit. EOS 0 0 39 yeah no use in cramming for more info when I could just chill out. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You seem like you know what you are doing, I think you will do just fine.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 The season has me down. No family around. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Are you finding time to do things you enjoy by yourself? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 3 trying to work and write but lack motivation. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are feeling some lethargy in this cold season, and feel as though you have no support from your family. EOS 0 0 5 I don' t talk to anyone. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any plans to spend Christmas with family or friends? That may help to break the cycle of feeling low? EOS 0 0 7 I live in a hotel currently. No family or friends around, especially with the virus. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What do you do for work? Are you able to get out of the hotel frequently? EOS 0 0 9 I am a writer. Witht he virus it is hard to meet anyone. i am only here until next week then I have to go to Virignia. My children r all over the country. EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I agree, it is hard to spend time with people at the moment. We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted. It would be good to have something positive to look forward to. EOS 0 0 11 I try the dating sites, but they seem to far away or impersonal. Hope things are better. Just the current season ahs me down. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I can see that. Keep in touch with your family and try to think of positive, happy times you can all have together in the future. EOS 0 0 13 No verbal communication makes it hard. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Can you call them? EOS 0 0 15 I try but the loneliness is the hard part. EOS 0 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this loneliness is really getting to you and you are struggling to see a way forwards. As you are a writer could you perhaps try to make some online friends in forums? EOS 0 0 17 It is just the lack of communication. EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear you. Perhaps you could call one of your children now? See if they' d like to catch - up? EOS 0 0 19 without any communication it makes it seem like a battle alone. My daughter is busy and 3 hours away. different time zones amke it hard. EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] Maybe schedule in a call with her for the future? I have been making time to speak with my family every Tuesday, it gives us something to look forward to each week.
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why? EOS 4 0 8 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID - 19 lockdowns. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] How long have you been working there? EOS 4 0 10 I am very sad about this country and my work situation. For 5 years. I work in accounting. EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID - 19 really has got us all down. EOS 4 0 12 What a great nation we live in..... a future 3rd world one. Yeah, but I was a good accountant. EOS 4 1 13 [Others] WOW, I' m sure that is a big change for you... EOS 4 0 14 Yeah, I have not told my wife about it just yet. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] I agree, this country has got some issues but we can get through them. Uh, oh, how do you think she will react? EOS 4 0 16 Yeah, I am not sure. I better wait to break the news in 2021. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there. EOS 4 0 18 And I am not the only one who is losing my job. Seems that all of accounting is going to be getting the axe. It makes me sad.... EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year. Do you have a resume? EOS 4 0 20 Plus, I have a 50 dollar a day spending habit on lottery tickets to one day hit it BIG. Yes, I have a resume that I have not updated just yet. I have a college education and a CPA to boot, but I need one lucky break in life. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes that will help to get a better perspective on things... taking some time away from everything in order to catch a breath. EOS 4 0 22 Maybe I can spend some quality time with my kids without them knowing I will be out of a job as of 01/ 15/ 2021. It is almost Christmas, too. EOS 4 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I hear ya, I feel like that quite a bit. Like if isn' t one thing it' s another. I' m sure your wife will understand how the economy has gotten and that she knows that it isn' t your fault. EOS 4 0 24 Maybe, but we have a huge mortgage and two BMW' s. We spend lavishly.... Plus, I spend 50 dollars a day on lotto. EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times, but remember all the good times you have had. Those would not be good times if it were' nt for tough times. EOS 4 0 26 True, but the Office was my home away from home. I need to figure out how to deal with my sadness..... EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times. Do you have any hobbies? EOS 4 0 28 Yeah, that is a good point. Should I change careers? I like to walk and do pushups on a regular basis; does that count?? EOS 4 1 29 [Others] I don' t think a huge change like that is neccessary, maybe just looking into options. Unemployment and government help until something else comes up. That is an excellent way to help relieve some stress from our daily lives. EOS 4 0 30 Unemployment doesn' t last forever; plus, I have pride in my work. Americans are suppose to be strong. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Exercise also releases endorphins that can make you feel happy.
4 0 0 Hi. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hi. How can I help you. EOS 4 0 2 I am not happy. I lost my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, thats bad. When you lost your job?
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. EOS 6 0 1 hello. how are you? I wanted to briefly chat about my jealous feeling. My friend sent me a pic as a greeting showing her hubby and I am jealous. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] I am doing good. How are you? EOS 6 0 3 Next time I see her I want to hide my jealous feeling, but not sure if I can do it well. great. I am good. EOS 6 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so, you envy your friend having a good spouse, is that correct? EOS 6 0 5 yes that is correct. EOS 6 1 6 [Question] Are you a female, if I may ask?
6 0 0 I am having a really hard time with something that I did to my boyfriend. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Do you want to talk about it? EOS 6 0 2 Yes, thank you! I was with him since childhood and we are actually still together. I slipped up one night and hate to admit what I did. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you' re holding onto a lot of guilt about this incident. Are you comfortable talking about that night? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, it is intense guilt. I can' t think of anything else. I hate to tell you but I cheated on him. I am so sorry and can' t look at myself in the mirror. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That can really weigh you down, beating yourself up with guilt. Does he know about the incident? EOS 6 0 6 I feel like I am worthless and I don' t deserve to ever be happy or laugh again. I really do love him and I don' t ever want him to find out what I did. Yes, I cant stop beating myself up. He doesn' t know what I did but he is little suspicious. EOS 6 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You definitely deserve to laugh and be happy. One mistake doesn' t define you! EOS 6 0 8 Thank you! A long time ago his sister told me that he cheated on me and I believed her and so I wanted to get him back. EOS 6 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It says a lot about your character that you feel badly about this, that you can see and recognize you acted in a way you don' t agree with. That' s something to build on. That desire to" get even" is definitely understandable. EOS 6 0 10 I appreciate that and have been thinking about character a lot lately. I do believe he cheated on me first, if that even matters now. EOS 6 1 11 [Question] Do you feel like you got what you needed from the experience, as in, that you' ve" gotten even"? EOS 6 0 12 Yes, I feel very even! I won' t do it again. Can I ever give up the guilt that I feel and move on in our relationship or do I have to tell him what I did? I have known couples who don' t tell each other and they are happy now. EOS 6 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] While it may be true in general that honesty is the best policy, in this case I wouldn' t suggest telling him. It is just going to cause angry feelings. But, the fact you already believed he cheated on you and it motivated you to do the same shows a basic lack of trust in this relationship. That' s something you should really look at. EOS 6 0 14 Thank you for making me feel heard. I have been alone in my thoughts and needed to be understood. Yes, I agree with you and I feel like I kind of let it go now that I told you about it. I am going to be in touch regularly of that' s okay? I feel so much better now. I can take a deep breath again and I want to go take a walk with my dog now. Thank you for all of your time and understanding. EOS 6 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m glad you' re feeling better now that you' ve gotten it out in the open. Of course, you are welcome anytime.

EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Ah that sounds tough, why exactly are you stressed? EOS 0 0 4 I have 3 big exams coming up at the same time, and they' re all really important for my final grade. I know I' m going to badly because I haven' t been learning well during the pandemic. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Okay, I understand, I see how that can also make your anxiety worse. Currently, on a scale of 1 - 10 how well are you understanding your course material? EOS 0 0 6 Probably 4. My roommates are just so loud and inconsiderate, I can' t make any progress studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s completely normal you haven' t made any progress. That would make things so hard and I applaud you for coming so far with that going on! EOS 0 0 8 I guess so. But if I fail or do badly on my exams it' s really not going to be good. I' m on a scholarship and have to keep above a 3. 0 gpa. EOS 0 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Would you say your problems start with your roommates?
3 1 0 [Question] Hi! Hope you are doing well? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, yes am doing well. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Glad to know that you are doing well. How may I assist you today? EOS 3 0 3 I had a drinking challenge which has been affecting my marriage for quit sometime now. EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So as far as I understand that you had issues with your wife due to your drinking. Am I right? EOS 3 0 5 Yes that is true.

I can feel how hard you are trying t save your relationship. I appreciate you for that. EOS 3 0 9 Thank you for the encouragement. Will do everything I can to save the situation. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Family comes first. I would do anything to save my marriage as you are doing. I am proud of you. I am pretty sure you both love each other more than anything. EOS 3 0 11 Yes my wife is everything to me and can not imagine loosing her due to some avoidable reasons. EOS 3 1 12 [Others] That should be the spirit. Now nothing can make you apart. Drinking is very easy for you to quit now. you will definitely get a success.

EOS 5 0 3 I' m not happy with an ex friend who talks behind my back to my current friends. EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] ugh. There' s nothing worse than that. Have you confronted the ex friend? EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking. EOS 5 1 6 [Question] oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it? EOS 5 0 7 they' re still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander. EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s an option but I hope it doesn' t go that far again. Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend? EOS 5 0 9 no. i don' t want anything to do with her. if i find out my friends take her side they will be my ex friend too. EOS 5 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand that. You don' t want two people disrespecting you.. EOS 5 0 11 absolutely not. i have a strong constitution about myself and don' t allow to be disrespected by anyone. EOS 5 1 12 [Question] I hear that! What happened in court when you went? If you don' t mind me asking. EOS 5 0 13 i tried to get an order for her to stay away from me. the first judge passed it but the second judge said it wasn' t strong enough.. EOS 5 1 14 [Question] Sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can. Has she been in contact with you? EOS 5 0 15 no. she hasn' t done anything lately for me to get a court order. if she starts anything again i will get a lawyer and sue her. EOS 5 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Seems like a good idea. Steer clear of her and don' t associate with her! Sounds like you' re doing the right thing. Keep your side of the street clean. EOS 5 0 17 absolutely will avoid her. if she ever convinces my friends should i tell them i don' t want to associate with them anymore? EOS 5 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would if I were in your shoes. You don' t need two of the same person. Know what I mean?
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, I' m pretty much down. trying to keep my head afloat. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] im sorry to hear that. Would you care to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 3 0 3 I lost my job some months back and it hasn' t really been easy for me. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, loss of income can be very stressful. Have you been looking for work since then?
0 0 0 Hello, I' m having a terrible day. My name is Sean and I work for a large distribution company. EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] hi! i' m sorry to hear that. how is your work going so far. EOS 0 0 2 The problem with a job like Amazon or Kehe distribution is the quotas. The pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID? EOS 0 0 4 no COVID 19 has nothing to do with any of this work. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how anxious you are right now. Can you give me some more info on your job. EOS 0 0 6 well when there are 50 million americans out of work right it' s a bit scary. i' m a forklift operator..... I move pallets from one area of the warehouse to another but i. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i totally understand how nerve wrecking this is, but trust me you guys being front - line workers are our real heros. EOS 0 0 8 am based on a quota. I am suppose to be able to move 10 pallets per hour. that' s almost impossible as it is a 1 million square foot warehouse. If i get a pallet on the west side and have to move it to the east side that takes 7 - 10 minutes even if your going dangerously fast. doesn' t feel like it to me. EOS 0 1 9 [Question] did you try discussing your concerns with your Team Lead/ Warehouse Supervisor of your group. EOS 0 0 10 I feel like a replaceable cog in a giant machine that doesn' t give two shits whether I show up for work or not despite having over five years experience with over 12 forklifts..... Yes and they always say the same thing. You need to get your numbers up but it' s a catch 22 you can' t possibly safely get your numbers up and accomplish your quotas. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are doing your best and are working really hard.

EOS 0 0 11 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Can you give me some more details?

I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though. Could you tell me what the issue is in particular?

EOS 0 0 2 I do have an idea about it but I am anxious about choosing wrong and boxing myself into something I wish I hadn' t chosen. EOS 0 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Even if you chose wrong, you will generally have plenty of time to make up your mind and choose something that you really like:), plus, you can reach out to academic advisors, for example. EOS 0 0 4 I suppose you' re right, I think I don' t have confidence in myself that what ever I do choose, I will be good at it. Good enough to make a life out of it. fear of failing myself because i lose interest in things over time. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently. EOS 0 0 6 but what if that thing is your career choice? EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is a totally normal aspect of human nature. It' s normal to get bored of things even if we really liked them at some point. Of course, some topics like those are more serious, but as I said, even if you chosed wrong, you can always change your major. EOS 0 0 8 I guess thats right. All I care about is helping others so as long as the choice i make supports that then it will be fine. thank you for your help. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] No problem, and it' s great that you like helping others. I am a firm believer that ultimately making others happy is what makes us happy.

Christmas is right around the corner. I dont know how I am going to get the kids presents. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anyone you are able to ask for support right now, like your parents?

EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I see. And your kids are depending on you to be able to take care of them. I am so sorry; I know that must be extremely stressful. Are you married right now? If so, does your spouse have a job?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:) EOS 2 0 7 It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am in the UK. It' s sort of a grey area... police won' t really do anything but you can' t buy it over the counter. EOS 2 0 9 One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I' m very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially. EOS 2 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot. The US seems to be really strict on it tho.
3 0 0 hello. how are you today? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today?. EOS 3 0 2 a bit sad. more depressed. its just i keep getting benched at work. i' m not really sure what do to.* to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset. EOS 3 0 4 i' m not really sure what i' m doing wrong. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though. EOS 3 0 6 what can i do though? EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there' s anything going on? EOS 3 0 8 hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Of course! That sounds frustrating to not know why it' s happening and not have the opportunity to ask. EOS 3 0 10 yes... hrm. that may work. how can i stop being depressed all the time though.. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' ve also had bosses that are infrequently in the office and make getting good information hard. EOS 3 0 12 how did you fix the issue? i work at home and its like just trying to reach out - they are always busy. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren' t always a reflection of us or how we' re performing. EOS 3 0 14 this whole covid thing has me scrambling to talk to a live person. EOS 3 1 15 [Others] I can imagine! EOS 3 0 16 ok, so just keep pushing and getting good work done? EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I was in a physical office when I had this problem, but the boss rotated between offices. It was hard to wait, but I just kept my head down until the next time she was available. That' s what I did.
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, what brings you to bring the seeker? EOS 6 0 1 I feel upset with myself over my situation. Did you read it? EOS 6 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I did not see it. What is your situation? I am here to listen. EOS 6 0 3 I feel ashamed of my depression symptoms. I feel other people are ashamed of me. EOS 6 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how? EOS 6 0 5 I just can' t live reguarly life like" healthy" people do and they notice my symptoms. They don' t understand how your mind can be your enemy. EOS 6 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are saying that you can' t live regularly and people don' t understand that your mind isn' t working in your favor. Is that right? Can you tell me what you mean by your mind being your enemy? EOS 6 0 7 Like I have no interest or motivation to do ANYTHING some days. Hard to even take care of my hygiene. My mind doesn' t care to do it even when it' s embarrasing for people to notice. EOS 6 1 8 [Greeting] That sounds very hard. I can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn' t want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself. What do you do to cope? EOS 6 0 9 stay away from mean people, stop tryiig to explain my symptoms to others who won' t get it. EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That makes sense why you would want to avoid doing these things, which is a good thing, but is there anything that you try to do that isn' t avoidance? Something that approaches something? EOS 6 0 11 I go to all my therapy appoints and try to participate. Thanks for your help. Have a good day. EOS 6 1 12 [Question] How do you feel about therapy? EOS 6 0 13 I have to go now. Bye. EOS 6 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is unfortunate, but I understand. We haven' t finished, the task, however, but I hope you feel better. EOS 6 0 15 I can stay a bit longer. I' m just tired. EOS 6 1 16 [Others] I think we just need 3 more responses each, let' s say. EOS 6 0 17 Thanks. EOS 6 1 18 [Question] Okay, so can you tell me how frequently you sleep?
2 0 0 Good afternoon/ evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you tonight? EOS 2 0 2 Doing great. How about yourself? EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I' m doing well how can I help you tonight? EOS 2 0 4 So, the issue I' m having is work - related. My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He' s also in the middle of testing for CP. My job requires that I be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask... but sometimes the people I am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6 - foot boundary. A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills. My son just turned 2. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you' d wish they wear a mask? EOS 2 0 6 I have. A few people respected my wishes. But one in particular stands out. A gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. He got angry at my request. In my shoes, what would you do? Because I feel like Im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol. EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don' t honor your requests? EOS 2 0 8 It makes me feel trapped. Frustrated. I would never intentionally try to put someone else in harms way and I feel like I don t.* don' t get the same courtesy. I feel frustrated because I' m REQUIRED to deal with people. I work in construction. I feel trapped because, what are my options? Continue to work..... my son gets sick and dies. His pediatrician has already warned me how deadly this could be for me. And if I quit? No money? I have a 5 year old I have to take care of too.. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before I share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue? EOS 2 0 10 I' ve spoken to my boss. He was sympathetic about it all.... At this point I' m not sure what to do. EOS 2 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Alright. Have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less? Or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 3 0 1 Hello. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, i feel like i am in depsression. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed?? EOS 3 0 5 My partner broke up with me impromptu. EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now. EOS 3 0 7 Exactly, that is my current situation. I feel like my entire life has been rearranged. How did you deal with them and specifically what was your coping mechanism? EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days. I slowly realised that i had put myself in slow motion and then slowly started to do things i used to do to maybe come out of it. EOS 3 0 9 True, what ways would you suggest i use to approach my situation and get out of this state? It is very pathetic really when you think of it, halting all your life activities and plans just because a relationship ended. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well i had a close friend that i was able to vent to and help me see what was important. Do you have anyone close in your life you could talk to for guidance? EOS 3 0 11 Close friends can really be helpful in such situations. Yes, i do have a close friend even though i am very poor when it comes to opening up. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see what you mean about pathetic lol. But rather than see yourself as pathetic in a negative, use that defiance to push yourself back out into the world. Start slowly with opening up, maybe even tell your friend you intent and ask them to be patient as you learn to better express your inner feelings.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hi, how are you feeling today? EOS 3 0 2 I am not feeling the best. I have been having some depression, because of not being able to see friends and family during this pandemic. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Oh, boy, do I know that feeling! How are you dealing with it?( if I may ask) EOS 3 0 4 I try to message them as much as possible and call them on the phone but it is just not the same as actually getting to give the a hug and see them in person. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] I know that. I use Zoom, just to see them... do you have a computer? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. That works for some of my family but I have family in the nursing home that does not have access to computers. I haven' t seen them in several months. It just breaks my heart. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh. I can feel it. I have someone who' s sick as well. Do you have any one friend with whom you can share your feelings, your depression. I understand you' re having issues with depression, right? It sometimes helps me to feel that we' re all in this together. And, at the other end of this, we will be able to give the biggest hugs ever! EOS 3 0 8 Yes. I have some very dear friends that have helped me a lot. I guess the depression is just worse because it is the holidays and this is the first year that I haven' t got to spend it with my extended family members. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Oh.... That' s so tough... it being the first year!!!! Sometimes, I cry( I cry with my cat), and just to say the feelings out loud makes me feel a bit better. EOS 3 0 10 Yeah. I have a little dog that has been my cuddle buddy. I have had him for 13 years so he has seen me ugly cry many times. What are some things you do to deal with depression? EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I try to read, watch programs or podcasts that take away my negativity. Anything that will give me a lift, so that my own depression won' t get so bad that I can' t remember what it felt like to be a bit happy. EOS 3 0 12 That sounds like some good advice. I think I will try to find a good podcast or a good comedy series that I like and spend time doing that. It' s hard to be sad when you are watching something funny or listening to something funny. Thank you for the good advice and the listening ear. EOS 3 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I wish that I could listen to more.... this thing is so slow. Remember, we' re all in this together, and we will come out the other end. Isn' t it OK to be happy a bit, even though this takes such a toll on so many people? EOS 3 0 14 That is so true. I guess we tend to feel guilty if we feel happy since there is so much sadness in the world right now. But you are so right about the fact that we will come out on the other side. It helps to remember that bad things don' t last forever. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, and are you somewhere where you can walk or exercise a bit? I always feel better if I can move around... dance... something active. What I find helps me the most is to remember that we need to stay safe and be OK, so that we will be here to celebrate when this is over. EOS 3 0 16 Yes. I live in the country so I can go for nice walks when the weather is nice. Staying safe is definitely important right now. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh... it' s fortunate that you live in the country. Can you take some deep breathes and watch the trees, the animals, and nature.... they are all here for us???
1 0 0 Hello I am having pro\ blems with a friend. EOS 1 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so so sorry to hear that. What has been going on? EOS 1 0 2 Sometimes she is very friendly, but sometimes she is super rude. In a way that is so rude that it has never happened before by someone who I consider a friend. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh wow, it sounds like shes not a very good frined. EOS 1 0 4 As nice as she is, every once in a while show will be equally nasty. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Have you tried talking to her about it? EOS 1 0 6 Super snarky comments. Yes I have tried. But it still continues. EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried seperating from her? EOS 1 0 8 I can' t she is a colleague. So unless I want to get a new job. but she is super helpful and nice 99 percent of the time. And when I have spoken with her, the last time I was very clear with her that it was inappropriate, and it hasn' t been happening as often, but the whole situation is still very hurtful. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s so hurtful. Do others feel the same as you? EOS 1 0 10 Yes, I have heard these complaints from one other person. Do you have any ideas or other suggestions for me. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you can try talking to yoru manager next time it happens? It is hard but you can only really control yourself, so you need to try to emotionally distance yourself from when she is terrible. You seem like a good persn. EOS 1 0 12 That is a good idea to talk to a manager. but there is no avoiding working with her because of the nature of my job. but that is an option that I didn' t considerr before so thatnk you for your insight. Thank you that is very nice. Let me know if you have any other ideas as well. EOS 1 1 13 [Self-disclosure] Of course!! managers are erally helpful. I had a similar sitation with a coworker two years ago and the head of my group really helped me clear it up. EOS 1 0 14 Did you try other things as well. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I tried really hard not to let her get to me. Which was really hard but doable. EOS 1 0 16 Oh that is good, sometimes when a person sees that they are not getting under your skin they give up on pushing your buttons, was that what happened in your case. EOS 1 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Exactly!!!!
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there! What would you like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 1 I am trying to be fine and you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] It may be helpful to know.. my name is Ann. I am 43 years old... and I know for myself, I enjoy talking to people when I have concerns. What is going on? EOS 0 0 3 Thank you for your concern, I am just worried. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What has you worried? I know right now... its a hard time for so many people. I have struggled with my own anxiety the past few weeks. EOS 0 0 5 Sorry about that. This is about my relationship. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah.... relationship worries can be so draining and emotionally exhausting. I can understand that. In your relationship, what has happened to create your worries? EOS 0 0 7 I trusted my spouse but eventually disappointed. She got a jot in another town and she utilize the opportunity to be sleeping around. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine how a break in trust has made you feel. I know a break in trust is always very difficult to process. EOS 0 0 9 I am planing to get married next year but things has changed now. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Oh I am sorry to hear that. Have you had a conversation with her about her actions and how they have made you feel? EOS 0 0 11 She knew pretty well how I felt. I don' t want to have anything to do with her again. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel that her actions and result can be remedied? Or is this such a fundamental break that you cannot reconcile? EOS 0 0 13 I just want to move on with my life. EOS 0 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Understandable. I would feel similar, in truth. EOS 0 0 15 I don' t that I can love her again. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Only you know whether or not if you can look to forgiving and moving forward or if this is such a fundamental break that it is not something you can mend. And if you know that this is not something you wish to move forward with her that doesn’t make you a bad person. It means you are taking care of yourself first. EOS 0 0 17 Yes, I want someone that I could trust. EOS 0 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Absolutely. Trust is to me a cornerstone of healthy relationships. So I can fully appreciate those feelings and needs. I think fundamentally as humans we want to partner with individuals who we find that we can feel safe with and trust.
6 0 0 hi my friend. EOS 6 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] Hello! How are you doing? EOS 6 0 2 feeling very shame. EOS 6 1 3 [Question] Oh my god! What happened? EOS 6 0 4 i have cheated on my girlfriend. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel sorry for you.. What was the reason behind that? I understand how you are feeling right now. EOS 6 0 6 me and my girlfriend mom had an physical relationship but till now my girlfriend belives im good guy. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Calm down friend. EOS 6 0 8 what should i do now. EOS 6 1 9 [Question] Can i know the reason why you got attracted to her mom when she herself is there? Chill out friend, feel good atleast now you have realised your mistake. Whatever happened has happened, forget everything.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that? EOS 0 0 21 being on the board gives me perks. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Not so great - found out i' m losing my job in january. EOS 2 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] On no I am sorry to hear that! I know that must be tough.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way?

2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:) EOS 2 0 7 It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am in the UK. It' s sort of a grey area... police won' t really do anything but you can' t buy it over the counter. EOS 2 0 9 One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I' m very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially. EOS 2 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot. The US seems to be really strict on it tho. EOS 2 0 11 It varies, state by state, depending on which party is governing. Which you of course have a version of in the UK. Mayoral elections were today yeah? EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] They were but I didn' t pay much attention:) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that' s all. EOS 2 0 13 Oh, well, I' m sorry to hear that. I think participation in local governance is actually the most achievable path for change, but perhaps how it' s structured where you are, it wouldn' t really matter much if you participated. I guess mayorals are only technically local, not like parliamentary elections. EOS 2 1 14 [Others] If I were in London or a major city I' d vote for Mayor. I am in a rural area and we don' t have one: D. I vote for local councillors tho. EOS 2 0 15 Oh, I take it to mean that you are anti - Khan? If you feel like you' d need to vote for mayor in London.

4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello. I need some help. I have been depressed. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you doing today? Do have anything on your mind? Oh i see, well we can talk about that if you like. Has anything happened recently to make you feel this way? EOS 4 0 3 I am not doing very well. Very depressed with having to stay home because of the COVID - 19/ I will appreciate anything you can do to help me. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like social isolation is really weighing on you... EOS 4 0 5 Yes, it sure is. I feel so alone. I feel it will help to talk to an outsider. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Human being are social creatures by nature so please understand that the feelings that you are having are absolutely normal. So dont judge yourself or feel as if something is wrong with YOU. EOS 4 0 7 Sometimes it helps to a stranger - most of my friends feel as I do. I am sure you are right - I thank you for your support.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You mentioned your friends feel the same way you do... Have you guys thought about making trying to do a zoom party? EOS 4 0 9 No, we haven' t talked about that, but that is a great idea. I will talk to them to see how they feel about doing this. Thank you. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have a group of sister friends and we threw a zoom party. we scheduled it out and we decorated our own spaces and we made a spotify playlist that everyone contributed a song to and basically just had a video party. Do you think your frinds may like to try that with you? EOS 4 0 11 I feel somewhat better just thin. I feel a little better now. I look forward to talking with my friends about doing Zoom. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Be creative! Get silly! most important have fun! this is a hard year but its still a chance to make happy memories. Is there anything else on your mind? EOS 4 0 13 I will. Having fun is what I need in my life. I know it' s been a tough year for everyone. Thank you very much. Have a great day. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] Im so glad that I could help you out! You have a great day too!
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all. EOS 0 0 45 Also being far away from him sucks. EOS 0 1 46 [Question] Are you guys FaceTiming or communicating at all other than by texts? EOS 0 0 47 You are being very helpful by the way thank you. We aren' t FaceTiming. I just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it.. EOS 0 1 48 [Greeting] I' m trying my best, thank you for the input! Upset about leaving the apartment? Or was there something else that happened that weekend? EOS 0 0 49 Just leaving him. EOS 0 1 50 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you guys thought about scheduling date nights through FaceTime? EOS 0 0 51 I think he would but he hasn' t been feeling really good about his appearance lately. I asked and that' s what he told me. EOS 0 1 52 [Self-disclosure] I understand that completely, I can relate a lot. EOS 0 0 53 Same. EOS 0 1 54 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If it makes any difference, my partner and I have been doing date nights where we would dress up, put make up on and do our hair and everything as if we were going to the restaurant, and even if it is through Facetime or whenever we see each other in real life, it helps not only with our own self - esteem but also our relationship. EOS 0 0 55 That is very cute. EOS 0 1 56 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could open the discussion with your boyfriend, tell him that you have a date planned over Facetime and you want him to order his favorite dinner, take a shower, do his hair and dress up real nice. EOS 0 0 57 I don' t know if he would be open to that but I could try. He isn' t really the romantic type. EOS 0 1 58 [Question] You have been friends for a long time before getting together, you guys are comfortable with each other, right? EOS 0 0 59 Yes. EOS 0 1 60 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay well you do know him more than I do haha, so what would be his ideal date night?
5 1 0 [Question] Hi there. How are you today? EOS 5 0 1 I' m good. how r u? EOS 5 1 2 [Question] I' m doing good today. What brings you on here? EOS 5 0 3 I' m not happy with an ex friend who talks behind my back to my current friends. EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] ugh. There' s nothing worse than that. Have you confronted the ex friend? EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking. EOS 5 1 6 [Question] oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it? EOS 5 0 7 they' re still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander. EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s an option but I hope it doesn' t go that far again. Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend? EOS 5 0 9 no. i don' t want anything to do with her. if i find out my friends take her side they will be my ex friend too. EOS 5 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand that. You don' t want two people disrespecting you.. EOS 5 0 11 absolutely not. i have a strong constitution about myself and don' t allow to be disrespected by anyone. EOS 5 1 12 [Question] I hear that! What happened in court when you went? If you don' t mind me asking.

I don' t know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down( obviously) and there doesn' t appear to be any real reason behind it. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue? EOS 3 0 4 I felt this way for a while actually isn' t a recent change it' s been building slowly over time. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same? EOS 3 0 6 I think I know what you mean. It' s getting worse. I feel very down. EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse. EOS 3 0 8 Yeah. I worry that I' ll just keep feeling even more down and depressed.

Many people struggle with depression and it' s good that you have reached out for help for this. EOS 3 0 10 Any suggestions on what to do about it?

EOS 4 0 8 I can' t sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it' s typically late afternoon.

EOS 4 0 10 thank you. i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] it sounds to me that your sleep issue is really weighing on your mind. you may be setting yourself up for sleep issues by thinking about this so much. is that possible? EOS 4 0 12 yes it may be. i' m not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking.

EOS 4 0 18 maybe overwatch. i haven' t been playing them much.

EOS 4 0 20 i am. but i have a hard time focusing as of late. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can make a goal of reading a few pages and then see if you can build on that. then, if you want, you can make a goal of reading a chapter. EOS 4 0 22 that' s a great idea. that may help a lot with focus. EOS 4 1 23 [Self-disclosure] personally i love reading; especially non fiction. what type of books do you enjoy? EOS 4 0 24 dystopian fantasy style books. and also historical nonfiction. EOS 4 1 25 [Self-disclosure] i enjoy historical non fiction very much. do you have any favorite authors?

4 0 0 I am so embarassed and saddened. I can not believe he cheated on me. I thought we were going to work out. I was really attracted into him and I cared for him a lot. I wanted to date him longer. Thank Goodness I did not sleep with him. What a disaster. Why are men like this? Why do they break women' s hearts? I wish there were more decent men out there that did not play around. Men can be such pigs! EOS 4 1 1 [Question] what happened? EOS 4 0 2 I met a handsome intelligent man. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how are you feeling lately?

Just chatting with you, you seem very a smart, strong girl. Do not be upset about things you can' t control. EOS 3 0 8 i think i should divert my concentration on something else. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] For sure, what else we need to talk about?

EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you. EOS 4 0 3 I think that my boyfriend is cheating on me again!!! EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Are you saying that he has cheated on you before? That does not sound very promising. EOS 4 0 5 He has but it was a long time ago and was before we had a talk about exclusivity in our relationship but it still hurt. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Have you considered getting some sort of couples counselling? Or do you just think that he is never going to change? EOS 4 0 7 We tried counselling once.. It was online and we got paid to do it.. I don' t think he took it seriously at the time. He always said he felt like he was being attacked. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. So you feel that he is not really taking your problems as a couple seriously? EOS 4 0 9 Yes. I feel he thinks of me as some sort of trophy and he does not have to work now that he won me over in the first place. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have been in toxic relationships before and to be honest it does sound a little as though this is one of those situations.
3 0 0 Hi. I am Mike. Live in central Kansas and have been very depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that, is there a particular reason or instance for you feeling this way? EOS 3 0 2 I lost my job due to Covid and they have shut down for good. no jobs around here and no vehicle so i feel hopeless and hate my living situation. just before covid hit i was saving to move... but then job closed. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes that is a very tough situation, Covid has real placed a large amount of stress through out the world. There may be a ray of hope however with a possible vaccine in the near future, maybe this will be back to normal soon and new jobs will become available. EOS 3 0 4 I hope so and that is what i know mentally. but emotionally it is hard. i just hate having no job, being at home, no money, no vehicle, and a very bad idea to date since there is a high contagious pandemic. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand and you are right it is a a lot of mental stress. Have you reached out to claim unemployment or go to a food pantry? During this pandemic you should not feel shameful to take advantage of these services, there are alot of people who have to ask for help for the first time in their lives. EOS 3 0 6 I did not make enough to get unemployment they said. I have not tried a food pantry but that is a great idea. what makes this difficult is I am in a very small town. like we dont wal marts or McDonalds or anything like that. Whole town closes at 9. the closest actual city is 45 miles away. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well please try the food pantry and see what they have to offer. Is there anyone whom you could ask for a ride in the future when they go to the bigger city? EOS 3 0 8 I will try food pantry. my sister goes to the city once a month, we shop for the month and i stay with my siter. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well its seem that you now have a plan try it out see how it works, hopefully this will get back to normal sooner than later and life may go back to somewhat normal and your stress level and mental exhaustion will also subside. Is there anything else you would like to talk about? EOS 3 0 10 Well I have been wanting a relationship. and i normally dont feel that way at all. and past week i think how much i kind of should have a family as I am 37 but not sure if i truly want that or i just miss human contact as i have only been around family and not gone out at all except to walk and go to store in town, and am confused if it is actully me wanting somone in my life or just a physical thing. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think your exactly right, human contact is now a premium and I' m sure you miss that contact that we were once so use to. Missing the contact makes you realize how much you enjoy the company of others. Take it slow and once the vaccine is out ease your way back into the dating scene and see if a relationship is what you really wanted after all. EOS 3 0 12 yeah i mean emotionally i want to go maybe try a date or two or even just an adult night out but know logically it is a VERY risky idea. And that I need to not do anything like that till next year at the minimum. I do appreciate the advice and ideas. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] Remember that age is only a number and love will no no number, we are hear to listen and support you so if you ever need to talk just know we are a mouse click away. EOS 3 0 14 And appreciate that especially during the current situation. EOS 3 1 15 [Greeting] Your welcome stay strong. EOS 3 0 16 You as well. EOS 3 1 17 [Greeting] Thank you. EOS 3 0 18 Oh I did want to ask. do you have any experience in either Alaska or Arizona? I know vastly differnt places but when I move I had been considering those. among others. Alska seems so risky but potentially amazing but it is rather far away from" main america" EOS 3 1 19 [Others] I do not have any personal experience and yes they do sound amazing.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today. EOS 3 0 2 I feel bad putting this on your shoulders, maybe you can help. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] i have big shoulders! whats on your mind?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all. EOS 0 0 45 Also being far away from him sucks. EOS 0 1 46 [Question] Are you guys FaceTiming or communicating at all other than by texts?
4 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling really sad and lonely right now. My boyfriend and I broke up and it was me who wanted it but now I regret breaking up and he doesn' t want me back. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, I can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it' s too late.
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Somewhat stressed but otherwise ok. How about you? EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I am great, it snowed and looks like Christmas here. Why are you so stressed? EOS 0 0 4 I' m developing romantic feelings for a friend but she doesn' t share those feelings with me in return. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. I have been there myself.. Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend? EOS 0 0 6 Yes, I had received that advice from someone and tried it but it didn' t help. We have been friends for a long time and I think it would be tough to smother these romantic feelings. EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Have you thought about talking with this friend about these feelings? EOS 0 0 8 I have but I' m sure she wouldn' t react very well and it could damage our relationship.. I' m also pretty sure she' s already aware. She' s pretty sharp. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well maybe you should address these feelings with her in a very relaxed public atmosphere. Just let her know that you really like her and you have realized that she has many of the qualities that you look for in a person to get serious with. However, you treasure your friendship more than anything and you do not want anything to come in between your friendship.... this way you have addressed your feelings, she knows how you feel and then should she decide to every take the friendship to the next step, she wouldn' t feel awkward. EOS 0 0 10 That sounds like a good plan. I do like having things out in the open instead of holding them in. My other thought was to maybe try to seek out a romantic partner that isn' t her so then maybe the feelings would go to another focus and it wouldn' t damage our relatinship. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a great idea. Have you been dating other people much?
2 0 0 Hello. Maybe you can help me calm down. I just found out that I' m losing my job in January.( 1) EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hello! I hope I can. I am so sorry to hear that. That' s so rough. There are so many people going through this right now. EOS 2 0 2 Yes and that worries me even more. More people competing for the same jobs.( 2) EOS 2 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a fare worry but you can' t be discourged. YOu need to think positively. You can use this as a time to reconnect with family and to get your resume together. EOS 2 0 4 I will have to do a new resume definitely. It' s been awhile.( 3) EOS 2 1 5 [Question] That' s a good activity!! Do you have anyone who can help you with it? EOS 2 0 6 I' ll have to think on that, I have a friend that might be able to help but it' s been awhile for both of us( 4) EOS 2 1 7 [Question] Do you have any hobbies you can work on while you' re home?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 I am well, thanks for asking. I am doing some studying and taking a break now. Just to talk about some of the feelings, thoughts, and stresses. The big thing on my mind now is the pandemic. And it' s the start of the second wave in my city.. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand what you are going though, indeed it is tough times. EOS 3 0 4 yeah it sure has been since March this year for my city. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So tell me, what are you going through your mind regarding the pandemic and the second wave? EOS 3 0 6 There' s kind of a lag as I am on the East Coast. So the cases didn' t really show up for the second wave until this month, only sporadically last month. But we were doing now until about two to three weeks ago. well fear, anxiety. worries, and also anger that people are being foolish and complacent, especially the youth groups that go to gyms and restaurants a lot, or to gatherings. even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, I don' t know and it just boggles on my mind.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I understand, I' m from the east coast and I' m deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown. EOS 3 0 8 I get that there' s a fatigue but I was there and I had that fatigue and I got over that a few months ago late summer when I tried to reason myself that it was safe to go out when there weren' t any cases then, as the first w ave was gone from my city. I see. Yeah I feel you definitely. like people are becoming impatient but this is not the right time to be. If I can overcome that initial impatience, others should also. If they have no right reason to be out except for work and personal business, then I don' t think they should be doing that too much.. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I think those who are aware of the situation should follow the rules and be aware. We really can' t change the situation because it human nature.
4 1 0 [Question] hi how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Not good, i am very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i' m sorry. whats making you sad?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there! What would you like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 1 I am trying to be fine and you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] It may be helpful to know.. my name is Ann. I am 43 years old... and I know for myself, I enjoy talking to people when I have concerns. What is going on? EOS 0 0 3 Thank you for your concern, I am just worried. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What has you worried? I know right now... its a hard time for so many people. I have struggled with my own anxiety the past few weeks. EOS 0 0 5 Sorry about that. This is about my relationship. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah.... relationship worries can be so draining and emotionally exhausting. I can understand that. In your relationship, what has happened to create your worries? EOS 0 0 7 I trusted my spouse but eventually disappointed. She got a jot in another town and she utilize the opportunity to be sleeping around. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine how a break in trust has made you feel. I know a break in trust is always very difficult to process. EOS 0 0 9 I am planing to get married next year but things has changed now. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Oh I am sorry to hear that. Have you had a conversation with her about her actions and how they have made you feel? EOS 0 0 11 She knew pretty well how I felt. I don' t want to have anything to do with her again. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel that her actions and result can be remedied? Or is this such a fundamental break that you cannot reconcile? EOS 0 0 13 I just want to move on with my life. EOS 0 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Understandable. I would feel similar, in truth. EOS 0 0 15 I don' t that I can love her again. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Only you know whether or not if you can look to forgiving and moving forward or if this is such a fundamental break that it is not something you can mend. And if you know that this is not something you wish to move forward with her that doesn’t make you a bad person. It means you are taking care of yourself first. EOS 0 0 17 Yes, I want someone that I could trust. EOS 0 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Absolutely. Trust is to me a cornerstone of healthy relationships. So I can fully appreciate those feelings and needs. I think fundamentally as humans we want to partner with individuals who we find that we can feel safe with and trust. EOS 0 0 19 Yes, you understood my fear. EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I do think, and I am not sure how old you are, but infidelity is unfortunately not super rare. I have experienced it myself. I used some resources on even places like Reddit( Surviving Infidelity) to help me process what I had experienced and to also learn from others.
3 0 0 hello. anyone there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with today? EOS 3 0 2 am not fine. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What is it that is making you feel this way? EOS 3 0 4 i was cheated on severally, and it resulted me to end the relationship. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you had to deal with a partner recently cheating and a breakup, is this right? EOS 3 0 6 yes thats it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this has been stressful for you and you are trying to figure out how to move on from this. EOS 3 0 8 exactly, i can tend to focus because i have given so much time and affection, i never thought i would be called the fool after everything i did. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is incredibly difficult to get something like this off your mind and it seems like you are trying your best to move forward with your life. EOS 3 0 10 i want to move on but i dont know how, i tried to but i just cant. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I have been through this, I learned how to keep myself busy and do things that I enjoy to occupy my mind and let time heal those wounds. EOS 3 0 12 i think you right, maybe i should renew my netflix sub, since i find great interest in movies so as to get some positive vibes and think less of this whole situation. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Science shows that during a breakup sometimes you romanticize the relationship and view it as better than it actually was and missing something that wasn' t as good as you thought. EOS 3 0 14 yh thats true. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] My suggestion is to focus on new hobbies, spend time with friends and family when possible, if you have work you can do in the mean time, if you like to exercise or go outside, all of this is a helpful tool.
4 0 0 I' m feeling really sad, I thought it was going somewhere. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What do you mean you thought it was going somewhere? Are you okay? EOS 4 0 2 yes I' m okay, I' m so sad. five years, I gave my heart to this girl. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Did you guys break up recently? EOS 4 0 4 yes she broke my heart last night, what did I do wrong? EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong. You shouldn' t blame yourself. EOS 4 0 6 but I gave her my all. I feel so betrayed. I' m feeling so sad I want to jump over a bridge. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there, a few years before I was married, my boyfriend broke up with me. We had some space, and then were able to become friends again. And you know what? We ended up getting back together and getting married. EOS 4 0 8 you think it' s my fault? 5 years man, 5 years and just like that she broke my heart. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t give up, you never know what the future holds. I don' t know your particular situation, but it takes two to make relationships work. I don' t think you should blame yourself.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, what brings you to seek support, today? EOS 4 0 1 I am having ongoing depression. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin? EOS 4 0 3 I have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It first began a couple of weeks ago. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I am sad and anxious about the coronavirus. I miss seeing my friends and family. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you must really care about your friends and family, and this awful pandemic is prevent your from seeing them. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, definitely. I hope the pandemic will end. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all? EOS 4 0 9 I haven' t thought about dying at all. I take medication each day for my depression, but there are times when I still feel sad. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay, thanks for sharing that personal information. I only ask because thoughts of suicide are normal and anxiety and depression increase the chances of suicide. EOS 4 0 11 You' re welcome. I understand, but I am not suicidal. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] What would you like to talk about, then? We could talk about the problem more, or if you feel like it is defined, we could talk about solutions, or not talk about solutions at all. What would make you feel better? EOS 4 0 13 I would like to talk about solutions since I feel like the problem is defined. EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I know what it is like to be depressed. I also take medication for this. For solutions, studies show that working out and exercising can help depression. Have you considered this?
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing? EOS 6 0 1 I' m doing okay.. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you want to talk about? EOS 6 0 3 I' m having problems with getting up everyday and doing my daily routine. I feel bad because these are things that other people do normally. EOS 6 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah, I' ve definitely felt that way... especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day? EOS 6 0 5 Exactly. Jogging, eating breakfast, getting dressed. EOS 6 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yep, for me it' s kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just" take a break" from grinding. MTurk has kind of helped me get back in a working mindset and given me more energy... have you been doing a lot of MTurk lately? EOS 6 0 7 Yeah, 2020 has been a crazy year. I' ve been doing Mturk here and there. I plan on doing it more. It helps me stay productive. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah it helps, just forcing yourself to have goals, for sure. I' ve been determined to hit a number on MTurk and exercise every time I' m feeling tired, instead of taking a nap because my boss can' t see me, lol. I would definitely say just start setting goals and try to look forward to 2021 being better. EOS 6 0 9 Okay, I hear you. Thanks. Yeah, I guess I have to really force myself. EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Force yourself at first, then the" body in motion, stays in motion" law will take over.:) All I know, is that nothing is worse than ending a day without a sense of accomplishment and then stringing those kinds of days together. EOS 6 0 11 Okay okay. cool. That' s a helpful concept. I' m going to force myself to get up and then hopefully my body will get used to it. Yes, that' s true. I hate ending the day knowing I' ve bummed it out. EOS 6 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] One of the things I' ve noticed about 2020 and I think this contributes is that this year has taken away almost all incentives... you know before it would be like," I' m looking forward to this concert, or this movie coming out next weekend." So, when you aren' t planning things and don' t have these milestones throughout the year of events breaking up the monotony, it stinks.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello.:) How are you? EOS 0 0 1 I am okay. A little anxious I am feeling helpless. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am sorry to hear that. What are you feeling helpless about? EOS 0 0 3 I am worried about upcoming bills. I lost my job. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I see. I would be worried about that as well. How long have you been out of work? EOS 0 0 5 About 2 weeks. Christmas is right around the corner. I dont know how I am going to get the kids presents. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anyone you are able to ask for support right now, like your parents? I am sure they would understand, since so many people have been losing jobs lately. EOS 0 0 7 I don' t have a lot if family.. I have my sister who lives far away. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I see. And your kids are depending on you to be able to take care of them. I am so sorry; I know that must be extremely stressful. Are you married right now? If so, does your spouse have a job? EOS 0 0 9 Yes, my kids are older, yes I am married and he is working. He isnt easy to talk to.. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] I see. Do you mean that you are not on good terms with him? EOS 0 0 11 Its off and on. Some days are better than others.. I think its just the weather. Its cold. Gloomy that doesn' t help either. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I can understand that. It' s been cold and gloomy over here and my whole family has been in a bad mood. It seems like a little thing, but I find that taking Vitamin D supplements when the weather is bad helps me not to get depressed. EOS 0 0 13 I am just ready for 2021. It has been a scary year all around. Hmm, Maybe I should try that.. EOS 0 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Yep. Me too. I' m ready for all of this mess to be over. EOS 0 0 15 Vitamins cant hurt anyone. I just hope 2021 is better for everyone. EOS 0 1 16 [Question] How important is it for you to be able to work right now? Does your husband make enough money to pay the bills and make sure you have somewhere to stay?
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? I' d love to chat with you! What' s been on your mind? EOS 3 0 1 oh hello. I' m having problems with friends - or more precisely the lack of them. I don' t have any. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see. You feel as though you don' t have any friend' s currently? I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It' s so hard to see people and keep relationships right now. EOS 3 0 3 Well it' s more that I think I' ve never had friends. Not anyone I can confide in or laugh with. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a really hard thing to be going through. I' m sorry to hear that. Do you have any really close family members that you are able to confide in? EOS 3 0 5 I don' t think I' d want to let them know how unhappy I am to be honest. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Oh I see. Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn' t have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out! IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it' s 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do. I actually found a couple close friends through apps like that. Have you heard about those or looked into them? EOS 3 0 7 I' ve never heard of friendship apps to be honest. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah! They are a really good way to connect with people that you share a lot of similar interests with.. But it sounds to me that you are pretty overall sad right now. You don' t want family to know about how sad you are. Do you think it' s more than just feeling like you don' t have any friends?

I have very close friend who has ADHD and trying to cope with it. EOS 0 0 9 Thankyou for allowing me some of your time. I would be so much better if my heart wasnt poorly.

EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest you keep close touch with the support group and the therapist.. I see you are already in the right path.. EOS 0 0 15 I just wish to live outside my own sideways mind for 5 minutes. I need help with not becoming frustrated and angry with myself. Cant really see a way forward, am i destined to be absent minded for life? i know there must be a way somewhere to live normally. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] As you are already engaged with the professionals to help you.. I bet you will get the necessary help. Keep pursing these engagements...
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, I' m pretty much down. trying to keep my head afloat. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] im sorry to hear that. Would you care to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 3 0 3 I lost my job some months back and it hasn' t really been easy for me. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, loss of income can be very stressful. Have you been looking for work since then? EOS 3 0 5 Sometimes when I enter a place where my friends are, they tend to go silent when I enter the room. Yes. Its been months now and nothing yet. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Why do you think it is that they go silent? EOS 3 0 7 I' m pretty sure they were talking about me. 2 of myy friends have been helping me with rent money. and I' m pretty sure they must be fed up. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried picking up odd jobs maybe cleaning for someone or helping them move or organize there things? EOS 3 0 9 Yes I have. That' s what helps with feeding and getting some little things at home. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Have you asked them if this is causing problems? EOS 3 0 11 and sometimes I pay back little of what they loan me since I know I cant pay all of it. EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could offer to do some things for them in return for the money so its not like they are just giving it to you. EOS 3 0 13 I' ve playfully asked why did they all go silent when I walked in, but they try changing the topic to something else. I babysit sometimes. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would let them know that i notice it happening and it is starting to concern you and if it is the problem you would gladly do some things for them to earn it rather them just giving it to you to help out.

EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] don' t worry, it' s okay i am used to it. EOS 0 0 14 Has the Pandemic affected your work life at all?. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] not really i' ve always worked from home. what about you? EOS 0 0 16 Not me so much. Business was slow for quite a while because nobody was really working. But it affected my husband, because everytime anyone in our house got sick he had to leave work becase his work didnt allow anybody to be there if anybody in there household was sick.. So he missed quite a bit of work. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that must have been really terrible, i hope you all are coping with that. how did that make you feel? EOS 0 0 18 It was nerve wracking because you never knew how long he was going to be out of work for. his work changed their policy about when he could come back everytime he was out. EOS 0 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] just from talking to you i can see that it was very stressing for you. is he back to work yet? EOS 0 0 20 oh yes it defintely was. he is out again because I just tested positive for COVID. So he will be out of work for two weeks. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] is there any possibility of him getting a vaccine? he seems to be testing positive fairly often. EOS 0 0 22 He has never tested positive. I tested positive. Just anytime you get any kind of sickness his work makes you take time off just in case you have COVID. He has been tested 3 different times and it has always been negative. EOS 0 1 23 [Others] oh sorry for misunderstanding you. EOS 0 0 24 Thats okay. EOS 0 1 25 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] correct me if i' m wrong but sickness causes you nervousness? EOS 0 0 26 most things cause me nervousness. i am a very anxious person. not sure why.. EOS 0 1 27 [Self-disclosure] i am nervous at times too and i usually try to take a break and do something i find comfort in when i feel like that. i can' t imagine how siffucult must be for you to feel like this often. i' m sure you will be able to find a way to relief your anxiety. EOS 0 0 28 Yea i try to do that too. Most times its playing a game on my tablet or phone or something. it is very difficult feelling like this all the time.. I am trying to not let things stress me out as much.. EOS 0 1 29 [Providing Suggestions or Information] playing on your tablet seems like a good way to releive your stresss, do you find it effective? EOS 0 0 30 yes most of the time.. EOS 0 1 31 [Others] that sounds awesome. im proud of you for finding something that calms you down.
3 0 0 hi im sad. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Anything particular got you down? Hello. EOS 3 0 2 just life, bad year. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea bad year for everyone. The virus has really stopped us. Are you working or on layoff. EOS 3 0 4 yes it has, the political turmoil in the United States is very scary as well. I am self employed. but not working alot. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is an understatement with the politics. What do you do. EOS 3 0 6 I am a writer. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I Freelance my self.

3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 3 0 2 well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. My life is done now. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband. EOS 3 0 4 well, I cannot say it is a new start when I will be 90 in March. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Then you' ve definitely got a lot going for you if you' re 90! EOS 3 0 6 Had. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Why did he leave you? EOS 3 0 8 He wanted a younger woman. His new girlfriend is 63. He is 45. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that is more of his problem then. You deserve someone that' s better than leaving someone because of their age. EOS 3 0 10 I thought it would be nice to have a younger man when we got married. He eventually told me he just married me for my money, and was waiting for me to pass so he could inherit all of it. He said he got tired of waiting, so he moved on to someone else. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Personally, if that' s how he felt, then you' re better off. I know that doesn' t stop the hurt you' re feeling, but you are worth more than that. EOS 3 0 12 Now I am here alone. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being single does not mean you' re completely alone. There are a lot of resources to talk to someone and make friends. EOS 3 0 14 I am looking on Tinder for a new friend, but nobody wants someone that is 90. I never used it before, but someone told me about it. Considering I haven' t dated in 25 years. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could you try something like Facebook or Instagram to connect with old friends or acquaintances? EOS 3 0 16 What are those? I heard of them, but never used them. Most of my old friends are no longer around... EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Social networks online, you can connect with family or old coworkers. And post pictures and see what other people are doing with their lives. EOS 3 0 18 I am looking for something quicker, I don' t know how much longer I have. I can' t be spending months waiting for the right person. EOS 3 1 19 [Question] So you' re looking for a strictly romantic relationship? EOS 3 0 20 well.... someone to spend time with. My great grandson said people meet others on Tinder now. Told me I should try it. Have you heard of it or used it? EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Can you go to the park? Maybe visit there to meet new people?

EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I read different postings and have over 30 followers. EOS 3 0 14 awesome, good for you. EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But if you write on Medium you can earn money. EOS 3 0 16 oh i didnt know that. thats cools. i should check it out. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] I ask that about copywriting because I am on LinkedIn. EOS 3 0 18 oh, i dont use it much.

EOS 3 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I enjoy writing and speaking my mind. EOS 3 0 28 same. EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But you are still alive. EOS 3 0 30 as far as I know. EOS 3 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Medium only cost 5 a month and you can make money writing about what you have experienced. EOS 3 0 32 neat, I' ve experienced a lot in my life.

1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Greeting] hi there. How are you? EOS 1 0 2 I am so frustrated. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] May I ask why you are feeling frustrated? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, my school was closed without warning because of COVID. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand how that could make you so frustrated, that would make me frustrated too. I am waiting to hear about my school. EOS 1 0 6 Yes I don' t even know what is going to happen with finals now. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure that whatever happens, you will do well with them. Have you thought about talking to an administrator at your school? EOS 1 0 8 I hope so. But I feel like this could have been handled better. Not yet, there is a waiting list to talk to an academic advisor. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is all the more reason to be frustrated, i commend you for having to deal with that! EOS 1 0 10 Thanks. I feel like my head is going to explode though. The remainder of the semester is going to be online. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about talking to a close friend or someone you trust about these stressors? EOS 1 0 12 Yes, I talked with my friend about it and she said don' t worry. But I can' t help it. EOS 1 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand why are you are worried though, that is a lot honestly. EOS 1 0 14 I was doing so well in my classes too. Very close to graduating. EOS 1 1 15 [Question] Do you think that your grades will go down with the switch to online? EOS 1 0 16 Yes, I don' t do well with online learning. EOS 1 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have seen that be the case for many people. Hopefully your professors will be understanding with the switch. EOS 1 0 18 I hope so too. EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well I really hope that everything goes well for you! You sound like you are prepared.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 0 0 2 Just feeling sad. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad? EOS 0 0 4 Not being able to leave the house with Covid. plus my hours were cut at work. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut. What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time? EOS 0 0 6 Yes it sucks. I live alone now so there really hard sometimes. I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos. Nothing productive. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it' s not the same as face to face. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I have one close friend that I talk to every now and then. Its not like it use to be. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That' s still a win. EOS 0 0 10 We used to be able to go out and have a few beers together.. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. Keep that connection. It' s not going to be the same due to the circumstances. But at least you are seeking to keep that connection, and that is a good thing. EOS 0 0 12 I hope that this vaccine thing is reason and we can get back to the norm.. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it' s not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest. EOS 0 0 14 Good idea.. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well. But I am hoping they get it right, and not just rush to get something out there that may or may not work. EOS 0 0 16 I like to do home repairs. Maybe I can find a group for that. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway. EOS 0 0 18 Do you use any other social media for connecting with new people. EOS 0 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I use Facebook, Instagram, and sometimes TikTok. You should do mini videos on easy things to DIY on TikTok. EOS 0 0 20 True. I have to change out a few old style electrical plugs. Maybe I can do something on that? EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] right! That is a great idea! EOS 0 0 22 I saw a few TikTok videos but never post a video. Is it hard to post on there? EOS 0 1 23 [Self-disclosure] not really. what i do is record the video beforehand, and then upload it. EOS 0 0 24 Oh. Okay. EOS 0 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] But you can also record it straight to the app. You can also do the same on SnapChat.
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling pretty good right now.. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk to me about? EOS 4 0 3 I have a friend who knew me since I was little. She is a little older than me. She still treat me like I' m still little. I tried to explain to her that I' m a grown woman and I grew out of lot of things when I was a kid.. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Is she listening to you? I know how it feels to be patronised by people who are older. EOS 4 0 5 She still didn' t get it. I want our relationship to move further but with her like this. I feel sad. Is there anything I can do? EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Well, if she is not listening to you when you try to talk to her you have to ask yourself whether the relationship is really worth it?
2 0 0 Hey. I am really scared about my job prospects. I am really fearful about my job situation. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] When did this fear start? EOS 2 0 2 It has been a while. I have had fears going back to my childhood traumas. I think that the work situation has only exacerbated that. The current economic climate has really made me fearful.... not sure if I am going to be able to keep my job. EOS 2 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct? EOS 2 0 4 Somewhat. But, my fears are relevant because I don' t know if I will always have a job. EOS 2 1 5 [Question] Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job?
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 im feeling pretty sad today. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 4 0 3 its about me and my friend got fight for misunderstanding. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like your feelings are hurt over a misunderstanding you had with a friend is this correct? EOS 4 0 5 yeah thats correct. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] I see i am sorry that it has you feeling down, did you try to talk with your friend to see if you could resolve your feelings? EOS 4 0 7 no he was not responding to me. he just avoiding me. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe you could send him a message on social media and let him know the argument has your feelings hurt and you would like to try to talk about it when he has time. EOS 4 0 9 thanks but he totally avoiding me he just blocked me and he ignore me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] how long have you been friends with him? EOS 4 0 11 for 5 years. but he thinks that i have affair with his girlfriend. EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] oh yea that can make things difficult, but i think if you keep reaching out you may could talk this over. Did you try to explain to him that his thoughts were not true? EOS 4 0 13 yeah but how should i start because he misjudged me and his girlfriend its a sensitive issue. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would start off by telling him that you were sorry that he had those thoughts but there is no truth to it and the fact that he does not trust you enough to know that is hurtful to you and her. If that does not work then you might need to take some time to reflect and figure out if that is a friendship worth trying to save, you may find yourself better off without a friend who shows no trust in you. EOS 4 0 15 please give me some suggegtion that what should i do now. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would continue trying to reach out to him and until you can get in touch with him maybe find some thing to do to occupy your mind as to where it does not bother you so much. do you have any hobbies? EOS 4 0 17 yeah i like to play football. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe go play some football to get your mind off of it. EOS 4 0 19 yeah sure. EOS 4 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] from chatting with you seem like a nice person, try not to let it get you down. EOS 4 0 21 now im feeling well because of you. EOS 4 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] i am glad i could be of some help!
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am very sorry to hear that. What are you sad about? EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently?
3 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you. EOS 3 0 1 Not doing well. I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Oh no, how long had you been together? EOS 3 0 3 we were together for 2 years. It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Wow, that' s horrible. How do you feel about it? EOS 3 0 5 I feel lost. I' m so used to her being around everyday. Now I don' t know what to do with myself without her. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year. EOS 3 0 7 Not only that, but with Covid going on I have noone i can see to talk about it. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have any family? EOS 3 0 9 Yes, i do, but they are far away. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Friends closeby? Hobbies? What kind of work do you do? EOS 3 0 11 I do have friends, who are also friends with her. However they have families and do not visit prople because of covid. I don' t have any true hobbies. I don' t think they will fill the void anyways. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow. EOS 3 0 13 I do software development, but its a work at home situation. So i have been just by myself for the last week, and its driving me crazy. All i do is think about why she would do that. I' ve had time to myself but its not getting any better. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have always tried to think of things in a positive way. This way even when something really bad happens, it doesn' t seem so bad as to overwhelm us from recovering. EOS 3 0 15 What positive are there here? EOS 3 1 16 [Question] I' m actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it? Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren' t hurting for money. EOS 3 0 17 It' s ok. pays the bills. But my job is pretty independent. so i don' t even get to meet new people. I am usually home, while she was always out of the house during the day. EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can use that stress that has been building up to find a new outlet for the stress. EOS 3 0 19 what, you want to break stuff to relieve stress. EOS 3 1 20 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. My wife used to think I was just playing on the computer all day, lol. I run. Every morning, I jog about 2 miles. It is awesome to get the blood going and a great way to start the day. EOS 3 0 21 That sound like something i could give a try. any other seggestions? EOS 3 1 22 [Others] I feel so much more relaxed after running and it seems that nothing can hurt me after that. EOS 3 0 23 Well, i' m going try going for a run right now. Thanks for the suggestion. I' ll see if that helps. EOS 3 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I do know how a programming job can take away from some social aspects of your life, maybe try and go to a bar, or somewhere social to get out some. No problem, I hope I have helped you some. Happy Holidays! EOS 3 0 25 Appreciate the talk, and suggestions. I' ll give it a try. Have a great night. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Good night.
3 0 0 I am feeling depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about your feelings? EOS 3 0 2 I feel lost and lonely, i do not know what to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] When did these feelings come about. EOS 3 0 4 They came about when i lost my job in August of this year. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can understand where your coming from with that, especially since this pandemic occurred. EOS 3 0 6 Yes, finances have especially been very tight. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] it seems like this could be overwhelming to you and trying to figure out the right path to go forward. EOS 3 0 8 It is, have you ever encountered such a situation in your life? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I can relate to you in this situation 100% and if it wasnt for me stepping out on faith and opening my own practice, I wouldnt be here now. EOS 3 0 10 How did you snap out of the situation, did you have some savings? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Always putting money aside when able, and doing lots of research about first time businesses gave a lot of insights. Have you tried to look into things like that yourself? EOS 3 0 12 Yes, i have been researching a lot too but it is difficult given that i have been surviving on the savings i had. Also it is very difficult to get a loan currently. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] That I do understand as well. This pandemic has made it hard for everyone. Are you a parent with any little ones by chance?
4 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 4 0 2 I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age? EOS 4 0 4 He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough, both for you and him. I know it' s meaningless to tell you not to be sad, however, you can think that he' s not in a better place. EOS 4 0 6 I presume you mean now and not not;). Though I simply am not a believer. It just made me think how meaningless life was.. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn' t it? I sometimes think it' s meaningless too. EOS 4 0 8 I do not really know what to do about my feelings. They are not going away. EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I feel you, coping with losing your loved ones is never easy. In fact, it' s confusing when you grieve and even when you recover and move on. EOS 4 0 10 Do you think that people ever really recover from a significant bereavement? I think that what you said there was very wise. Maybe it' s worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened.. there is guilt that comes with that. EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t think people can completely get over that, you just get used to the pain of not having them around. EOS 4 0 12 Whilst it hurts to think about him being dead, I think that it would hurt more if I had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I just need you to know that whatever your feeling is, it' s completely normal and you shouldn' t feel guilty for having it.

EOS 1 0 2 yes. i invited my friend over to watch my new puppy while i painted my room because my dog has seperation anxiety and can' t be alone. then she showed up with her new boyfriend. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] What bothered you about that? EOS 1 0 4 well i dont know him and my stuff was all out in the living room where he was alone for most of the day. i actually didnt suspect anything would happen at first. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can see why that would upset you though. Did something happen?

3 1 0 [Greeting] hello!! EOS 3 0 1 I am very depressed. I found out that my girlfriend is cheating on me with my friend! EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] that' s really bad. even I was also in the same situation. EOS 3 0 3 I have been with her for close to 2 years and now she has been cheating me right under my nose for the past few months! how foolish of me to blindly trust her... How did you deal with it? EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] To be honest i was not completely came out it since it was 3 years but now i somehow getting better i tried to divert myself from the thoughts engage myself with other friends spend more time with my family like that. try to divert yourself, keep yourself busy, spend more time with family, try to minimize the usage of mobile.
3 1 0 [Question] hi how' s it going today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today. EOS 3 0 2 I feel bad putting this on your shoulders, maybe you can help. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] i have big shoulders! whats on your mind? EOS 3 0 4 I' m just struggling a lot to find the motivation to do anything at all, even the most basic of things. Sometimes I get very intense feelings of sadness and just want to drop everything I' m doing, like I can' t do anything more. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] i think a lot of people are feeling that way these past few months. do you think it is covid related? not sickness, more depression. EOS 3 0 6 Yes that' s very true, depression is probably hitting people the worst right now. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] its becoming a new normal lol. EOS 3 0 8 No I' ve been fighting depression since I was probably like 12 years old, it first really hit me when I moved from where I was living all my life and lost all my friends and I was terrified. Now I' m 29. But covid definitely plays a factor. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] a few months ago i was feeling the same way. i dont have health insurance but googled and found some online docturs. i got to see a doc and get on antidepressants for less than a hundred. covid plays a factor in EVERYTHING ugh. EOS 3 0 10 So you had the therapy session online with them via webcam or you found them online first then went to see them in person. Yeah covid is doing damage in more ways than one. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] all online!:) meds shipped to my door. i love it! EOS 3 0 12 Wow that' s great. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] theres a free site called 7 cups that does free peer to peer couseling too. its good when i have a lot on my mind. EOS 3 0 14 I would have to do it in person, I don' t want people I live with to hear about all my pathetic mental problems. Oh 7 cups, I had an account there and met a really nice girl there that was helping me and she was living with an abusive family at the same time, its crazy but now I can' t access that account anymore, I' m so sad about that. I think it says the account doesn' t exist when I try to login now. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] can you make a new one? EOS 3 0 16 Sure I guess I' ll have to do that but I really wanted to get back into that account, don' t want to lose contact with that girl that was helping me. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] cerebral is that one site with the cheap docs. EOS 3 0 18 do you mean um.... cheap med? cerebral seems to be an antidepressant when i googled. EOS 3 1 19 [Others] check the website q and a. EOS 3 0 20 oh wait nevermind i spoke too soon. EOS 3 1 21 [Others] for cups maybe thers a contact you can email to try to regain access. EOS 3 0 22 Yeah definitely, I should try contacting their support to try and restore my account. EOS 3 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] they are doing so much things now, you just gotta get on google and see whats out there! i think you are going to be okay, there are definately tough times but you seem to have a grip on knowing what you need. that is great. EOS 3 0 24 Yeah, I gotta do therapy thats a must and I think it has to be in person so I can try to let some of it out with someone face to face....... but that' s going to be very hard, to trust someone and open up about everything because its not just depression. Online is convenient but its just too much going on. EOS 3 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i agree, just with all the covid crap i know it can be hard to get a face to face!:) EOS 3 0 26 Right... EOS 3 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] its great that you know what you need to do though adn that you know what helps. is there anytihng else you want to talk about? EOS 3 0 28 Ah I don' t know it' s too much, I don' t want to make this hours long. But thank you for talking a little bit about it with me and sharing those resources. Hopefully I can find a' natural' way to fix these things without taking meds that might change who I am for the worst or something. Hope you have a nice night and stay healthy, you and your family. EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] hang in there! EOS 3 0 30 Thanks, you too, bye. EOS 3 1 31 [Greeting] nice talking to you!
2 0 0 Good evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hi, how' s things?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! What can I do to help? EOS 0 0 1 Hello, I' m not sure if there is any help? Without knowing when I can return to work, I will probably remain anxious about the unknown. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m glad to speak to you today. It sounds like you are having anxious thoughts. Can you tell me more? EOS 0 0 3 i am self employed, selling event tickets on the internet, but because of covid, all events are postponed until it is safe to gather in large numbers. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how you might feel anxious. There are lots of uncertainties right now. I am sorry you are going through this. Are you able to find work or help from the government? EOS 0 0 5 thank you; fortunately, i have been able to collect unemployment assistance, especially created for self employed people during this difficult time. however, that is due to expire in a few weeks, so once again i am growing anxious about finances. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Living with uncertainties can make anyone feel anxious. Have you tried getting outdoors for a small walk or hike?. EOS 0 0 7 yes, I try to walk outdoors every day, for at least 30 minutes. it does help a lot. but with the weather turning colder, that may be difficult to continue. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It is so important during stressful life events to take care of our minds and bodies. It sounds like you have been making good choices! Have you reached out to family or friends for advice or perhaps help with supplemental employment? EOS 0 0 9 not yet; it is very difficult for me to ask for help. But I may need to do so in the near future. I am fortunate to have a close network of family and friends that I can count on. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am happy to hear you have support during this time.
3 0 0 I am so stressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi, what' s going on? EOS 3 0 2 I have a college course in the evening, but I cannot concentrate while distance learning. I am expected to watch the instructor do excel on a tiny phone screen and follow along. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oooff that sounds brutal... especially the excel part! do you have a bigger screen you can use? EOS 3 0 4 It is stressful. I am able to pull up zoom on my laptop, but it is almost more cumbersome because I must switch back and forth. I have to also manipulate an excel as well as watch the instructor. My colleagues in the class are annoying, because they do not know how to use mute correctly. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have access to a second screen or have the ability to stream the class on your tv through chromecast or something? EOS 3 0 6 I don' t have a second screen, but I do have a large TV. I may be able to hook it up via HDMI. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The mute thing is horrible. I have no ideas for that. hahah. I' m looking for help with that too! Yeah try the HDMI hook up you can sometimes find cheap attachements on amazon if you don' t have the right connections. EOS 3 0 8 Sometimes I get really anxious. My ears will be pounding and I feel like I can' t hear anything. It is worse when using in ears, because it' s like all I can hear is my heartbeat. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yeah if you stream it on your tv, you won' t have to wear headphones... that way you can control the volume better too.
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic?
4 1 0 [Question] Hello there, can I help you with any today?* anything. I am happy to talk to you about any problem that you might be having? EOS 4 0 1 I am having such a difficult time today!!! EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you. EOS 4 0 3 I think that my boyfriend is cheating on me again!!! EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Are you saying that he has cheated on you before? That does not sound very promising. EOS 4 0 5 He has but it was a long time ago and was before we had a talk about exclusivity in our relationship but it still hurt. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Have you considered getting some sort of couples counselling? Or do you just think that he is never going to change? EOS 4 0 7 We tried counselling once.. It was online and we got paid to do it.. I don' t think he took it seriously at the time. He always said he felt like he was being attacked. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. So you feel that he is not really taking your problems as a couple seriously? EOS 4 0 9 Yes. I feel he thinks of me as some sort of trophy and he does not have to work now that he won me over in the first place. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have been in toxic relationships before and to be honest it does sound a little as though this is one of those situations. EOS 4 0 11 I have been as well but this time was supposed to be different. At first everything was great but now things are so distant I just don' t know what to do next. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you feel that perhaps it might be time to move on? People who will cheat twice are pretty unlikely to ever change their ways. EOS 4 0 13 That is true. But now we have a kid together and I feel like it would break her heart to lose her dad. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah you did not mention that! Maybe for the sake of your child it might be worth going to counselling again then. EOS 4 0 15 Maybe but a place that we won' t get paid to go... I think he thought of it as a job or something. I got a lot out of the experience and still use the skills to this day. But with a unresponsive partner those skills will not work.. Can you recomend a good site to find affordable services? EOS 4 1 16 [Question] You could ask your doctor to recommend something that will not cost you too much but will be effective? EOS 4 0 17 That is a great idea I had not thought of asking my dr. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] They should be able to provide you with a list of reputable services local to you. I hope that I have managed to be of some use to you today! EOS 4 0 19 absolutely best advice I have gotten in a while. It was nice talking to you. EOS 4 1 20 [Greeting] Nice talking to you too, enjoy your day!
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health?
0 0 0 Hello, I' m having a terrible day. My name is Sean and I work for a large distribution company. EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] hi! i' m sorry to hear that. how is your work going so far. EOS 0 0 2 The problem with a job like Amazon or Kehe distribution is the quotas. The pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID? EOS 0 0 4 no COVID 19 has nothing to do with any of this work. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how anxious you are right now. Can you give me some more info on your job. EOS 0 0 6 well when there are 50 million americans out of work right it' s a bit scary. i' m a forklift operator..... I move pallets from one area of the warehouse to another but i. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i totally understand how nerve wrecking this is, but trust me you guys being front - line workers are our real heros. EOS 0 0 8 am based on a quota. I am suppose to be able to move 10 pallets per hour. that' s almost impossible as it is a 1 million square foot warehouse. If i get a pallet on the west side and have to move it to the east side that takes 7 - 10 minutes even if your going dangerously fast. doesn' t feel like it to me. EOS 0 1 9 [Question] did you try discussing your concerns with your Team Lead/ Warehouse Supervisor of your group. EOS 0 0 10 I feel like a replaceable cog in a giant machine that doesn' t give two shits whether I show up for work or not despite having over five years experience with over 12 forklifts..... Yes and they always say the same thing. You need to get your numbers up but it' s a catch 22 you can' t possibly safely get your numbers up and accomplish your quotas. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are doing your best and are working really hard. EOS 0 0 12 so. EOS 0 1 13 [Question] just a thought - did you try changing roles within the warehouse to a different position? or try checking with the manager regarding this. you have 5 years exp, i' m sure you deserve a better role and pay. EOS 0 0 14 I am a felon and I have a bachelores degree in business management. I am desperately trying to get out of the quota based work areas. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] i understand, but when i had a slight trouble with my job, talking to my manager helped me a lot. also, your manager is your best point of contact for a great reference. EOS 0 0 16 Do you know how incredibly hard it is to serve your time in jail for 3 years and get out and can' t find a job except scrubbing floors or cleaning shit or servinge tables. my manager doesn' t give a shit. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] thats hard,.. but you can do it. EOS 0 0 18 do what. work at burger king for$ 7. 25 an hour. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] do your best in your job! hard work ultimately pays off!
1 1 0 [Question] hi. how can i help you? EOS 1 0 1 hi. i am really angry. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] are you saying that you are angry now? what happened dear? EOS 1 0 3 really angry at my friend. EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] can you tell me what happened so that i can understand? EOS 1 0 5 i told him a secret about my self in private and he played a stupid pranks that reveals it to other people i don' t like. EOS 1 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s ok dear. did you asked him why he did that? EOS 1 0 7 he said he was drunk. EOS 1 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] just remember, yesterday is gone. there is really nothing you can do about the situation. you better keep your distance from that particular person. EOS 1 0 9 ok. and i already keep my distance from him. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] learn from your mistake and don' t do it again dear. EOS 1 0 11 yes i won' t. funny thing is he didn' t remember what he did that night. EOS 1 1 12 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah. we can' t control others. right? EOS 1 0 13 absolutely.

3 0 0 Hello, I' ve been really depressed lately and feel like there isn' t anything I can do to break this feeling. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened? EOS 3 0 2 November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS( its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 4 Yes that is correct. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest. EOS 3 0 6 I know I' m not alone and that' s what makes it hard to reach out, because I don' t want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there' s. It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do. It seems that you don' t want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person. EOS 3 0 8 I just don' t know what to do about it anymore. Yes, I don' t like to bother others or let other people down. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure. Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief? Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think? EOS 3 0 10 It is a lot, I' m used to being the person that everyone comes to for help, but I am not very good at asking for help myself. I have seen a doctor and they started my new medicine regimen but unfortunately there is no cure for this disease. I was going to physical therapy but finished that right as Covid started.. Plus it does get better as the weather gets warmer so the winter has been hard, really looking forward to spring and summer for a little relief. EOS 3 1 11 [Others] I' m sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now. EOS 3 0 12 I' d be open to doing Yoga once things open back up, but having this disease puts me in a high risk category so my interaction outside the home still has to remain limited until we develop some heard immunity. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know. Sunshine is always best cure for a better mood. Did you try to maybe walk or drive around your neighborhood for some fresh air? Oh, then drive around might be the only option. EOS 3 0 14 I' m hoping to get out and go for walks once the weather warms up, unfortunately right now there is still some snow on the ground and it' s not quite warn yet being in the northeast. EOS 3 1 15 [Others] Ye. You did the right choice. Safety is always the first concern. EOS 3 0 16 I did take walks along the path in our development last summer so the cabin fever wasn' t as bad as it seems to be with all the snow that basically kept me inside all of february. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Does where you live have a online social activity group on FB or an app called Neighbors? That could be a good way to communicate with others in a safe way. EOS 3 0 18 The local FB group is only full of everyone complaining about everyone else( seems when everyone is home things seem to get on peoples nerves more so then when people could get away from home consistently) but I' ve never heard of the app Neighbors, I' ll have to look into that. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Give that a try. Maybe you will meet some friends there.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you today? EOS 3 0 1 hi i am okay, a little bit sad though. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Okay. I am very sorry to hear that! Do you want to tell me more about that? EOS 3 0 3 Well with the holidays coming up i have been very stressed and nervous about what i am going to do. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really feel you there. Holidays are so hard.. especially with the way this year has been. Anything specific?. EOS 3 0 5 Yes. I am a college student and I live on campus. The day before I moved in my dad said some unforgivable things to me and we haven' t spoke since. I have no choice but to go live at home over the break but I am very scared about it. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Do you feel scared for your own self? Or of the situation in general? I' m sorry to hear that. Relationships with parents can be very difficult sometimes.. I' m around college age as well and also live at home. So I can understand your struggle.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all.
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, what brings you to bring the seeker? EOS 6 0 1 I feel upset with myself over my situation. Did you read it? EOS 6 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I did not see it. What is your situation? I am here to listen. EOS 6 0 3 I feel ashamed of my depression symptoms. I feel other people are ashamed of me. EOS 6 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how? EOS 6 0 5 I just can' t live reguarly life like" healthy" people do and they notice my symptoms. They don' t understand how your mind can be your enemy. EOS 6 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are saying that you can' t live regularly and people don' t understand that your mind isn' t working in your favor. Is that right? Can you tell me what you mean by your mind being your enemy? EOS 6 0 7 Like I have no interest or motivation to do ANYTHING some days. Hard to even take care of my hygiene. My mind doesn' t care to do it even when it' s embarrasing for people to notice. EOS 6 1 8 [Greeting] That sounds very hard. I can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn' t want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself. What do you do to cope? EOS 6 0 9 stay away from mean people, stop tryiig to explain my symptoms to others who won' t get it. EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That makes sense why you would want to avoid doing these things, which is a good thing, but is there anything that you try to do that isn' t avoidance? Something that approaches something?
3 0 0 Hi, how' s your day going? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello. Im doing good. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 2 Not so good unfortunately. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why. Can you talknto me about it? EOS 3 0 4 Due to this pandemic, I am fearful for my job security and future in general. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how are you feeling. Its not that easy going through this pandemic. EOS 3 0 6 There is currently a lock down in my area. It seems like things are getting worse. My anxiety is high. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how are you feeling. Im kind of going in the same situation. But you have to keep calm. You have to look things at this way, maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home. I believe God put us in this situation to appreciate more our surroundings. EOS 3 0 8 I doubt it will get better, but thanks for the positive vibes. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you ever try to talk to your love one at home? Or maybe take time to communicate more with your friends? EOS 3 0 10 No, but I' ve been taking medication for my depression. Any suggestion on activities to help me past time? EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Well i dont know when this is going to end but if we let this isolation win the we are going to get worse. So I would recommend to share time with your love one and clear your mind and take out all the negative things away. Right now Im talking a lot with my brother and me and him never get along. So this is a huge step.
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing. EOS 6 0 8 Yeah, people don' t know that just because my two friends go" Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two( so - called) friends? EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] definatly not... have you tried explaining your situation to them? EOS 6 0 10 No, they don' t know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID - 19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time? EOS 6 0 12 I might be able to do that. EOS 6 1 13 [Others] unfortunatly it is right now very comen this situation, so no shame for that, EOS 6 0 14 Well, I used to donate a LOT in year' s past. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] a lot of times donating time to help organisatiosn is more valuable then money. EOS 6 0 16 Great point. EOS 6 1 17 [Others] times and situations change so thats ok. EOS 6 0 18 My friends may like to know that I am trading time.... instead of donating money. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i worked for a non profit and the biggest struggle was to find volunteers to help out. EOS 6 0 20 Yes, you make a good point. EOS 6 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I feel that is a great donation and if they do not like that tell them money is easy to give time not. EOS 6 0 22 The proble is that some people just want to shame people without knowing their plight. EOS 6 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, true, we need to stay above them then in all actuality we don' t know what goes on behind closed doors in their life. sometimes people like that reflect. EOS 6 0 24 I need to think of others ways to contribute that won' t have my friends hating on me. I have pride, too. EOS 6 1 25 [Others] BUt it should be what you want not what your' freinds want. you should be proud of yourself.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, is there anything I can help you with today? EOS 4 0 1 I am really depressed because of my recent break up. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Oh no, that is really sad. I know break ups can be very hard.. EOS 4 0 3 yeah. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel you are depressed about it? Were you together a long time? EOS 4 0 5 i was with her for more then 2 years and without her everthing seems incomplete. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I completely understand. I have had break ups too. They are never easy. EOS 4 0 7 what should i do now? EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Well, if the break up is still fresh, it will take some time before you start feeling yourself again. Breaking up with someone can be as devastating as a death. Because you mourn the loss of the person. What do you think you could do to help yourself feel better? EOS 4 0 9 that is very true. what i need right now is to distract my mind and think about something else. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] What kind of hobbies do you have? Or are you involved in sports or any type of other activities that you enjoy? EOS 4 0 11 i mostly play soccer. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That could be a great distraction. You could start practicing soccer again. You definitely have more time for it now. Do you have anyone you can talk to about the break up? Sometimes talking with a close friend or family member can help a lot too. EOS 4 0 13 I have my best friend and he is also helping me recover but my main issue is inner will power. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] Why do you say that? Are you focused on trying to get back with them? EOS 4 0 15 My mind is just not accepting the change. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] That is difficult. What caused the break up? Was it mutual? Or was it one sided? EOS 4 0 17 it was one sided and that is why it' s so problematic. anyways. EOS 4 1 18 [Question] Ok, so your ex broke up with you. Did they give you a reason why? Or did they just say it' s over and that was it? EOS 4 0 19 yeah. I' ll try my best to do what i can. EOS 4 1 20 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is a hard one. I had a boyfriend and he cheated on me with another girl and he broke up with me because I would not do things with him that I was uncomfortable with. What do you think you could do to change your mindset? I know for me, writing helps a lot.
0 1 0 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today? EOS 0 0 1 I am so stressed out because my business has suffered this year. I am very worried I may have to close and I won' t be able to pay my bills. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is really tough. a lot of people are going through that, you are not alone. what kind of business do you have? EOS 0 0 3 I sell cosmetics. I think a lot of people don' t have money to buy non essential items right now. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] christmas is right around the corner though, and it is almost the 15th. military get paid the 1st and 15th so there is still hope for a christmas rush! tax season is right around the corner too... there is defineately still reason to keep hope. EOS 0 0 5 That might be true. I just don' t know that business will ever recover. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you online or in store? EOS 0 0 7 Mostly online. EOS 0 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] thats great then, online businesses are less likely to fail. you know, i am in construction and there are soo many zoom meetings. honestly, i was in an office with 4 people and hardly wore make up. now with all these meetings i amd doing meetings constantly and i have had to start wearing more make up to look more profesional. i know it can be scry, but you ust have to keep a positive attitude.
3 1 0 [Question] hi how' s it going today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you? EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future? EOS 3 0 5 Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it' s true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online? EOS 3 0 7 Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression. EOS 3 0 9 How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] the" little black rain cloud" people? LOL I try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it' s our first. EOS 3 0 11 Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] While there is a lot to focus on that is just awful, it has really helped me to look back to the spanish flue of 1918. that pandemic was followed byt he roaring 20s.
4 0 0 hi. hello!!??!!?? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] hello. EOS 4 0 2 hi. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I apologize I was having a sneezing fit! What is on your mind today?
0 0 0 Hello. Feeling low today. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it. EOS 0 0 2 I' ve been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn' t go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint? EOS 0 0 4 Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don' t have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions. EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress. EOS 0 0 6 Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products. I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. Challenging face - to - face, and I have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now. What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing. EOS 0 0 8 Thanks. It helps to know that I' m not alone. Most often, I work independently my work. Involves a lot of explaining and justification. Before we just all sat in the same room and worked together. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don' t convey the meaning 100 percent. EOS 0 0 10 So, perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues? EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would personally suggest more happy hours, in case you haven' t already done so. EOS 0 0 12 Ah, something more casual? EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Holiday care packages would also be a good common ground for folks to gather around over something that is not work.
4 0 0 Hi. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing these days? EOS 4 0 2 Not good. You? EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry to hear that. I am doing fine and hope I can cheer you up. EOS 4 0 4 Good to hear. Been feeling lonely due to this pandemic. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I totally understand it. I felt lonely too by staying home all the time. But I found we can borrow books online. A good book can really help.
1 0 0 Hello I am having pro\ blems with a friend. EOS 1 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so so sorry to hear that. What has been going on? EOS 1 0 2 Sometimes she is very friendly, but sometimes she is super rude. In a way that is so rude that it has never happened before by someone who I consider a friend. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh wow, it sounds like shes not a very good frined. EOS 1 0 4 As nice as she is, every once in a while show will be equally nasty. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Have you tried talking to her about it? EOS 1 0 6 Super snarky comments. Yes I have tried. But it still continues. EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried seperating from her?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability. EOS 3 0 21 i applied for disability but didn' t get it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, I' m here to listen. What' s going on? EOS 0 0 1 Thank you. I' ve lost my job and I' m very nervous about the future. As a result I am having a hard time sleeping. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Wow, that' s very hard. I would be anxious too. EOS 0 0 3 That makes me feel a lot better. Have you ever lost your job? EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I have. I was laid off. It was nerve - racking, but also really sad. EOS 0 0 5 What helped you get through it? EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I had a bit in savings, but I looked for new jobs mostly. I was on unemployment insurance for about a month before I found a new job. Have you made any plans yet about how to move forward? I can offer some suggestions if you would like. I know about a lot of resources. EOS 0 0 7 I am a gig worker, so I cannot apply for IU. Its very hard, but i also have some savings. What kind of tools would you recommend I use to get through this. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, falling back on savings while you look for more work is good for a while. If you have any food insecurity as a result, there are often local food banks. It' s really not something to be embarrased about, so many people face food insecurity through no fault of their own. You could also give a call to your local social services because they will be able to tell you what resources would be available, whether it' s a vocational program or temporary assistance. EOS 0 0 9 Wow you' re so helpful and encouraging! It' s very nice to talk to you.. Are there any meds you can recommend to help me sleep? EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, if it' s possible, I would talk to a doctor. If you' re looking for Over - the - counter sleep medication, melatonin has helped me in the past. EOS 0 0 11 Wow! I' ve never used melatonin before. Did it really help you? Are you doing much better now? EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] It defiitely helps me fall asleep. It' s a natural sleep aid. If something like that doesn' t work, I would talk to a doctor. I know money will be tight though. Are there any free clinics near you?. EOS 0 0 13 I' ll look into it. There' s a lot of services in the general area that might be able to help me. It' s been really nice talking to you. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Thank you. I hope you' re feeling a bit better. Is there anything else you want to talk about? EOS 0 0 15 No I' m okay. I think that' s everything:) EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Alright, well I hope you have a good night. Good luck, you' ve got this! EOS 0 0 17 You too:) Thanks< 3. EOS 0 1 18 [Greeting] Bye!
1 0 0 Hello I am having pro\ blems with a friend. EOS 1 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so so sorry to hear that. What has been going on? EOS 1 0 2 Sometimes she is very friendly, but sometimes she is super rude. In a way that is so rude that it has never happened before by someone who I consider a friend. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh wow, it sounds like shes not a very good frined. EOS 1 0 4 As nice as she is, every once in a while show will be equally nasty. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Have you tried talking to her about it?
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state. EOS 0 0 6 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well. EOS 0 0 8 Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing( which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all. I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out. EOS 0 0 10 What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job: it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. Working there would be ministry, not typical work. And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, that' s a big deal. i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it. EOS 0 0 12 Thank you. I believe there are three things in my favor: I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current( related) job fifteen years ago. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] even by working there, you will surely meet new friends. do you know many people from the church? EOS 0 0 14 We worked together for almost 13 years before she retired, but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer/ work partner? I know a few of the higher ups from the area churches, and a handful of families. I know half the core staff I would be working with daily and think of them as extended family.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you just have to be patient and don' t push it too hard so that you won' t look desperate. EOS 0 0 16 The benefits are nice, also, such as staff are provided meals prepared by the banquet chef and his team when at work. And though everyone has a role, the office staff support each other well and work as a team. EOS 0 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, banquet at work. that is a wonderland stuff. EOS 0 0 18 At the risk of preaching religion, I believe God may be calling me to serve there.. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is definitely a dream job. God is everywhere. just put your trust in Him. He never sleep nor slumber. EOS 0 0 20 When off duty, staff are encouraged to enjoy the facilities and mingle with guests. There is an Olympic sized pool, field games, a gymnasium, an exercise room, and if off duty, one can attend most any of the events on the campus, unless designated as a private event. EOS 0 1 21 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow! Olympic size pool. Keep praying. the job is yours. EOS 0 0 22 Because my job is to sell repeat business, it is essential that I get out and meet guests and make certain that their needs are met, but it usually comes in the form of serving snacks at intermission and saying hellos as one passes. It would feel like a family reunion, but in a family where everyone gets along. EOS 0 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] that is good, i work in such place where everyone is like a family. EOS 0 0 24 The music events year round are outstanding. They have many well known names in Christian music as well as speakers who are well worth hearing. To be able to hear these messages at no cost makes the job priceless. EOS 0 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i can feel your excitement.
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married?
0 1 0 [Question] hello how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hello I am taking a break from my studies to talk. I am fine thanks. Hope you are doing well also. I am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines. EOS 0 1 2 [Self-disclosure] i am fine thanks for asking. EOS 0 0 3 two exams and two assignments due at the end of this and next month. that' s good. EOS 0 1 4 [Others] Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful.
0 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? I am feeling rather sad. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hi there. Yes, What is making you sad? EOS 0 0 2 I feel that my friends do not like me very much any more. Apparently they have been engaging in group activities without me. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities. EOS 0 0 4 Do you think that I am over - reacting? I do not want to sound over sensitive but this has been happening for a while. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you talked with your friends on how you feel? When was the last time you all connected? EOS 0 0 6 We went out for coffee the other day and I thought about saying something cos I know they went to a club without me last weekend but I couldn' t bring myself to in the end. EOS 0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand it is tough to bring up what is bothering you, especially after getting to hang out with all your friend over coffee. I' m sure this was not intentional with not inviting you to the club. EOS 0 0 8 Sometimes in the past I have turned down invitations to go out clubbing, admittedly. Could it be that they just did not think that I wanted to go?. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] From what I have experienced personally, I am not a fan of clubs and didnt want to go with my friends. After turning them down a few times, they stopped inviting as well. I think they thought that was not my thing. EOS 0 0 10 The thing is though that this is not the only thing - they have been to rock concerts without me too. I just feel I am no longer a part of the group. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I feel how this is hurting you. The best thing would be to talk to them about feeling disinvited to group activities. Let them know you are still free and really want to spend some time together. Do you think you can open up to them on whats bothering you?
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 6 0 1 hi. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing? EOS 6 0 3 Well I' m distraught. EOS 6 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel that way? EOS 6 0 5 Because my girlfriend has left me. EOS 6 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard for you. I haven' t personally had to deal with that, but I have had friends that have. How long were you together?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 hi. Could you please help?. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How are you tonight?. EOS 3 0 3 I am okay. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 3 0 5 I caught my gf texting another guy. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So from what I understand, you caught your significant other texting someone else.. EOS 3 0 7 yes right. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] What types of things was she texting him about? EOS 3 0 9 Asking about what he was doing later. What he likes to do for fun. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Just from the few messages we have sent, I can tell you are very anxious and upset about this situation.. EOS 3 0 11 yes for sure, i was so shocked and disappointed. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand this as I had issues with my ex fiancé texting other guys and cheating on me.. EOS 3 0 13 Oh no! thats horrible too. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how hard a situation like this is, but I know you can get through it! EOS 3 0 15 Thanks so much! I think I can too. Thanks for sharing with me. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to have a conversation with her about it? EOS 3 0 17 No I feel like she should come to me about it since she was caught. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] What if she doesn' t know you caught her? EOS 3 0 19 I saw her do it. She didn' t really say a whole lot, she just left right afterwards. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think it would definitely help to talk to her about it, it is never good to let situations like this build up without being talked about.. EOS 3 0 21 That' s probably true, just a bit awkward. EOS 3 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I can definitely understand the awkwardness of the conversation, it was tough for me to have that conversation as well.. EOS 3 0 23 And I agree about making sure I talk with her. It' s not healthy. EOS 3 1 24 [Others] It is definitely not healthy.
1 0 0 Hi. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello though, how has life been treating you lately? EOS 1 0 2 It' s been a pretty crazy year. I' m mostly bummed because of my work. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It has been a really weird year hasn' t it? Don' t worry, I think it' s been the same for all of us. Would you like to tell me more details?
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? I' d love to chat with you! What' s been on your mind? EOS 3 0 1 oh hello. I' m having problems with friends - or more precisely the lack of them. I don' t have any. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see. You feel as though you don' t have any friend' s currently? I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It' s so hard to see people and keep relationships right now. EOS 3 0 3 Well it' s more that I think I' ve never had friends. Not anyone I can confide in or laugh with. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a really hard thing to be going through. I' m sorry to hear that. Do you have any really close family members that you are able to confide in? EOS 3 0 5 I don' t think I' d want to let them know how unhappy I am to be honest. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Oh I see. Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn' t have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out! IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it' s 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do. I actually found a couple close friends through apps like that. Have you heard about those or looked into them?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely?
4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 tired. and u? EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like an exhausting time for a lot of people right now. I' m also a bit tired but doing OK. What' s been on your mind recently? EOS 4 0 3 just trying to finish this semester. EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like a stressful time to be in college. How have you been coping with everything going on?
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. EOS 6 0 1 hello. how are you? I wanted to briefly chat about my jealous feeling. My friend sent me a pic as a greeting showing her hubby and I am jealous. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] I am doing good. How are you? EOS 6 0 3 Next time I see her I want to hide my jealous feeling, but not sure if I can do it well. great. I am good. EOS 6 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so, you envy your friend having a good spouse, is that correct? EOS 6 0 5 yes that is correct. EOS 6 1 6 [Question] Are you a female, if I may ask? EOS 6 0 7 yes. EOS 6 1 8 [Question] Do you have a husband or bf? EOS 6 0 9 I could say I am a female that is one of those left out. not currently. I really don' t know how those women find partners and get married and stay with the same partner for a long time. EOS 6 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You get frustrated that other people are achieving something, you are not able to do. Is that a fair understanding? EOS 6 0 11 I think so, I am not complaining but I guess I am haha. EOS 6 1 12 [Question] What do you think about your self as person? Kid, affectionate, caring?* kind. EOS 6 0 13 I am very sexy and fun but not relaxed, I am caring I think but am not good at showing it. blush! EOS 6 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] To be honest, here what I feel about you.. you have a lots of good qualities, you are a wonderful person. However, you shortchange yourself. If you can, please start building some self confidence.. Be proud of yourself.. Someone having a good hubby does not mean that she is happier than you. EOS 6 0 15 true true. EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One secret in life is if you wish other people be happy from your heart, in turn it makes you happy. Give it a try, and you will realize it. EOS 6 0 17 Oh really! I will definitely try that. Great advice. Thank you. I hope you have a good Xmas. I wish your happiness over Chrismas!:) EOS 6 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] We see so many picture perfect couples in celebrity world... some of them fall apart quickly.. we need to focus on our lives and pursue our happiness... Happy Holidays...
4 0 0 hi. hello!!??!!?? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] hello. EOS 4 0 2 hi. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I apologize I was having a sneezing fit! What is on your mind today?

EOS 4 0 6 i hear ya. just bought some claritin this morning for allergies. I agree. at least she is responding to the treatments in the hospital. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That' s great to hear she is responding! EOS 4 0 8 I was happy to hear it too. I' ve been extra careful not to get it cuz of my parents. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] ah, are they elderly or have a weakened immune system? EOS 4 0 10 elderly. dads doctor told me not to meet friends in person cuz i could pass it onto him. EOS 4 1 11 [Others] gotcha. you must live with them to help them out! EOS 4 0 12 i sure do. thing is people my age are getting very sick with it too. and some elderly are not. so i could be helping myself more than my dad. EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] mine are in another state so i don' t have to worry about my behavior. you are right though, anyone can get it... i should probably be more careful myself. EOS 4 0 14 yes absolutely. never know. its a weird virus. best to keep immune system high which i have been. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] i have increased my vitamins i admit. have you as well? EOS 4 0 16 yes and started taking airborne for vitamin c. EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s great! EOS 4 0 18 Thank ya. I worry about my other relatives out of state. EOS 4 1 19 [Others] i am hoping it all ends soon... i miss how things used to be. EOS 4 0 20 me too. i feel like im living in a bubble lol. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i think we all worry about outofstate relatives. mine are all out of state... the holidays will be hard. lol living in a bubble wrap bubble!
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why? EOS 4 0 8 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID - 19 lockdowns. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] How long have you been working there? EOS 4 0 10 I am very sad about this country and my work situation. For 5 years. I work in accounting. EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID - 19 really has got us all down. EOS 4 0 12 What a great nation we live in..... a future 3rd world one. Yeah, but I was a good accountant. EOS 4 1 13 [Others] WOW, I' m sure that is a big change for you... EOS 4 0 14 Yeah, I have not told my wife about it just yet. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] I agree, this country has got some issues but we can get through them. Uh, oh, how do you think she will react? EOS 4 0 16 Yeah, I am not sure. I better wait to break the news in 2021. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there. EOS 4 0 18 And I am not the only one who is losing my job. Seems that all of accounting is going to be getting the axe. It makes me sad.... EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year. Do you have a resume? EOS 4 0 20 Plus, I have a 50 dollar a day spending habit on lottery tickets to one day hit it BIG. Yes, I have a resume that I have not updated just yet. I have a college education and a CPA to boot, but I need one lucky break in life. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes that will help to get a better perspective on things... taking some time away from everything in order to catch a breath. EOS 4 0 22 Maybe I can spend some quality time with my kids without them knowing I will be out of a job as of 01/ 15/ 2021. It is almost Christmas, too. EOS 4 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I hear ya, I feel like that quite a bit. Like if isn' t one thing it' s another. I' m sure your wife will understand how the economy has gotten and that she knows that it isn' t your fault. EOS 4 0 24 Maybe, but we have a huge mortgage and two BMW' s. We spend lavishly.... Plus, I spend 50 dollars a day on lotto. EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times, but remember all the good times you have had. Those would not be good times if it were' nt for tough times. EOS 4 0 26 True, but the Office was my home away from home. I need to figure out how to deal with my sadness..... EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times. Do you have any hobbies? EOS 4 0 28 Yeah, that is a good point. Should I change careers? I like to walk and do pushups on a regular basis; does that count?? EOS 4 1 29 [Others] I don' t think a huge change like that is neccessary, maybe just looking into options. Unemployment and government help until something else comes up. That is an excellent way to help relieve some stress from our daily lives.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! How are you doing? EOS 0 0 1 im ok kinda stressed. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Anything I can help with:)? Feeling stressed is never fun:( What has been making you feel stressed? EOS 0 0 3 im feeling very overwhelmed and cant get anything done cause i dont know where to start! i want to declutter my house but dont know where to start. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I hear you, feeling overwhelmed and like you don' t know where to start can leave a person feeling stressd forsure! Decluttering sounds like a great idea! Sometimes taking baby steps is a good place to start! EOS 0 0 5 but there are so many thinggs to do and ideas i have. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Of course! It can feel so stressful when we have all these little things we want to do but don' t know where to start!
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi like I said a bit down. EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I did not see that, I am sorry. Do you want to talk about it? It might help. EOS 4 0 3 Ohh thank you for the offer. Proscanation is my thing i guess, and this days I am paying for it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Is it affecting your work or your home life? EOS 4 0 5 Yes it affects everything. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Can you give me an example of something that has been affected recently? For instance, I had been putting off cleaning my house and then some friends dropped by without warning and I was mortified. EOS 4 0 7 I didn' t meet deadline a year back, and lost my job. Now I couldn' t even pay rents. Living with a sibling. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That sounds bad. Have you considered you might be suffering from depression? EOS 4 0 9 Probably. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You sound quite lethargic. I think you should see a GP? EOS 4 0 11 Thank you. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you feel as though life is hopeless and there is no way forward? EOS 4 0 13 No no no... me the super optimist. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] Well that is something:) What are you looking forward to? EOS 4 0 15 Will achieve my goals with proscanation or not. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] What sort of goals have you set for yourself? EOS 4 0 17 I have pills of written works, short stories, poetry novels and a few paintings, but not published yet. I might do that. EOS 4 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well that sounds very creative! You should definitely publish. EOS 4 0 19 There is always" next year" so I am waiting for it... EOS 4 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No no do it now. You might have written a best seller and not know it.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with this evening?. EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very depressed lately. Like a constant pressure that i don' t know exactly what it is. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I' m very sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 4 0 3 I think the days getting shorter makes it worse. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating. EOS 4 0 5 Do you have any tips on how to overcome it? EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help. I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through Instagram. I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while.. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up. I like to stay up, but when it' s time to get up i dread it. Bad cycle. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sure, that' s understandable. There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin D, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them.. EOS 4 0 9 Time is the fire in which we burn. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] Now that is intractable. EOS 4 0 11 Lol... yes it is. The pandemic heightens all our awareness of time and mortality. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes, to me, the enormity of the universe is calming to my anxiety. Being assured that I mean absolutely nothing is nice sometimes. EOS 4 0 13 And drives the civil unrest which makes me feel anxious and insecure. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] Not in a scary, better - off - dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion. I' m a flea to the universe. EOS 4 0 15 Yes i find that a strangly comforting thought. EOS 4 1 16 [Others] ... then you have to wonder, what are fleas thinking?!.
0 0 0 hi there. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m surviving. Today is better than yesterday was. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. What is bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I' ve been out of work since Covid closed down the live event industry in March. the unemployment system still hasn' t processed any of my claims, and I have been surviving off of what I can make driving for doordash, which hasn' t been a lot. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough. The unemployment system has been very slow during COVID, so I completely understand your frustration and worry. I am glad to hear that you are doing door dash, even if you aren' t making a lot that is still something! EOS 0 0 6 ugh, yeah... I drive a really old beat up car though, so I can' t really go out after dark, and I' m worried I' m driving it too much and it' s going to break down. I wish mturk paid more, or one of the jobs I' ve applied for would hire me to do something form home. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I also wish mturk paid more, I feel like it takes a lot of time for not that much money. Do you have a roommate, friend, or family member' s car you could possibly borrow instead of using your own?
3 0 0 Hello, I' ve been really depressed lately and feel like there isn' t anything I can do to break this feeling. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened? EOS 3 0 2 November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS( its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 4 Yes that is correct. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest. EOS 3 0 6 I know I' m not alone and that' s what makes it hard to reach out, because I don' t want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there' s. It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do. It seems that you don' t want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person. EOS 3 0 8 I just don' t know what to do about it anymore. Yes, I don' t like to bother others or let other people down. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure. Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief? Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think? EOS 3 0 10 It is a lot, I' m used to being the person that everyone comes to for help, but I am not very good at asking for help myself. I have seen a doctor and they started my new medicine regimen but unfortunately there is no cure for this disease. I was going to physical therapy but finished that right as Covid started.. Plus it does get better as the weather gets warmer so the winter has been hard, really looking forward to spring and summer for a little relief. EOS 3 1 11 [Others] I' m sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now. EOS 3 0 12 I' d be open to doing Yoga once things open back up, but having this disease puts me in a high risk category so my interaction outside the home still has to remain limited until we develop some heard immunity. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know. Sunshine is always best cure for a better mood. Did you try to maybe walk or drive around your neighborhood for some fresh air? Oh, then drive around might be the only option. EOS 3 0 14 I' m hoping to get out and go for walks once the weather warms up, unfortunately right now there is still some snow on the ground and it' s not quite warn yet being in the northeast. EOS 3 1 15 [Others] Ye. You did the right choice. Safety is always the first concern. EOS 3 0 16 I did take walks along the path in our development last summer so the cabin fever wasn' t as bad as it seems to be with all the snow that basically kept me inside all of february. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Does where you live have a online social activity group on FB or an app called Neighbors? That could be a good way to communicate with others in a safe way.
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Somewhat stressed but otherwise ok. How about you? EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I am great, it snowed and looks like Christmas here. Why are you so stressed?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 0 0 1 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am doing great, how about you? EOS 0 0 3 I am doing good. Can I talk to you about something? EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course you can, tell me about it:) EOS 0 0 5 I am worried that I won' t be able to complete my degree. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Why so? EOS 0 0 7 I can' t get motivated, it doesn' t seem worth it. EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Hey I' ve been there too, but it really helped me meditating and going out with nature to clear my mind of things. You should try it! EOS 0 0 9 What do you meditate about? EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Nothing special, just sit in my room in silence. Listen to tutorials on youtube to meditate. They get me relaxed and motivated for the day:) EOS 0 0 11 I feel like I would sit there and worry about things I have not done yet. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s part of meditation! I too worry while meditating, but when i' m listening to the videos and following instructions all those worries go away:) If that doesn' t help you, you can go out in nature to clear your mind off things. Being in the wild really motivates me to continue.
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. EOS 6 0 1 hello. how are you? I wanted to briefly chat about my jealous feeling. My friend sent me a pic as a greeting showing her hubby and I am jealous. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] I am doing good. How are you? EOS 6 0 3 Next time I see her I want to hide my jealous feeling, but not sure if I can do it well. great. I am good. EOS 6 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so, you envy your friend having a good spouse, is that correct? EOS 6 0 5 yes that is correct. EOS 6 1 6 [Question] Are you a female, if I may ask? EOS 6 0 7 yes. EOS 6 1 8 [Question] Do you have a husband or bf? EOS 6 0 9 I could say I am a female that is one of those left out. not currently. I really don' t know how those women find partners and get married and stay with the same partner for a long time. EOS 6 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You get frustrated that other people are achieving something, you are not able to do. Is that a fair understanding? EOS 6 0 11 I think so, I am not complaining but I guess I am haha. EOS 6 1 12 [Question] What do you think about your self as person? Kid, affectionate, caring?* kind. EOS 6 0 13 I am very sexy and fun but not relaxed, I am caring I think but am not good at showing it. blush! EOS 6 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] To be honest, here what I feel about you.. you have a lots of good qualities, you are a wonderful person. However, you shortchange yourself. If you can, please start building some self confidence.. Be proud of yourself.. Someone having a good hubby does not mean that she is happier than you. EOS 6 0 15 true true. EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One secret in life is if you wish other people be happy from your heart, in turn it makes you happy. Give it a try, and you will realize it.
4 0 0 I feel sad, and feel like need help. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you identify why you feel sad? EOS 4 0 2 yes, my aunt pass away a couple weeks ago. and since then im feeling really sad. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is natural to feel sad when someone you care about dies. EOS 4 0 4 IS there something I can do to feel better? EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are you with family? Sometimes it helps to be with others who are grieving?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability. EOS 3 0 21 i applied for disability but didn' t get it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself. EOS 3 0 23 yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn' t matter. EOS 3 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Social Security stopped you. Why? EOS 3 0 25 i' m not injured enough for them. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can file against the company if you can prove neglect in the employer.. Were there proper safety guards. EOS 3 0 27 I tried but since it is the state of PA they have immunity. no. EOS 3 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was a state injury, there must be an avenue you can use to prove neglect. EOS 3 0 29 I was told that I assumed the risk of injury working for them. It was a mental hospital. EOS 3 1 30 [Question] have you contacted OSHA and filed a complaint with them? EOS 3 0 31 not yet. I should. EOS 3 1 32 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There should be an avenue for you to seek compensation. EOS 3 0 33 The lawyer fought with them for over a year. There was even an appeal but I lost that too. EOS 3 1 34 [Reflection of feelings] It is unfortunate that safety is not a factor. It was a state hospital? EOS 3 0 35 yes. EOS 3 1 36 [Question] Did a patient attack you? EOS 3 0 37 yes. EOS 3 1 38 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There must be liability concerning your injury. EOS 3 0 39 I can' t go after the patient because they are mentally incompetent so I' m out of ideas. EOS 3 1 40 [Question] But what about the family? EOS 3 0 41 I don' t know if the person had one anymore. EOS 3 1 42 [Question] Is the patient a ward of the state. EOS 3 0 43 yes. EOS 3 1 44 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So the patient' s family either gave the person up or the patient was placed there by the state right? EOS 3 0 45 he was placed there by the court after committing a crime. EOS 3 1 46 [Affirmation and Reassurance] . Then he must be a threat to other people. It seems the state should be held liable for negligence.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially?
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 6 0 1 hi. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing? EOS 6 0 3 Well I' m distraught. EOS 6 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel that way?
3 0 0 Hello, I need some help with this. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I' m here to help you.
0 0 0 Good afternoon. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Good afternoon. how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I am not good at all. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] oh no. I am sorry, what happened? EOS 0 0 4 This pandemic is causing too much of trouble for me. Firstly pay cut and now about to layoff. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. This pandemic terrible. sorry to hear that. EOS 0 0 6 My company don' t want to consider any body at all. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s pretty tough. You' re like the 3rd person today who have been going through this, EOS 0 0 8 And I don' t know what to do. EOS 0 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Can they work with another company to secure you a job or can you come back to work later if you get lay off? EOS 0 0 10 I don' t even know what they will decide. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Can you talk to your boss possibly and let him know you could do other job to help your boss so that you won' t get laid off? EOS 0 0 12 This is not affecting only one person it is affecting every body in the company. Nobody know who is next. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see. If it is really likely to happen, I would brush up my resume, make it stand out, but job search can be really stressful.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello how are you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I am good, how are you?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Much better than normal, even though the stock market is down. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Are you an investor? EOS 0 0 3 I am a student that tries to put as much money into as possible. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand the struggle with being at that stage in life. Has this affected you negatively? EOS 0 0 5 No the stock market really doesn' t cause stress for me, mostly just small things that I think my brain overreacts to. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] What sorts of things? EOS 0 0 7 Kind of a variety of things. I typically get bad anxiety after a night of going out. So I am trying to cut out drinking. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety? Do you suffer from anxiety when you do not drink ever? EOS 0 0 9 Sometimes but I think the root from them comes from when I do something while I' m drinking. Not that I do anything bad, but I just don' t like not remembering things. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] So you would say that you drink to the point of blacking out? Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you' ve had a reasonable amount of alcohol? EOS 0 0 11 I used to black out a lot, but I have tried to control it by cutting the former amount of drinks I consumed in half, if I do choose to go out. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I have drank to the point of blacking out several times in my life mostly when I was younger and I found that it either came from a certain type of alcohol or mixing different types. Have you noticed it could be related to that or simply the amount of alcohol you are drinking?.

1 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How may I help you today? EOS 1 0 1 hi. I am stressed with my 25 year old moved back from NYC.. My boyfriend and I have a home and my son does not like him. EOS 1 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that i can understand how you must be feeling. Why does your son not like your boyfriend? EOS 1 0 3 He is going back to school and I am supporting him in that. The problem is that my boyfriend thinks my son should speak to me more respectfully. He gets upset when my son is swears and shows anger to me. EOS 1 1 4 [Question] Have you talked to your boyfriend about how you are feeling? EOS 1 0 5 He knows that I am torn. I am not going to put my son out of the house. I am also not one to get loud and angry. My son verbally is aggressive. EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand why your boyfriend be getting upset if your son is disrespectful to you and is aggressive but you know that is your son and you going to be there for him no matter what. EOS 1 0 7 Yes, and I have gotten my son to go to a therapist weekly to try to express his anger about the pandemic and the changes it has brought in his lifestyle. He cannot take his frustrustations out on us. EOS 1 1 8 [Question] How long has this been going on? Is the therapist working for him?
1 0 0 Hello I am having pro\ blems with a friend. EOS 1 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so so sorry to hear that. What has been going on? EOS 1 0 2 Sometimes she is very friendly, but sometimes she is super rude. In a way that is so rude that it has never happened before by someone who I consider a friend. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh wow, it sounds like shes not a very good frined. EOS 1 0 4 As nice as she is, every once in a while show will be equally nasty. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Have you tried talking to her about it? EOS 1 0 6 Super snarky comments. Yes I have tried. But it still continues. EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried seperating from her? EOS 1 0 8 I can' t she is a colleague. So unless I want to get a new job. but she is super helpful and nice 99 percent of the time. And when I have spoken with her, the last time I was very clear with her that it was inappropriate, and it hasn' t been happening as often, but the whole situation is still very hurtful. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s so hurtful. Do others feel the same as you? EOS 1 0 10 Yes, I have heard these complaints from one other person. Do you have any ideas or other suggestions for me. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you can try talking to yoru manager next time it happens? It is hard but you can only really control yourself, so you need to try to emotionally distance yourself from when she is terrible. You seem like a good persn. EOS 1 0 12 That is a good idea to talk to a manager. but there is no avoiding working with her because of the nature of my job. but that is an option that I didn' t considerr before so thatnk you for your insight. Thank you that is very nice. Let me know if you have any other ideas as well. EOS 1 1 13 [Self-disclosure] Of course!! managers are erally helpful. I had a similar sitation with a coworker two years ago and the head of my group really helped me clear it up. EOS 1 0 14 Did you try other things as well. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I tried really hard not to let her get to me. Which was really hard but doable. EOS 1 0 16 Oh that is good, sometimes when a person sees that they are not getting under your skin they give up on pushing your buttons, was that what happened in your case. EOS 1 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Exactly!!!! EOS 1 0 18 How long did it take from starting to ending. the issues. EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] a few months.
1 0 0 I' m having issues with my parents. You can say we are having a conflict. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] What kind of issues do you think you are having? EOS 1 0 2 well they won' t allow me to date this girl i met online.. They told she' s bad news. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today. Have you tried talking to you parents about why she is" bad news"? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, i tried but it won' t get through their head. There are so old school. They want me to date someone close to my age. is 15 year difference too big of a gap? EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] The basic problem is that your parents believe that 15 years is too large of an age gap between you guys. Is there any other reasons your parents dissaporve of her? EOS 1 0 6 They told me she' s gold digger. Yes i come from money but hey this girl is the one.. EOS 1 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You believe that the girl is not a gold digger, but instead you guys like each other for who you are. Money is not an issue for you guys? EOS 1 0 8 nope not at all. hmm well she does ask to use my credit card alot. my parents foot the bill.. EOS 1 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps you should try to talk to your parents around this fact. For example, if money is the problem for your parents, you can set some rules. LIke you can set an allowance for how much money you can use each week.
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, what brings you to bring the seeker? EOS 6 0 1 I feel upset with myself over my situation. Did you read it? EOS 6 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I did not see it. What is your situation? I am here to listen. EOS 6 0 3 I feel ashamed of my depression symptoms. I feel other people are ashamed of me. EOS 6 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how? EOS 6 0 5 I just can' t live reguarly life like" healthy" people do and they notice my symptoms. They don' t understand how your mind can be your enemy. EOS 6 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are saying that you can' t live regularly and people don' t understand that your mind isn' t working in your favor. Is that right? Can you tell me what you mean by your mind being your enemy? EOS 6 0 7 Like I have no interest or motivation to do ANYTHING some days. Hard to even take care of my hygiene. My mind doesn' t care to do it even when it' s embarrasing for people to notice. EOS 6 1 8 [Greeting] That sounds very hard. I can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn' t want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself. What do you do to cope? EOS 6 0 9 stay away from mean people, stop tryiig to explain my symptoms to others who won' t get it. EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That makes sense why you would want to avoid doing these things, which is a good thing, but is there anything that you try to do that isn' t avoidance? Something that approaches something? EOS 6 0 11 I go to all my therapy appoints and try to participate. Thanks for your help. Have a good day. EOS 6 1 12 [Question] How do you feel about therapy? EOS 6 0 13 I have to go now. Bye. EOS 6 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is unfortunate, but I understand. We haven' t finished, the task, however, but I hope you feel better.
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic? EOS 0 0 16 so literally, I only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. I only started a new work in September, and it' s not much( about two days a week), so I can' t comment too much about that. It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps. EOS 0 0 18 so I get nervous in general when I am at work but I do my work just the same. May not be able to work as well because I have to breathe through a mask, and some other small difficulties. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is good that you can continue to do your work the same.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello, I am looking for help in managing some depression. EOS 3 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You' ve come to a good place to start. Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 3 I am feeling resentful towards my husband for quitting his job, and my son for being the reason that he quit his job.. My son' s behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us. EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband' s loss of work and your son' s loss of his job is entirely understandable. EOS 3 0 5 I have a hard time not dwelling on the negative things going on. It' s hard to see anything positive or feel hopeful for the future. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and I understand the added stress that can cause in your household. That is a really difficult position to be in. EOS 3 0 7 My son is very defiant and argues with us about everything we try and get him to do, but he expects us to give him money for fun things that he wants to do when he isn' t willing to work or even help out around the house. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Regardless of what your husband' s actions are and your son' s, could you possibly make the time to do things to support yourself, that even momentarily would provide you with some positive feelings?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there! What would you like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 1 I am trying to be fine and you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] It may be helpful to know.. my name is Ann. I am 43 years old... and I know for myself, I enjoy talking to people when I have concerns. What is going on? EOS 0 0 3 Thank you for your concern, I am just worried.

In your relationship, what has happened to create your worries? EOS 0 0 7 I trusted my spouse but eventually disappointed. She got a jot in another town and she utilize the opportunity to be sleeping around. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine how a break in trust has made you feel. I know a break in trust is always very difficult to process. EOS 0 0 9 I am planing to get married next year but things has changed now. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Oh I am sorry to hear that. Have you had a conversation with her about her actions and how they have made you feel? EOS 0 0 11 She knew pretty well how I felt. I don' t want to have anything to do with her again. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel that her actions and result can be remedied? Or is this such a fundamental break that you cannot reconcile? EOS 0 0 13 I just want to move on with my life. EOS 0 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Understandable. I would feel similar, in truth. EOS 0 0 15 I don' t that I can love her again. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Only you know whether or not if you can look to forgiving and moving forward or if this is such a fundamental break that it is not something you can mend. And if you know that this is not something you wish to move forward with her that doesn’t make you a bad person. It means you are taking care of yourself first.

4 0 0 I just lost my job and am worried about paying the bills. EOS 4 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills. EOS 4 0 2 There is just too much pressure, but I have to succeed. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is hard having so much pressure but I think you will be able to soon get employed again.
4 1 0 [Question] Hey there, what' s going on today? EOS 4 0 1 Hello. It is a fine day, how about yourself? EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] It really is! I am just taking in the fresh air in the backyard.

EOS 4 1 1 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before. EOS 4 0 2 its so annoying and hurtful. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Yeah i can tell you something you might not want to hear but it ended with us ending our friendship on that level. EOS 4 0 4 i definitely do not want to end our friendship, that would be even more painful. EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years. We still hang out but it isnt like it was before. People move on to others and it hurts. They usually are not trying to hurt us though. EOS 4 0 6 I know, but its hard when you are the one still stuck, Im not ready for change. EOS 4 1 7 [Others] Yea it was hard for me too. Thats the thing about change it just happens. I would do something focusing on yourself. Trying to make yourself feel better. EOS 4 0 8 i could try to focus on myself. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everyone needs to and everyone forgets too heh. EOS 4 0 10 I agree, i need to focus more on myself. EOS 4 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Good, im glad you can realize that! Some people cant. EOS 4 0 12 its hard to but I know that its time to focus on me more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Great, any ideas on what you would like to focus on? EOS 4 0 14 focus on me, doing things by myself instead of with my friend. going to eat, spa time, me time, only with me. then allow myself to make new friends. do you have any suggestions that i can focus on. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Those are great ideas actually, When i want some me time, i usually go for a nice long hike or run. EOS 4 0 16 i thinks hikes and runs are good too, they actually are peaceful and makes me focus on life. EOS 4 1 17 [Others] Yeah, it helps i think even down to a chemical level. Kinda like a great reset for our minds.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you. EOS 3 0 1 Not doing well. I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Oh no, how long had you been together? EOS 3 0 3 we were together for 2 years. It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Wow, that' s horrible. How do you feel about it? EOS 3 0 5 I feel lost. I' m so used to her being around everyday. Now I don' t know what to do with myself without her. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year. EOS 3 0 7 Not only that, but with Covid going on I have noone i can see to talk about it. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have any family? EOS 3 0 9 Yes, i do, but they are far away. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Friends closeby? Hobbies? What kind of work do you do? EOS 3 0 11 I do have friends, who are also friends with her. However they have families and do not visit prople because of covid. I don' t have any true hobbies. I don' t think they will fill the void anyways. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow. EOS 3 0 13 I do software development, but its a work at home situation. So i have been just by myself for the last week, and its driving me crazy. All i do is think about why she would do that. I' ve had time to myself but its not getting any better. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have always tried to think of things in a positive way. This way even when something really bad happens, it doesn' t seem so bad as to overwhelm us from recovering. EOS 3 0 15 What positive are there here? EOS 3 1 16 [Question] I' m actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it? Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren' t hurting for money. EOS 3 0 17 It' s ok. pays the bills. But my job is pretty independent. so i don' t even get to meet new people. I am usually home, while she was always out of the house during the day. EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can use that stress that has been building up to find a new outlet for the stress. EOS 3 0 19 what, you want to break stuff to relieve stress. EOS 3 1 20 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. My wife used to think I was just playing on the computer all day, lol. I run. Every morning, I jog about 2 miles. It is awesome to get the blood going and a great way to start the day.
3 0 0 I' m so depressed, I just got layed off. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I am sorry to hear that, did you apply for unemployment benefit? That at least can help you financially until you get a new job. EOS 3 0 2 Yes, it will take weeks and the holidays are just around the corner. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sucks it happens so close to the holidays. I understand it' s hard to accept but I' d recommend talking with someone close to you like a friend and family member. EOS 3 0 4 I know, with all the other crap going on now everyone else has their own problems they don' t want to hear mine. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure someone will be there for you, they know you need them the most right now. If you don' t feel comfortable talking to them, you can seek online therapist. There are a lot of free service for mental car. EOS 3 0 6 They' re busy with other people' s problems. I' ll deal with it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It' s not gonna be easy, but at the same time not impossible. Try looking at it a different way. You can use this time to train your skills or do things that you' ve wanted to but didn' t have the time. EOS 3 0 8 I wanted to travel but that' s not a good idea right now. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] You can still travel domestically or just around your city. I like taking a walk in the park or wandering downtown to clear my mind. EOS 3 0 10 I live in a small town and were are suppose to self quarantine unless we have to leave the house for work or go to the store. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] that really sucks. Do you have a garden at home? In the mean time, try following youtube or other channels to work out, it helps you distract from current issue and also makes you healthier. A healthy body is needed for a healthy mind. EOS 3 0 12 I did, everything is gone now.. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] what have you been doing lately?
2 0 0 hi. EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hey! How are you?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there.
0 0 0 Hello my situation is that I' m facing an enormous amount of academic pressure. EOS 0 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello. Academic work can be overwhelming at times. I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though. Could you tell me what the issue is in particular? EOS 0 0 2 It' s just a huge amount of work that I' m struggling with and a ton of exams and they give me a lot of anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming. Make sure that you try to be as prepared as you can. When you feel capable of doing well on said exams, you will feel a lot less pressure. EOS 0 0 4 Do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though? EOS 0 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have an academic councelor you can talk to? EOS 0 0 6 yes it' s all virtual though. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well at least is something. I am sure talking to someone who might be able to guide you academically will be a significant relief.. EOS 0 0 8 That is a good idea. Do you personally recommend anything on how to balance my schedule and still be able to have my time to do other things? EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] When I was at college, I usually aimed at 2 hours of studying everyday(+ homework) and I also aimed to have at least 2 hours of leisure time. EOS 0 0 10 I see, and how were you able to maintain a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep and healthy eating habits during college? EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I honestly didn' t eat very healthy. If you live with your parents, I think a proper nutrition is easier. I usually slept around 7 hours each night. I picked most of my classes on the afternoon, worked out in the mornings.
2 0 0 Good afternoon/ evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you tonight? EOS 2 0 2 Doing great. How about yourself? EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I' m doing well how can I help you tonight? EOS 2 0 4 So, the issue I' m having is work - related. My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He' s also in the middle of testing for CP. My job requires that I be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask... but sometimes the people I am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6 - foot boundary. A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills. My son just turned 2. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you' d wish they wear a mask? EOS 2 0 6 I have. A few people respected my wishes. But one in particular stands out. A gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. He got angry at my request. In my shoes, what would you do? Because I feel like Im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol. EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don' t honor your requests? EOS 2 0 8 It makes me feel trapped. Frustrated. I would never intentionally try to put someone else in harms way and I feel like I don t.* don' t get the same courtesy. I feel frustrated because I' m REQUIRED to deal with people. I work in construction. I feel trapped because, what are my options? Continue to work..... my son gets sick and dies. His pediatrician has already warned me how deadly this could be for me. And if I quit? No money? I have a 5 year old I have to take care of too.. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before I share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue?
0 0 0 Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, what seems to be on your mind?. EOS 0 0 2 Friends and our relationships amongst one another. Two are arguing and I want to help both. We only can facetime each other because of Corona and it is taking a toll among our group. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I see. How long have your two friends been arguing? EOS 0 0 4 It has been around 4 months now. It started slowly and now has ramped up to where it' s exploding and causing discourse among us all. One of my friends told a secret to another acquaintance outside of our group. My friend is raging over this which she should. trust was broken. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like tempers are all running pretty hot for everyone right now, is that correct? EOS 0 0 6 I believe in forgiveness, and the friend that told is very remorseful How do I help them? EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Well, it sounds like you are in a tough spot since both your friends are so mad at each other.. Why do you think your one friends shared a secret they were supposed to keep? EOS 0 0 8 The acquaintance knew something of the secret because she had experienced this before. I think my friend was more - so trying to help my other friend, not betray her. She went outside the group but not for spitrful reasons i think. EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I think I understand. Sometimes we accidentally hurt the people we love when we are trying to help. EOS 0 0 10 I want one friend to know that the other was trying to hel and nothurt, but did not think clearly when deciding where to get help from. How do I make her understand this? EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it is great that you want to actively help, it says a lot about you. EOS 0 0 12 Thanks! What should I say to her? EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes the best way to help someone understand is to give them a little time and space. Trying to force someone to understand doesn' t always work.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you today? EOS 3 0 1 hi i am okay, a little bit sad though. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Okay. I am very sorry to hear that! Do you want to tell me more about that? EOS 3 0 3 Well with the holidays coming up i have been very stressed and nervous about what i am going to do. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really feel you there. Holidays are so hard.. especially with the way this year has been. Anything specific?. EOS 3 0 5 Yes. I am a college student and I live on campus. The day before I moved in my dad said some unforgivable things to me and we haven' t spoke since. I have no choice but to go live at home over the break but I am very scared about it. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Do you feel scared for your own self? Or of the situation in general? I' m sorry to hear that. Relationships with parents can be very difficult sometimes.. I' m around college age as well and also live at home. So I can understand your struggle. EOS 3 0 7 more for the situation in general. i know we will not speak but we will constantly be running into each other, my house is not big. and i have no car to escape it. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] It' s like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it' s such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you' re not positive in. I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely.. It' ll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets? EOS 3 0 9 Thank you I appreciate that. I will be fine making it over the thanksgiving break but I am more nervous about covid - 19 sending us home for good.. Not many to be honest. I have a hamster but he is at school with me so nothing at home to go back to. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like Covid - 19 is going to be a personal stressor for you. It' s such a strange thing to have to live with already, the pandemic, and i' m sorry that it might end up pushing you where you don' t want to be. Could you bring your hamster home with you? Even the smallest things could help a place feel more loving. EOS 3 0 11 Yes it is very strange and I know that it is a big stressor on all of us, i don' t want to sound selfish.. Yes i am bringing him home with me so that is my little piece of joy that is coming along. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t think you' re selfish at all. You have feelings you are entitled to have and are expressing them which is healthy and I encourage that behavior! Good! I know how hard this situation can be. Very nerve wracking. The smallest things, even a hamster, can be so beneficial. EOS 3 0 13 Well thank you that does help me to feel better. Yes I am happy to bring him home with me and hoping I can have my niece over to intro duce her to him. EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] You sound like a very determined person in making this trip as stress free as possible. I commend you for that! Maybe you could have your niece over often to play with your hamster just to soften the stress of being there. EOS 3 0 15 It is surely my goal! I appreciate your kind words. I would love that if I had a car I could do that but I am not sure how much she will be able to come to my house. I am going to try though! EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is Uber an option for you? I know there' s a lot of rideshare services but they' re not always financially reasonable. But that could be a way to get away if you ever need too! EOS 3 0 17 that is very true i didn' t even think of that to be honest! I may use that along the way, thank you for the reminder! EOS 3 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes I forget little things like that to help myself whenever I get too involved in the emotional aspect of things. I' m glad I could suggest it to you!.
3 0 0 hello. how are you today? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today?. EOS 3 0 2 a bit sad. more depressed. its just i keep getting benched at work. i' m not really sure what do to.* to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset. EOS 3 0 4 i' m not really sure what i' m doing wrong. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though. EOS 3 0 6 what can i do though? EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there' s anything going on? EOS 3 0 8 hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Of course! That sounds frustrating to not know why it' s happening and not have the opportunity to ask. EOS 3 0 10 yes... hrm. that may work. how can i stop being depressed all the time though.. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' ve also had bosses that are infrequently in the office and make getting good information hard.
4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 tired. and u? EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like an exhausting time for a lot of people right now. I' m also a bit tired but doing OK. What' s been on your mind recently? EOS 4 0 3 just trying to finish this semester. EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like a stressful time to be in college. How have you been coping with everything going on? EOS 4 0 5 listening to music. EOS 4 1 6 [Others] Nice! What kind of music do you like? EOS 4 0 7 mainly hip hop and r& b but I dabble in some alternative, hyperpop, and edm. EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I also like hip hop and r& b. It' s too bad we aren' t able to go to any live music events for a while, though. EOS 4 0 9 yea. have u done any of the virtual concerts? EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I' ve seen them advertised but I haven' t tried any of them yet. I think I saw there was a Lil Nas X one coming up though, might check that out. Have you done any?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 3 0 2 well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. My life is done now. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband. EOS 3 0 4 well, I cannot say it is a new start when I will be 90 in March. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Then you' ve definitely got a lot going for you if you' re 90! EOS 3 0 6 Had. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Why did he leave you? EOS 3 0 8 He wanted a younger woman. His new girlfriend is 63. He is 45. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that is more of his problem then. You deserve someone that' s better than leaving someone because of their age. EOS 3 0 10 I thought it would be nice to have a younger man when we got married. He eventually told me he just married me for my money, and was waiting for me to pass so he could inherit all of it. He said he got tired of waiting, so he moved on to someone else. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Personally, if that' s how he felt, then you' re better off. I know that doesn' t stop the hurt you' re feeling, but you are worth more than that. EOS 3 0 12 Now I am here alone. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being single does not mean you' re completely alone. There are a lot of resources to talk to someone and make friends. EOS 3 0 14 I am looking on Tinder for a new friend, but nobody wants someone that is 90. I never used it before, but someone told me about it. Considering I haven' t dated in 25 years. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could you try something like Facebook or Instagram to connect with old friends or acquaintances? EOS 3 0 16 What are those? I heard of them, but never used them. Most of my old friends are no longer around... EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Social networks online, you can connect with family or old coworkers. And post pictures and see what other people are doing with their lives. EOS 3 0 18 I am looking for something quicker, I don' t know how much longer I have. I can' t be spending months waiting for the right person. EOS 3 1 19 [Question] So you' re looking for a strictly romantic relationship?
0 0 0 I am really feeling the loneliness of the season and being isolated. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Good evening. EOS 0 0 2 Good evening. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just so I understand, the holiday season is making you feel alone and isolated. EOS 0 0 4 Yes as well as the virus. Are we out of time. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Is there anything in particular about the holidays that is bothering you? EOS 0 0 6 Just no family around. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I am also far away from my family for the holidays, so I know how hard that is. EOS 0 0 8 The virus this year does not help. EOS 0 1 9 [Others] Not at all. EOS 0 0 10 ARe you affected by the virus. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about setting up some video calls with your family during the holidays? I know a lot of people are doing that so they can feel closer to the family during these tough times/ I have not been able to travel as much due to the virus.

And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct?
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why? EOS 4 0 8 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID - 19 lockdowns. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] How long have you been working there? EOS 4 0 10 I am very sad about this country and my work situation. For 5 years. I work in accounting. EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID - 19 really has got us all down. EOS 4 0 12 What a great nation we live in..... a future 3rd world one. Yeah, but I was a good accountant. EOS 4 1 13 [Others] WOW, I' m sure that is a big change for you... EOS 4 0 14 Yeah, I have not told my wife about it just yet. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] I agree, this country has got some issues but we can get through them. Uh, oh, how do you think she will react?
3 0 0 Hi, how are you today? I feel really sad all the time. I don' t know why. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] hello. you feel sad, why? EOS 3 0 2 I' m not sure. I can' t find a reason. My health is fine. I have friends. I have a place to live. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] your health is fine and you have place to live but you are still sad. EOS 3 0 4 Yes, that' s right. I feel like my life is not going in the right direction. In fact, I' m not going anywhere. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] have you talked to anyone about it. EOS 3 0 6 No, not really. I don' t know what to talk about. I just feel flat. Something' s wrong. I don' t know what. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i have felt that way before but i came over it. EOS 3 0 8 How did you do that? I really need some guidance here. What do I do? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] it came to me like a mood swing for so many days but i started going to meet friends and get closer to my friends for positive vibes.
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you feeling? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay. Thank you. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i' m okay too. EOS 0 0 4 Thats good. Do you have plans for the holidays? EOS 0 1 5 [Others] not really, i will probably just relax. what about you? EOS 0 0 6 Just hanging out at home with my husband and son. EOS 0 1 7 [Others] how' s your relationship with your family? EOS 0 0 8 It is pretty good. We all get along good. No issues. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] glad to hear so! EOS 0 0 10 How is your relationship with your family? EOS 0 1 11 [Others] it' s overly alright but i don' t really get along with my father. EOS 0 0 12 Oh i am sorry to hear that.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] don' t worry, it' s okay i am used to it. EOS 0 0 14 Has the Pandemic affected your work life at all?. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] not really i' ve always worked from home. what about you?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 0 0 2 Just feeling sad. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad? EOS 0 0 4 Not being able to leave the house with Covid. plus my hours were cut at work. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut. What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time? EOS 0 0 6 Yes it sucks. I live alone now so there really hard sometimes. I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos. Nothing productive. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it' s not the same as face to face. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I have one close friend that I talk to every now and then. Its not like it use to be. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That' s still a win. EOS 0 0 10 We used to be able to go out and have a few beers together.. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. Keep that connection. It' s not going to be the same due to the circumstances. But at least you are seeking to keep that connection, and that is a good thing. EOS 0 0 12 I hope that this vaccine thing is reason and we can get back to the norm.. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it' s not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest. EOS 0 0 14 Good idea.. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well. But I am hoping they get it right, and not just rush to get something out there that may or may not work. EOS 0 0 16 I like to do home repairs. Maybe I can find a group for that. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway. EOS 0 0 18 Do you use any other social media for connecting with new people. EOS 0 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I use Facebook, Instagram, and sometimes TikTok. You should do mini videos on easy things to DIY on TikTok. EOS 0 0 20 True. I have to change out a few old style electrical plugs. Maybe I can do something on that? EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] right! That is a great idea! EOS 0 0 22 I saw a few TikTok videos but never post a video. Is it hard to post on there? EOS 0 1 23 [Self-disclosure] not really. what i do is record the video beforehand, and then upload it.
6 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 1 Hi there. Can you help me? EOS 6 1 2 [Question] What help you need? please can you explain.
1 0 0 hi there. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hi! Hope you are doing well. How can I help you today? EOS 1 0 2 I am having such a hard time falling asleep at night.... I toss and turn and cannot shut my mind off. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep. Hope I get it right? EOS 1 0 4 yes that' s right. my mind just races thinking about problems it seems. I am irritable and frustrated. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Is there a specific thing or task which is bothering you for long? EOS 1 0 6 I worry about my daughter, she has addictions. I never know if she is okay or not, she doesn' t call me very often and is hard to get a hold of. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It must be a tough time for you and is a enough reason to not getting good sleep. despite of it you should need a complete rest. EOS 1 0 8 Have you any suggestions to help me get to sleep easier? I have tried meditation, but it doesn' t seem to help much. EOS 1 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I feels like you are having less energy and feel tired due to lack of sleep. Try to follow a particular schedule and u can put soothing music before bed. It might calm you down and make you sleep. EOS 1 0 10 That' s a good idea I can try that. My bedtimes are kind of mixed up, maybe setting a particular schedule will help, I' ll try that. sometimes i go to be early, sometimes late, maybe that is screwing me up. EOS 1 1 11 [Self-disclosure] When I have sleeping problem, I take warm shower. It help me a lot. EOS 1 0 12 good idea, i could try that. EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] As far as I know if we follow a particular time to go to bed eventually We start feeling sleepy at that time or body adapt it. EOS 1 0 14 oh ok, that makes sense. i wish my daughter lived closer so i can check on her, she is in another city which makes it hard. i worry. ok well thankyou for your help. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can understand how hard it is for you. But nothing stays same. I wish your daughter will come out of it soon and wishing her success. Meditation can help you too. Before sleeping you can concentrate on your breath.
4 0 0 Hi. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing these days? EOS 4 0 2 Not good. You? EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry to hear that. I am doing fine and hope I can cheer you up.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there how can be of help? EOS 3 0 2 I am suffering from low mood and general depression. I don' t know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down( obviously) and there doesn' t appear to be any real reason behind it. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue? EOS 3 0 4 I felt this way for a while actually isn' t a recent change it' s been building slowly over time. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same? EOS 3 0 6 I think I know what you mean. It' s getting worse. I feel very down. EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse. EOS 3 0 8 Yeah. I worry that I' ll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. I' m really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Firstly, you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with depression and it' s good that you have reached out for help for this. EOS 3 0 10 Any suggestions on what to do about it? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many reasons people have depression. It is a recognised medical condition and the good news is that there is help out there. The first step is recognising the problem. EOS 3 0 12 Ok well there is definitely a problem. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Have you spoken to friends and family about this? do they know how much you are struggling with it at the moment? EOS 3 0 14 not really I don' t want to bother other people with my problems. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. I think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help. EOS 3 0 16 Yeah maybe. I suppose nobody really understands but I could at least speak to them about it. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] everyone has problems and it is good to talk about them because a problem shared is a problem halved. It doesn' t mean the problems will go away but it might help you understand them and then be able to deal with them better. EOS 3 0 18 I don' t want to feel like this anymore. I' m willing to at least give it a go. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also think that it will be worse to get in touch with your doctor or a medical professional. these people are trained to deal with problems like yours and will be able to offer effective Solutions from a medical perspective. EOS 3 0 20 I haven' t spoken to a doctor about this before to be clear I don' t want any medication. EOS 3 1 21 [Question] are you worried that speaking to a doctor will lead to you being given medication, and you don' t want this?
3 0 0 I' m so depressed, I just got layed off. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I am sorry to hear that, did you apply for unemployment benefit? That at least can help you financially until you get a new job. EOS 3 0 2 Yes, it will take weeks and the holidays are just around the corner. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sucks it happens so close to the holidays. I understand it' s hard to accept but I' d recommend talking with someone close to you like a friend and family member. EOS 3 0 4 I know, with all the other crap going on now everyone else has their own problems they don' t want to hear mine. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure someone will be there for you, they know you need them the most right now. If you don' t feel comfortable talking to them, you can seek online therapist. There are a lot of free service for mental car.
4 0 0 I face the situation of me being sad because I thought we could let this fight go over time but instead it has lead to us breaking up. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about the fight? EOS 4 0 2 Yes, so we had a fight previously over Thanksgiving Break about how I woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. Then I pick her up to go try and get breakfast... then she starts punching me while I drive so I pull over. Then she keeps hitting me until I tell her to stop. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple. Is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else? EOS 4 0 4 It is because I do really miss her. I really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Breakups are hard, but it sounds like she was violent. EOS 4 0 6 Yeah she was a little violent. I was honestly a little scared for my life for a second but people make mistakes. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Have you talked since then? EOS 4 0 8 We have talked a little bit before hand this month. It was okay but I am still sad about what happened. She was very open to talking and such but I just wasn' t ready because my family found out about what happened and are worried about my safety. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If safety is an issue, then I think that maybe moving on is a good decision.
0 1 0 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today? EOS 0 0 1 I am so stressed out because my business has suffered this year. I am very worried I may have to close and I won' t be able to pay my bills. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is really tough. a lot of people are going through that, you are not alone. what kind of business do you have? EOS 0 0 3 I sell cosmetics. I think a lot of people don' t have money to buy non essential items right now. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] christmas is right around the corner though, and it is almost the 15th. military get paid the 1st and 15th so there is still hope for a christmas rush! tax season is right around the corner too... there is defineately still reason to keep hope. EOS 0 0 5 That might be true. I just don' t know that business will ever recover. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you online or in store?
2 1 0 [Question] hi! how are you doing today> EOS 2 0 1 Hello, I' m doing okay, wbu? EOS 2 1 2 [Others] ok it' s been a stressful time for most of us but we are all doing the best we can. EOS 2 0 3 Yeah that' s true. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] whats been the weirdest part of the pandemic for you? EOS 2 0 5 So I live with my boyfriend and my bestfriend. And I am afraid they are doing skethy stuff behind my back. It sounds crazy, and I don' t have any proof but I have this feeling. The way they talk around each other makes me nervous. EOS 2 1 6 [Question] hmm, tell me more. what do you think is going on? EOS 2 0 7 I' m scared when it is just the two of them here at home. And they are jsut so much more friendly together than before we moved in. EOS 2 1 8 [Question] living together can make people more comfortable with each other. has there been something specific that has caused you to wonder about them> EOS 2 0 9 Not really specifics. It' s more of a just in general sort of thing. I know them both really really well, so I am just picking up on tiny little details. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] i hear you. have you said anything to either one of them? EOS 2 0 11 I have talked to my boyfriend, but he just tells me that it' s crazy I would think something like that. Idk... I don' t want to sound crazy and blow it out of proportion if it' s really nothing. I don' t know if there is actually something I should be worried about, or if I am thinking these crazy thoughts for other reasons. EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] having doubts about relationships is rough. do you know brene brown? EOS 2 0 13 I don' t know who that is. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she researches shame and vunerability. EOS 2 0 15 Does she do live talks or videos? Or is she more in online writing. EOS 2 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she has a great TED talk! EOS 2 0 17 Oh that' s cool! I will have to check that out. So you think maybe I am feeling this way is because I have shame or vulnerability in the relationship? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] anyway, i find her imspirational when I have doubts. no, not really it' s the doubting that is likely what' s bothering you the most - the unknown. EOS 2 0 19 Yeah.. that' s true. I think it' s a good idea to learn more about how I' m feeling before I make any rash decisions. EOS 2 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s wise. theres a great youtube video with cartoon animals where brene talks about empathy. EOS 2 0 21 Ohhh wait I think I have seen that one haha. It was shown in my class in like 9th grade. EOS 2 1 22 [Self-disclosure] things are weird for everyone right now. emotions are running high, covid is running rampant, it' s a mess and understandable that we are all stressed. EOS 2 0 23 Yeah you are right. I think I am just overthinking a lot. I will look into that TED talk. Thank you so much for the advice! I appreciate the conversation. EOS 2 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] please stay safe and communicate with your roommates.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how is your day today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. Not so good. I lost my cat recently. It surely feels... overwhelming at times. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] That is a very hard thing to be going through where you very close to your cat? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, I had her for 11 years. She died of natural causes. I lived alone with her. The house feels extremely empty now... EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am very sorry to hear that i have also lost a pet earlier this year his name was fish and was only 3 years old he unfortunately passed due to liver cancer. It was a very trying experience but slowly the pain of his passing has got a little bit easier. Have you tried talking about this loss to friends of family? EOS 3 0 5 No. My family lives in another country, and I really don' t have any close friends. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] What have your feelings been like after the passing of your cat? EOS 3 0 7 I feel hopeless. Alone. I feel like a chunk of myself passed along with her. EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Those are completely valid feelings to have at this time. Have you considered getting a small reminder of your cat perhaps a small shrine or tribute to him/ her? Her I apologize for the confusion. EOS 3 0 9 No. I fear that things like that may remind me of her and make me feel worse. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Expressing your emotion is very healthy for example maybe taking up a new hobby or trying something new that scares or excites you to get your mind off of this difficult time.
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing? EOS 6 0 1 I' m doing okay.. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you want to talk about? EOS 6 0 3 I' m having problems with getting up everyday and doing my daily routine. I feel bad because these are things that other people do normally. EOS 6 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah, I' ve definitely felt that way... especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day? EOS 6 0 5 Exactly. Jogging, eating breakfast, getting dressed. EOS 6 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yep, for me it' s kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just" take a break" from grinding. MTurk has kind of helped me get back in a working mindset and given me more energy... have you been doing a lot of MTurk lately?
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one. EOS 4 0 16 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. What else can I do besides meditation? EOS 4 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds?

I have a lot of trouble with that myself. EOS 0 0 2 going smooth, i need to get a nice and a surprise able present for my parent, and at the same time I need to pay my house bills. my father understands the situation that my earning is not that much, but my mum will fuck complain that I am taking care of my wife but not her. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you' re having some cash flow issues, right? I can relate to that at a few more points in my life than I' d points in my life than I' d like to recall. It' s so very loving and sweet of you to be putting so much thought into the gift! That isn' t all that common anymore, unfortunately.. Are you currently working? EOS 0 0 4 yes, your are right, I cannot stay in house without paying bills. yes, I am working but the income is not that much. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It is pretty ridiculous how income doesn' t increase along with inflation/ cost of living. Very illogical and crippling to many of us financially. Of course you' ll need to put your rent and utilities above all else, and since the gift you are feeling stressed out about is a parental gift, EOS 0 0 6 that is the major concern, the gift is once in a year and now all my bills are needed to be paid at least before end of the week. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think that you will find out that all your parents really want is for you to be happy and to get to spend some quality family time with you. They love you and want you to be happy and healthy. That is a gift a lot of parents don' t get, surprisingly..
1 0 0 im very upset. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry. Would you like to tell me about it? EOS 1 0 2 yes. i invited my friend over to watch my new puppy while i painted my room because my dog has seperation anxiety and can' t be alone. then she showed up with her new boyfriend. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] What bothered you about that? EOS 1 0 4 well i dont know him and my stuff was all out in the living room where he was alone for most of the day. i actually didnt suspect anything would happen at first. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can see why that would upset you though. Did something happen? EOS 1 0 6 yes, after they left, i started putting my stuff back in my room and realized the purse i keep my nintendo switch in was GONE. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m so sorry that happened to you. I would be very upset as well. EOS 1 0 8 i' ve known her for 8 years. but this guy is very new. they' re not even officially together. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Did you speak to your friend about it? EOS 1 0 10 yes, so i called her and asked her if she saw my bag and she got defensive. she started talking about how much money he has and how he doesnt have to steal. EOS 1 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It is sometimes hard for people to believe someone they care about could do something bad. EOS 1 0 12 but she should care about me more!! she barely knows him. EOS 1 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have been in a similar situation with a friend and her husband; when he was exhibiiing bad behavior, she did not want to see it in him. I agree that she should value you your friendship more than someone she just met.
3 0 0 Hi, How are you doing? I am in bad mood.. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] What' s wrong?
7 0 0 Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well. EOS 7 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well I can help you study if you' d like? EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material... EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study! EOS 7 0 4 My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted. EOS 7 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version. EOS 7 0 6 Wow, that' s actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me. EOS 7 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot. EOS 7 0 8 That is true. I will reach out to her now. EOS 7 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will do just fine, you can do it! EOS 7 0 10 I still have some self - doubt given that I have failed an exam in the past... EOS 7 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam. EOS 7 0 12 I really appreciate this advice. I am feeling better about the exam and feel like I should envision myself passing and doing well. EOS 7 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, thats the spirit it works for me! EOS 7 0 14 I will give it a try! EOS 7 1 15 [Question] Okay is there anything else I can help you with or should I let you go? EOS 7 0 16 No, I should go study now. thank you for your help. EOS 7 1 17 [Others] Of course anytime, have a goodnight! EOS 7 0 18 You too! Wait! I have another concern. EOS 7 1 19 [Question] Yes, what is that?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 hi. Could you please help?. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How are you tonight?. EOS 3 0 3 I am okay. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 3 0 5 I caught my gf texting another guy. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So from what I understand, you caught your significant other texting someone else.. EOS 3 0 7 yes right. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] What types of things was she texting him about? EOS 3 0 9 Asking about what he was doing later. What he likes to do for fun. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Just from the few messages we have sent, I can tell you are very anxious and upset about this situation.. EOS 3 0 11 yes for sure, i was so shocked and disappointed. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand this as I had issues with my ex fiancé texting other guys and cheating on me.. EOS 3 0 13 Oh no! thats horrible too. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how hard a situation like this is, but I know you can get through it! EOS 3 0 15 Thanks so much! I think I can too. Thanks for sharing with me. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to have a conversation with her about it? EOS 3 0 17 No I feel like she should come to me about it since she was caught. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] What if she doesn' t know you caught her? EOS 3 0 19 I saw her do it. She didn' t really say a whole lot, she just left right afterwards. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think it would definitely help to talk to her about it, it is never good to let situations like this build up without being talked about.. EOS 3 0 21 That' s probably true, just a bit awkward. EOS 3 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I can definitely understand the awkwardness of the conversation, it was tough for me to have that conversation as well.. EOS 3 0 23 And I agree about making sure I talk with her. It' s not healthy. EOS 3 1 24 [Others] It is definitely not healthy. EOS 3 0 25 Thanks for being supportive. Relationships are tough. EOS 3 1 26 [Question] They are very tough. Did you need anything else from me tonight?.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? I' d love to chat with you! What' s been on your mind? EOS 3 0 1 oh hello. I' m having problems with friends - or more precisely the lack of them. I don' t have any. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see. You feel as though you don' t have any friend' s currently? I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It' s so hard to see people and keep relationships right now.
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? EOS 1 0 22 He' s a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly. EOS 1 0 24 But maybe I deserved it. EOS 1 1 25 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly. EOS 1 0 26 Yes, he did. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No you did not! Please don' t think like that. EOS 1 0 28 I' m just so angry that I could break something. And maybe I will do that! EOS 1 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this. EOS 1 0 30 But what if it doesn' t pass? And I cannot afford therapy. EOS 1 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now. There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free. EOS 1 0 32 I don' t know if I could do that. I don' t like talking about my problems with strangers. EOS 1 1 33 [Self-disclosure] And yet here we are: P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found.. I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that I was. EOS 1 0 34 Do you have any suggestions about how to open up to people I don' t know? EOS 1 1 35 [Others] I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No - one will be judging you. EOS 1 0 36 That' s what I am afraid of. Being judged by people. EOS 1 1 37 [Question] Do you think that this might partly because your ex has eroded your self esteem?.
5 0 0 im depressed and angry. EOS 5 1 1 [Question] why would you say that?
3 1 0 [Question] Hi! Hope you are doing well? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, yes am doing well. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Glad to know that you are doing well. How may I assist you today?

EOS 3 0 19 Thank you I will definitely avoid drinking and any thing else that may contribute to such kind of issues. EOS 3 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you got the solution. have a wonderful time. EOS 3 0 21 Thank you for the assistance. Really appreciates.

3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability. EOS 3 0 21 i applied for disability but didn' t get it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself. EOS 3 0 23 yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn' t matter. EOS 3 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Social Security stopped you. Why? EOS 3 0 25 i' m not injured enough for them. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can file against the company if you can prove neglect in the employer.. Were there proper safety guards. EOS 3 0 27 I tried but since it is the state of PA they have immunity. no. EOS 3 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was a state injury, there must be an avenue you can use to prove neglect. EOS 3 0 29 I was told that I assumed the risk of injury working for them. It was a mental hospital. EOS 3 1 30 [Question] have you contacted OSHA and filed a complaint with them?
2 0 0 Hello. Maybe you can help me calm down. I just found out that I' m losing my job in January.( 1) EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hello! I hope I can. I am so sorry to hear that. That' s so rough. There are so many people going through this right now. EOS 2 0 2 Yes and that worries me even more. More people competing for the same jobs.( 2) EOS 2 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a fare worry but you can' t be discourged. YOu need to think positively. You can use this as a time to reconnect with family and to get your resume together. EOS 2 0 4 I will have to do a new resume definitely. It' s been awhile.( 3) EOS 2 1 5 [Question] That' s a good activity!! Do you have anyone who can help you with it? EOS 2 0 6 I' ll have to think on that, I have a friend that might be able to help but it' s been awhile for both of us( 4) EOS 2 1 7 [Question] Do you have any hobbies you can work on while you' re home? EOS 2 0 8 Well I don' t think they are hobbies, but there are things that need to be done around the house. Guess I can keep myself busy at least( 5) EOS 2 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s really helpfuL! staying busy is good. It' s also really good time to reconnect with a loved ones and friends. You can try virtual connections.
0 0 0 Good afternoon. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Good afternoon. how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I am not good at all. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] oh no. I am sorry, what happened? EOS 0 0 4 This pandemic is causing too much of trouble for me. Firstly pay cut and now about to layoff. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. This pandemic terrible. sorry to hear that. EOS 0 0 6 My company don' t want to consider any body at all. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s pretty tough. You' re like the 3rd person today who have been going through this, EOS 0 0 8 And I don' t know what to do. EOS 0 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Can they work with another company to secure you a job or can you come back to work later if you get lay off? EOS 0 0 10 I don' t even know what they will decide. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Can you talk to your boss possibly and let him know you could do other job to help your boss so that you won' t get laid off? EOS 0 0 12 This is not affecting only one person it is affecting every body in the company. Nobody know who is next. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see. If it is really likely to happen, I would brush up my resume, make it stand out, but job search can be really stressful. EOS 0 0 14 The jobs are not there any more. Many people are affecting because of pandemic. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] I see. Startimg your own business is something that could help. What do you think? Totally agree. EOS 0 0 16 Business? without capital now, it can' t work. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, for example teaching something doesnt need much capital. I am trying to become some online tutor at some point. what do you think?
0 0 0 I am really feeling the loneliness of the season and being isolated. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Good evening. EOS 0 0 2 Good evening. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just so I understand, the holiday season is making you feel alone and isolated. EOS 0 0 4 Yes as well as the virus. Are we out of time. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Is there anything in particular about the holidays that is bothering you?
4 0 0 I am so embarassed and saddened. I can not believe he cheated on me. I thought we were going to work out. I was really attracted into him and I cared for him a lot. I wanted to date him longer. Thank Goodness I did not sleep with him. What a disaster. Why are men like this? Why do they break women' s hearts? I wish there were more decent men out there that did not play around. Men can be such pigs! EOS 4 1 1 [Question] what happened? EOS 4 0 2 I met a handsome intelligent man. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how are you feeling lately? EOS 4 0 4 We dated for a month. Then out of nowhere he cheated on me. I' m so sad. I am just trying to understand what I did wrong. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s okay. we should learn from things like this. EOS 4 0 6 That' s true. It' s crazy we have to experience heart ache. To learn... EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] don' t think much and keep yourself engaged in the activities you like the most. EOS 4 0 8 Hey, that is great advice! EOS 4 1 9 [Question] can you tell me how are you before this incident? EOS 4 0 10 I was happy. But when a man breaks your heart, it makes you feel very ugly. EOS 4 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] can you share me some happy memories which made you smile. EOS 4 0 12 Sure, I love going to the movies! How about you! EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] it' s okay. i can understand. yeah me too. i love movies and traveling. EOS 4 0 14 Are you American? EOS 4 1 15 [Others] I love traveling to new places.
4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out. EOS 4 0 6 I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night? EOS 4 0 8 I can' t sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it' s typically late afternoon. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds like you are doing the very best you can under difficult circumstances. you should feel very proud about that. EOS 4 0 10 thank you. i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] it sounds to me that your sleep issue is really weighing on your mind. you may be setting yourself up for sleep issues by thinking about this so much. is that possible? EOS 4 0 12 yes it may be. i' m not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you' re under a lot of pressure. it' s only natural that you would feel overwhelmed. dont be hard on yourself. you' re doing the best you can. EOS 4 0 14 thank you. that is very supportive. i just dont know how to make the next ten days go by faster. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can spend some time doing pleasant things. it is true that time seems to go fast when we' re having fun. EOS 4 0 16 that' s true. i thought about maybe playing video games. EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] fantastic! that' s a great way to spend your time. EOS 4 0 18 maybe overwatch. i haven' t been playing them much. EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] i' m wondering: are you a reader? do you enjoy reading? i' m asking because i find when i read a good book, time seems to move very quickly. EOS 4 0 20 i am. but i have a hard time focusing as of late. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can make a goal of reading a few pages and then see if you can build on that. then, if you want, you can make a goal of reading a chapter. EOS 4 0 22 that' s a great idea. that may help a lot with focus. EOS 4 1 23 [Self-disclosure] personally i love reading; especially non fiction. what type of books do you enjoy? EOS 4 0 24 dystopian fantasy style books. and also historical nonfiction. EOS 4 1 25 [Self-disclosure] i enjoy historical non fiction very much. do you have any favorite authors? EOS 4 0 26 lauren destefano. her series the chemical garden trilogy is my favorite. EOS 4 1 27 [Question] has she written anything you haven' t read yet that you think you would enjoy? EOS 4 0 28 that' s also another good idea. i haven' t read all of her bookis. EOS 4 1 29 [Question] do you live near a library? EOS 4 0 30 i do but they' re closed because of covid. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] there may be some libraries in your area that are open, or have reduced hours. EOS 4 0 32 i can try. the bookstores are open. EOS 4 1 33 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wonderful! do you live near a book store?
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with this evening?. EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very depressed lately. Like a constant pressure that i don' t know exactly what it is. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I' m very sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 4 0 3 I think the days getting shorter makes it worse. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating. EOS 4 0 5 Do you have any tips on how to overcome it? EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help. I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through Instagram. I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while.. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up. I like to stay up, but when it' s time to get up i dread it. Bad cycle. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sure, that' s understandable. There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin D, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them.. EOS 4 0 9 Time is the fire in which we burn. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] Now that is intractable. EOS 4 0 11 Lol... yes it is. The pandemic heightens all our awareness of time and mortality. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes, to me, the enormity of the universe is calming to my anxiety. Being assured that I mean absolutely nothing is nice sometimes. EOS 4 0 13 And drives the civil unrest which makes me feel anxious and insecure. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] Not in a scary, better - off - dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion. I' m a flea to the universe. EOS 4 0 15 Yes i find that a strangly comforting thought. EOS 4 1 16 [Others] ... then you have to wonder, what are fleas thinking?!. EOS 4 0 17 They have the luxury of instinct without having to" think" at all. EOS 4 1 18 [Others] God, tell me more, lol. EOS 4 0 19 They just be fleas. Fleas gonna flea. EOS 4 1 20 [Others] Galaxies gonna spiral. EOS 4 0 21 I worry too that the U. S. government has no idea what it' s doing. And the people at large are all losing their mental health. EOS 4 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah they have kicked the can down to local governments, local governments kick the can down to the citizens. It' s absurd. No on wants to take responsibility for taking responsibility.. It' s a very uncertain situation and it' s a psychological reality that when we don' t have physical or metnal security, it' s extremely hard for a human being to progress through stages in life or learn new skill as well or at all.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 0 0 2 Just feeling sad. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad? EOS 0 0 4 Not being able to leave the house with Covid. plus my hours were cut at work. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut. What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time? EOS 0 0 6 Yes it sucks. I live alone now so there really hard sometimes. I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos. Nothing productive. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it' s not the same as face to face. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I have one close friend that I talk to every now and then. Its not like it use to be. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That' s still a win. EOS 0 0 10 We used to be able to go out and have a few beers together.. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. Keep that connection. It' s not going to be the same due to the circumstances. But at least you are seeking to keep that connection, and that is a good thing. EOS 0 0 12 I hope that this vaccine thing is reason and we can get back to the norm.. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it' s not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest. EOS 0 0 14 Good idea.. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well. But I am hoping they get it right, and not just rush to get something out there that may or may not work. EOS 0 0 16 I like to do home repairs. Maybe I can find a group for that. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway. EOS 0 0 18 Do you use any other social media for connecting with new people. EOS 0 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I use Facebook, Instagram, and sometimes TikTok. You should do mini videos on easy things to DIY on TikTok.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello how are you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I am good, how are you? EOS 3 0 3 I am doing well just dealing with some problems with my friends. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I' m sorry, what type of problems are you having? EOS 3 0 5 Friends not being there for me when I need emotional support. They also do not pay for their stuff when we go out to eat or go to the bar as well. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand, you are having issues with your friends not being there for you emotionally and you are worried about them taking advantage of you when you go out..
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 I' m good. How about you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Very little to complain about today. What brings you here? EOS 3 0 3 Just want to talk some random stuff basically just want a companion. EOS 3 1 4 [Others] How' s the weather where you are? EOS 3 0 5 Still pretty cold and dry in here, how about there? EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Exactly the same. What are you doing to stay warm? EOS 3 0 7 Just in my long pajamas with heater. I don' t really know what to do anymore, I am just lazy on everything. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well you' re resourceful at staying warm, at least. You mentioned wanting a companion, are you living alone? EOS 3 0 9 not really I' m living with my family but I don' t really talk to them anymore I' m just in my room all day. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Is it the stress of the pandemic getting to you& your family, or something else?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there how can be of help? EOS 3 0 2 I am suffering from low mood and general depression. I don' t know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down( obviously) and there doesn' t appear to be any real reason behind it. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue? EOS 3 0 4 I felt this way for a while actually isn' t a recent change it' s been building slowly over time. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same? EOS 3 0 6 I think I know what you mean. It' s getting worse. I feel very down. EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse.
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today?
2 0 0 Good evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hi, how' s things? EOS 2 0 2 Things are ok I am just having issues with the problem above. EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I am afraid that I am not able to see that.. can you tell me about it? EOS 2 0 4 Yes, so I have always done very well in school and university. I have always had A' s or high B' s. Last semester in university, I failed one of my exams. I still passed the class with an A, but for some reason, that exam haunts me and gives me bad dreams. I don' t know why it happens and it worries me. EOS 2 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - when I was sitting my final exams I constantly had nightmares about failing. Nearly thirty years on and I still do!! But - you did really very well and you passed with an A. Do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself? EOS 2 0 6 Maybe, I got a 46% on the exam( so an F) but I did all my other assignments and exams almost perfect and got an A overall. I never once failed a test in my life, and have always held myself to a very high academic degree to make my parents proud. I come from a poor family, so succeeding in life is very important to m, e. me* EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds as though you feel that academic success is the most important thing in your life, would I be right in thinking this?
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out.
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why? EOS 4 0 8 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID - 19 lockdowns. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] How long have you been working there?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 Am ok but feeling sad and anxious. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that you are sad and anxious. Do you know what is causing you to feel that way? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I recently lost my childhood best friend to covid 19. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can only imagine how sad you feel from losing your best friend. Hopefully chatting some will help. I know in the past when I lost someone it was nice to just have a conversation to help put my mind at ease. EOS 0 0 5 Sure. I feel so lonely sometimes because we were very close. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that you are feeling lonely. Did you have any mutual friends with your best friend that you can reach out to? I am sure they are feeling the same way and it could help both of you to talk to each other and share stories. EOS 0 0 7 Yes we have mutual friends. I do reach out to them sometimes. But the feeling doesn' t go away. It makes me have sleepless nights. I can' t sleep. Every time I close my eyes I see him very close to me like we are having conversations. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you were really close to your best friend. It can take time to get through the grief of losing someone. Things will get better I promise. EOS 0 0 9 I hope so too. And I hope he is a better place. Have you ever lost someone close to you? EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I lost my father when I was 19. That was pretty tough and it took me years to be OK with it. There are still days a decade later where I think about him and miss him.
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! How are you today? EOS 3 0 2 Ok I guess. I do not know how to tell my husband that I am lonely and I want out of the marriage. EOS 3 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, that sure is a heavy subject and a heavy thing to be on your mind. EOS 3 0 4 He is not one you can talk to he usually just brushes things off. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have tried to discuss your loneliness with your husband before? EOS 3 0 6 Yes he tells me it’s just in my head and I could just go out with him, but he drinks then to much so I do not like going out with him. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] I am sure that is frustrating! Does he drink at home as well or just when you go out? EOS 3 0 8 Just when he goes out I do not go with him I do not drink and drive. And he hangs with some obnoxious people. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Would a date night at home with take - out and a movie just the two of you be an option? EOS 3 0 10 He would go to sleep, and then he thinks I am crazy he says we are no kids anymore that need to go on a date we are married. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you think you both might be open to talking to a marriage counselor? EOS 3 0 12 I want that but I doubt he will talk he tells me he has no problems I have them, and all it does is I doubt myself. I turned this situation in every direction and I just am not able to find a solution. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, what about you finding a counselor for yourself who could help you with your own self - care? Perhaps it could be a start and then he/ she could help you end your marriage if you still want to. It took me awhile to learn my own value and how important self - care is. EOS 3 0 14 You know what I like that idea. Maybe you are right I might get then some self esteem as well again. EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know from experience that our self esteem suffers when we' re in an unhappy marriage. It takes a lot of courage to seek help so I applaud you!
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling?
4 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hai. EOS 4 0 1 Hai. My name is Tom and i really need your help. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok tell me. EOS 4 0 3 I am really sad and stressed up knowing that I am soon losing my job due to the effects of corona virus. For sure if I lose my job now I might go to depression because I have a family to take care of. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, don' t worry friend, EOS 4 0 5 Are there any ways you know that could help me convince my boss that that it is not the right time to cut down on manpower? EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] lot of people lose the job in this corona time. just explain you situation. EOS 4 0 7 Incase i lose the job, are there ways that can help me stay out of stress of losing the job? I am worried that losing a job may cause me a lot of harm since my bills depend on my current job. EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] definitely, you have to try to get the other work. don' t give up your confident, belive your self.
2 0 0 Hey. I am really scared about my job prospects. I am really fearful about my job situation. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] When did this fear start? EOS 2 0 2 It has been a while. I have had fears going back to my childhood traumas. I think that the work situation has only exacerbated that. The current economic climate has really made me fearful.... not sure if I am going to be able to keep my job. EOS 2 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct? EOS 2 0 4 Somewhat. But, my fears are relevant because I don' t know if I will always have a job. EOS 2 1 5 [Question] Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job? EOS 2 0 6 Do you know what I mean? What say u? I have some, but they have their own problems to deal with. Everyone has problems. Do you know what I mean? EOS 2 1 7 [Self-disclosure] You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me. EOS 2 0 8 It is making me have flashbacks of other traumatic situations, I think I need to find a good support chain, for sure. What say u? You take alooonnng time to respond. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many counselors who specialize in this field of job security and especially during this pandemic and the falling economy, they are great support systems. EOS 2 0 10 I am having a hard time.... Ok, I will look some of them online. I need some financial planners to help as well. Many Americans are hurting. EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic. EOS 2 0 12 Any other advices? What else can you advise me on? Should I look elsewhere for jobs? I will have to try that. Maybe it can help me ease my mind. EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Since a lot of this stress is being caused by your childhood trauma, it seems like there is something that connects that job to your trauma and if it cant be disconnected, it seems like you should find another job. And I understand that is not the easiest in these times but I believe you can do it!
4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 tired. and u? EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like an exhausting time for a lot of people right now. I' m also a bit tired but doing OK. What' s been on your mind recently? EOS 4 0 3 just trying to finish this semester. EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like a stressful time to be in college. How have you been coping with everything going on? EOS 4 0 5 listening to music. EOS 4 1 6 [Others] Nice! What kind of music do you like? EOS 4 0 7 mainly hip hop and r& b but I dabble in some alternative, hyperpop, and edm. EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I also like hip hop and r& b. It' s too bad we aren' t able to go to any live music events for a while, though. EOS 4 0 9 yea. have u done any of the virtual concerts? EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I' ve seen them advertised but I haven' t tried any of them yet. I think I saw there was a Lil Nas X one coming up though, might check that out. Have you done any? EOS 4 0 11 yea the travis scott one and the nas one just happened yesterday. think there is only one showing left today then theyre done. it was ok nothing amazing. EOS 4 1 12 [Others] Oh good to know. Yeah, I don' t know if virtual concerts can ever really compare to live ones. EOS 4 0 13 whos some of your favorite artists? EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Well, I' m in my 30s so I like the artists who were big about the time I was in high school/ college since I have fond memories of that. So, artists like Nelly, 50 cent, Eminem. Also I' m from California so I have to say Tupac. What about you? EOS 4 0 15 I love those guys too. Need to listen to more of their discographys though. My favorites are kendrick lamar and kanye west. 15 mins past. I guess we' re done. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yeah, Kendrick is awesome and makes actual meaningful music. Kanye also is super talented, sadly he seems to have his issues, but don' t we all! It was great talking to you:) Nice to find someone with shared music tastes. Hope you have a great rest of ur weekend and good luck with finishing your semester!
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Same old.. still trying to lose weight. Already on day 20 for fasting. did not lose a single pound. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight. What kind of methods have you been using? EOS 0 0 4 I tried keto diet for 6 months, didn' t work. So now on Fasting. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are really discouraged. EOS 0 0 6 I also go to gym 2 times a week. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow! You have been trying practically everything. You are really motivated. EOS 0 0 8 Yea, very discouraged... EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Losing weight can be difficult. I' ve struggled with that many times. Have you thought of consulting a dietician or a nutritionist to help? Maybe, they would offer some new suggestions. EOS 0 0 10 I am already lucky that I can sometime able to book swimming pool close by. I considered but they said I am not overweight. EOS 0 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like they didn' t listen to your needs. And it seems like you are doing a great job exercising at the pool and employing other methods to lose weight. What is your primary motivation behind your weight loss goal? EOS 0 0 12 The added weight is putting pressure on my hips and knees.. Causing a lot of pain as well for my lower back. EOS 0 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] That' s no good. I' ll bet that is difficult to deal with. Have you thought about teaming up with a friend and going on daily walks? EOS 0 0 14 No, I have to look after the kids.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, you could also take the kids on a walk every day. That would be a healthy activity to enjoy together, and it should help burn some of their energy too. EOS 0 0 16 I signed them up for swimming classes so they can exercise too. Thanks for your suggestion though. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s great! Now you can all go swimming together. Maybe that can be an activity that you all do together a couple times a week. EOS 0 0 18 I can' t join their classes. Yes, I am doing that.. EOS 0 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No, but I' m sure that there is a fitness club or city pool where you all can share your skills. EOS 0 0 20 And even after exercise, I only eat 20% of their portion and no junk food. Nice speaking to you though, you have been very kind. EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you. I enjoyed our conversation as well. Keep swimming. I' m sure you will get to where you want to be in no time.
3 0 0 hi im sad. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Anything particular got you down? Hello. EOS 3 0 2 just life, bad year. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea bad year for everyone. The virus has really stopped us. Are you working or on layoff. EOS 3 0 4 yes it has, the political turmoil in the United States is very scary as well. I am self employed. but not working alot. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is an understatement with the politics. What do you do. EOS 3 0 6 I am a writer. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I Freelance my self. Do you work for anyone or just in general.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that? EOS 0 0 21 being on the board gives me perks. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit? EOS 0 0 23 yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there' s an element of mutual manipulation. EOS 0 0 25 yes. EOS 0 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are definitely not the only person to feel this way! EOS 0 0 27 it' s a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power.. what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board. EOS 0 0 29 i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment. EOS 0 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] But that is rather manipulative of you. EOS 0 0 31 if you were me you would forget about him and the board. EOS 0 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I definitely would do that. EOS 0 0 33 thing is he is encouraging me to be like that. cuz it helps him too. okay. i' ll try to lay low and walk away from it. EOS 0 1 34 [Others] I think it' s time for a clear severance. Do you have any other people you are interested in? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 35 yes but it' s less than before cuz of Covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this - if that makes sense. EOS 0 1 36 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah I hear you. You feel that your options are rather more limited than previously because of the lockdown? EOS 0 0 37 yes. EOS 0 1 38 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is something I believe that most of us are feeling right now so I sympathise. EOS 0 0 39 true. i just have to be strong about it with him. even if he likes me i don' t think it' s a healthy relationship. i slept with one of his friends and the other one wanted to sleep with me too. EOS 0 1 40 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be. Is he aware that this happened? EOS 0 0 41 yes when it comes down to it. he suspected it happened. his friend asked the one i slept with if it was true. he denied it. so i think he suspected it. EOS 0 1 42 [Question] Do you feel guilty about this?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi! What' s on your mind tonight?. EOS 4 0 1 I think a friend I' ve known for 30 years since college has drifted away from me. Even during the pandemic she has made new friends. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, I' m sorry, that' s not fun at all, especially since you two have been friends for so long. Have you tried reaching out to her by phone, email or social media?. EOS 4 0 3 She has cut our conversations short by saying she is tried. She will return text but I feel like I am always initiating. She likes watching tv show and told me with her NEW friend they Facetime and watch TV together. I really hate watching TV so don' t want to offer to participate. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, it' s a positive sign that she hasn' t blocked you completely. I agree, texting her each day could irritate her. That' s okay! You shouldn' t do anything that isn' t fun or enjoyable or comfortable for either of you, in my opinion. EOS 4 0 5 I am jealous that she is more successful in making new friends. I have not made a new friend in over 10 years. EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life. EOS 4 0 7 I don' t have many other friends and they are out of state. The one we are talking about lived an hour away but we would see each other 4 to 6 times a year, EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you' re saying you feel hurt and depressed at not being able to make new friends easily in the pandemic, correct? Ahhhh.,..... yes that; s difficult, oh boy. EOS 4 0 9 Hurt, mad, jealous. I have trouble getting out enough to make friends - even if there wasn' t a pandemic. I work a lot. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] For the time being we' re all stuck at home mostly, so maybe take some comfort in that in a strange way. Heck I rarely see my friends - maybe once a year, so I know how that feels.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 The season has me down. No family around. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Are you finding time to do things you enjoy by yourself? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 3 trying to work and write but lack motivation. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are feeling some lethargy in this cold season, and feel as though you have no support from your family. EOS 0 0 5 I don' t talk to anyone. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any plans to spend Christmas with family or friends? That may help to break the cycle of feeling low? EOS 0 0 7 I live in a hotel currently. No family or friends around, especially with the virus. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What do you do for work? Are you able to get out of the hotel frequently? EOS 0 0 9 I am a writer. Witht he virus it is hard to meet anyone. i am only here until next week then I have to go to Virignia. My children r all over the country. EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I agree, it is hard to spend time with people at the moment. We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted. It would be good to have something positive to look forward to. EOS 0 0 11 I try the dating sites, but they seem to far away or impersonal. Hope things are better. Just the current season ahs me down. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I can see that. Keep in touch with your family and try to think of positive, happy times you can all have together in the future. EOS 0 0 13 No verbal communication makes it hard. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Can you call them? EOS 0 0 15 I try but the loneliness is the hard part. EOS 0 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this loneliness is really getting to you and you are struggling to see a way forwards. As you are a writer could you perhaps try to make some online friends in forums? EOS 0 0 17 It is just the lack of communication. EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear you. Perhaps you could call one of your children now? See if they' d like to catch - up? EOS 0 0 19 without any communication it makes it seem like a battle alone. My daughter is busy and 3 hours away. different time zones amke it hard. EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] Maybe schedule in a call with her for the future? I have been making time to speak with my family every Tuesday, it gives us something to look forward to each week. EOS 0 0 21 Children can only share so much. I chat with her, but the timing is off. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] What are your plans in Virginia?
1 0 0 I am so mad that I can' t see straight. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello! What is on your mind today? Oh really? Why is that? EOS 1 0 2 Well, my boyfriend has cheated so many times that I cant count them. I then meet someone nice and cheat on him once and now he breaks up with me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] being mad that your boyfriend cheated is normal. being mad when dumped is normal. don' t you think you DESERVE better than he was treating you? EOS 1 0 4 Thank you! I can see that I am talking to someone who understands. I am wondering if I should beg him back?? I really do love him. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there too. Expecially with covid, it can be hard realiing you may be alone and it may be frusterating dating someone new. if you really love someone, shouldnt they love you back? did his actions show love? EOS 1 0 6 Yeah, and we have been together since high school so it is really hard to think of ever marrying anyone else. He asked me to marry him but we never made it official or got rings. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak. i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart. EOS 1 0 8 He told me he never wants kids with me but acts like he would have them someday, somehow? I think you' re right. EOS 1 1 9 [Self-disclosure] i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter. trust me, its not worth it in the long run. maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you! EOS 1 0 10 Noway! That is my worst nightmare, I am so sorry. That is a real eye opener for me/ That is exactly what I don' t think I could handle. I just am in the worst cycle ever and don' t have any friends to turn to or anybody who wants to listen to the drama. I think I have wasted a lot of my life and I can' t ever get the time back that I have invested in him. EOS 1 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i think a lot of couples are feeling stuck with covid. once things open up and everyone is vaccinated and get togethers happen again, i bet there will be a LOT more breakups and a lot more options out there! all we can do is learn from our mistakes and not let the past repeat itself. EOS 1 0 12 Yeah, I can see your point. It is nice being able to vent to you and feel like I am being heard. I never got that in my relationship with him. I need to learn from the past this time and stop repeating it. EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] with your newly aquired free time, you can focus on you! start a new hobby, dye your hair, do something you always wanted to do! EOS 1 0 14 I haven' t even had the time to get myself cute and fixed up in forever! I love that idea! I need to get my haircut. EOS 1 1 15 [Question] know what the best part is?
1 0 0 I' m having issues with my parents. You can say we are having a conflict. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] What kind of issues do you think you are having? EOS 1 0 2 well they won' t allow me to date this girl i met online.. They told she' s bad news. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today. Have you tried talking to you parents about why she is" bad news"? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, i tried but it won' t get through their head. There are so old school. They want me to date someone close to my age. is 15 year difference too big of a gap? EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] The basic problem is that your parents believe that 15 years is too large of an age gap between you guys. Is there any other reasons your parents dissaporve of her?
4 0 0 Hi I am so sad my boyfriend was cheating and broke up with me when I found out. I don' t think I can ever be happy again. EOS 4 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self - esteem is that true? EOS 4 0 2 I have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. I have lost interest in everything I can barely make myself go to work. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better? EOS 4 0 4 Maybe, why would he cheat? I have seen her she is not that pretty. I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination. EOS 4 1 5 [Others] remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren' t right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else. EOS 4 0 6 I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn' t want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn' t mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that. EOS 4 0 8 I trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. I thought we were so perfect together, I don' t want him back I could never trust him again, I am not sure I could trust any guy right now, I am so hurt and confused. I don' t ever want to feel like this again. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] relationship issues, especially when they and suddenly can be one of the most stressful periods in an adults life. you are not alone in that other people have been through similar experiences themselves. EOS 4 0 10 This was the first guy I ever lived with, I thought we would get married one day. How do people make it through the pain, it actually hurts. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?. EOS 4 0 12 I have a couple acquaintances at work but I wouldn' t want to discuss my personal life with, my mom said to have a good cry but I almost couldn' t stop once I started. He was my best friend and who I talked to once we got together I didn' t seem to need anyone else which looks like a mistake now. That is why I am here for support. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ok I understand. It is normal to be upset in a situation like this. When I ask if there is someone to talk to, I meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup. There are also support groups out there that can really help. Getting your emotions out and seeing that others struggle with the same issue may be a very good thing. EOS 4 0 14 Have you ever had a break up of a serious relationship or know someone who has? Does the aching inside ever get better? How long will it take? EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] When I was younger, my girlfriend cheated on me. We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it' s better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married. I loved her but after she cheated, I couldn' t stand the sight of her. I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy. EOS 4 0 16 I am sorry that happened to you but glad it turned out well in the end. You have a good point that it is better to know now than after we got married. I do have a nice neighbor who expressed concern when he noticed my boyfriend was gone. He said if I ever needed someone to talk to he was there. I thought he was just being nice. Maybe I should go talk to him some time maybe he was sincere. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think that that would be a good idea! for info, In terms of how long it takes to get over it. I have read a statistic that is takes half the length of the relationship to truly get over it. Personally I think it does depend on the person and how things end in terms of the breakup.
3 0 0 i am feeling sad. my boyfriend left me out of the blue. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so sorry for hearing that. Do you want to talk more detail about that? EOS 3 0 2 yes, i want to. i am unable to concentrate in anything. i feel so negative about my life. what is the point of this relationship then? EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You seem really focus on just one person. Life is rich. Think about other important people in your life such as parents, friends. EOS 3 0 4 i can understand all of this. may be i need some time. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes of course you should take your time as long as you want and you can do it, one day you can leave all those problem. EOS 3 0 6 hoping the same. want to be the happy person like i was before. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Also do exercise, yoga, workout, talk your friends, listen to music etc sort of things might help you a lot. whatever works for you, you' ll try them out. Just chatting with you, you seem very a smart, strong girl. Do not be upset about things you can' t control. EOS 3 0 8 i think i should divert my concentration on something else. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] For sure, what else we need to talk about?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day, how are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 Not too well. I have been depessed because of our state shut down and today an old friend from unior high school passed. EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that. I absolutely understand, it' s been hard on most people having to deal with the current state of affairs and losing people.. Do you think things will improve? EOS 3 0 3 Thank you. I know we are all in the same predicament.. I think things will improve, but not for a year or more.. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I agree. I lost a teacher some time ago and I' ve been thinking a lot about when things might improve. A year seems plausible. Since it' s so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up? EOS 3 0 5 A year is a long time when y. A year is a long time when you are 76 years old. I just want to enjoy the rest of our lives - my husband and me - and travel until we can' t enjoy it any longer. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that. It is really tough being restricted to not travelling. I call my parents( around your age) about once a week. EOS 3 0 7 Thank you so much for your support. It is tough and there is nothing to do. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have family you can talk to? Have you considered volunteering? I ask because my neighbor bakes for the local food bank and it helps her. EOS 3 0 9 Yes, I do, but I can' t talk to my son in Florida because he lost his job and havng tough time. I don' t feel like I should enjoy my life when he is suffering. We may need to help him financially. I use to volunteer at a nursing home, but I am afraid to now with the virus. EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is reasonable. And it sounds like you are doing all you can. Could you teach from home online and keep yourself safe? Or perhaps provide your son financial support?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 0 0 1 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am doing great, how about you? EOS 0 0 3 I am doing good. Can I talk to you about something? EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course you can, tell me about it:) EOS 0 0 5 I am worried that I won' t be able to complete my degree. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Why so? EOS 0 0 7 I can' t get motivated, it doesn' t seem worth it. EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Hey I' ve been there too, but it really helped me meditating and going out with nature to clear my mind of things. You should try it! EOS 0 0 9 What do you meditate about? EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Nothing special, just sit in my room in silence. Listen to tutorials on youtube to meditate. They get me relaxed and motivated for the day:) EOS 0 0 11 I feel like I would sit there and worry about things I have not done yet. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s part of meditation! I too worry while meditating, but when i' m listening to the videos and following instructions all those worries go away:) If that doesn' t help you, you can go out in nature to clear your mind off things. Being in the wild really motivates me to continue. EOS 0 0 13 Maybe it will calm me down. Does it make it easier to concentrate?. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Meditating absolutely does since the whole point is to clear your mind off things and concentrate on the task ahead. And the wild? that' s whole other experience because you either concentrate on things or you get mesmerized by nature:) EOS 0 0 15 That sounds amazing, I should give it a try:) EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Please do! You can try it with friends or alone. With friends can be a more fun experience while alone can be more spiritual or calming. I have tried both and both are amazing:)
4 1 0 [Question] hi how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Not good, i am very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i' m sorry. whats making you sad? EOS 4 0 3 My friend just stopped talking to me and she won' t tell me the reason why. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] has she communicated via text or messanger? or has all communication stopped?
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed! EOS 7 0 7 And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that' s one method I have used.. Thank you for your trust in me.. EOS 7 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don' t overdo it..
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. EOS 3 0 16 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why.
0 0 0 Hi. Hello, can you help me? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I hope so. What kind of problem are you having?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 2 Feeling depressed as usual. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 4 Everything. Life. It' s awful. How many years do you really need to stop enjoying this place. Ya know what I mean. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand, but just to make sure I know what is going on fully, you are depressed in general and don' t know how to get through it.. EOS 3 0 6 I would say that is fairly accurate. Often times, I wish an asteroid would come down and begin the apocolypse.. Something to break up the routine. Don' t you find life utterly boring and repetitive?. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Just from these few messages, I can tell you are extremely upset about this.. I have had problems in the past with depression as well, I used to have severe anxiety as well.. EOS 3 0 8 Sorry to hear that. Anxiety and depression are dual bladed sword of badness. Really bad mixture. I never struggled too much with anxiety.. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It was tough. Have you thought about consulting a psychological professional to help with this issue? I did when I was going through my depression and it really helped.. EOS 3 0 10 NO! I would never do that. I' m already on anti depressants. That didn' t help at all.. I just don' t understand why people like life enough to make more people! It is madness! EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I didn' t like the meds that they gave me either, however I felt that talking to someone helped me a great deal.. EOS 3 0 12 Well, I' m glad it helped you. I' m not just saying that. Being depressed is awful.. What did it do for you? How so? EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] It was good to be able to talk to an objective third party about what was going on. It allowed me to get my feelings out without the threat of being judges or harrassed.. EOS 3 0 14 I understand. Well, I appreciate your time and advice. I just don' t feel like you and I are understanding each other very well, though. Anyway, you made your bonus. I appreciate you trying to help me, though. We got to talk for another 4 minutes though. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to focus on more of your hobbies in order to get your mind off of things? EOS 3 0 16 I used to have more hobbies. Now, I' m not so motivated to do much of anything anymore. I used to play instruments. I like hiking a little, but it is winter now. So... I can' t even do that. Plus... I have to travel really far to do that because there is nothing to hike that is very close. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Why did you stop playing insturments? EOS 3 0 18 I just lost interest. I' m losing interest in everything, man. I think it' s time for my heart to give out and make space for the new, ya know. Cross my fingers at least. Dying in your sleep would be best. Wouldn' t that be nice? You just drift off after your heart stops in a dream? EOS 3 1 19 [Others] I certainly hope you don' t do that!
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 im feeling pretty sad today. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 4 0 3 its about me and my friend got fight for misunderstanding. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like your feelings are hurt over a misunderstanding you had with a friend is this correct? EOS 4 0 5 yeah thats correct. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] I see i am sorry that it has you feeling down, did you try to talk with your friend to see if you could resolve your feelings? EOS 4 0 7 no he was not responding to me. he just avoiding me. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe you could send him a message on social media and let him know the argument has your feelings hurt and you would like to try to talk about it when he has time. EOS 4 0 9 thanks but he totally avoiding me he just blocked me and he ignore me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] how long have you been friends with him? EOS 4 0 11 for 5 years. but he thinks that i have affair with his girlfriend. EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] oh yea that can make things difficult, but i think if you keep reaching out you may could talk this over. Did you try to explain to him that his thoughts were not true? EOS 4 0 13 yeah but how should i start because he misjudged me and his girlfriend its a sensitive issue. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would start off by telling him that you were sorry that he had those thoughts but there is no truth to it and the fact that he does not trust you enough to know that is hurtful to you and her. If that does not work then you might need to take some time to reflect and figure out if that is a friendship worth trying to save, you may find yourself better off without a friend who shows no trust in you. EOS 4 0 15 please give me some suggegtion that what should i do now. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would continue trying to reach out to him and until you can get in touch with him maybe find some thing to do to occupy your mind as to where it does not bother you so much. do you have any hobbies?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 Hi, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Greeting] Doing good.. How are you? EOS 0 0 3 I' m feeling really anxious these days. I' m finding the COVID online learning experience to be too much for me at this time. I want to stop school, but I don' t think I can afford to. I need to get done with school. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand your frustration. All of us are challenged due to COVID. EOS 0 0 5 School was always hard. Now it' s gotten harder. I think a lot of people are stressed.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] How long are you doing the online school? EOS 0 0 7 Last semester and this semester. It feels like a lot longer though. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What are you missing most? Friends? EOS 0 0 9 A balance in life. I spend so much time online. I' m always staring at a screen. I would like to get aware from the computer. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] As the vaccination started, I believe we will be back to normal soon.. EOS 0 0 11 Yeah, I can' t wait for things to return to normal. Until then, I don' t know what I can do to feel normal. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I saw some of my friends hang out in zoom... having virtual drinks.. have you tried that? EOS 0 0 13 No, I haven' t. I thought it wouldn' t be the same as really hanging out. I don' t drink. I do like to play board games though. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It will not be same.. but better than being alone.. EOS 0 0 15 That' s true. I wanted to play board games online with some friends, but they weren' t interested. It' s not the same thing to play with strangers. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I have a group with my elementary school friends.. we hang out in zoom because we all are spread out across the globe.. some times.. it; s fun as we can share a lot of memories..
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hi, I feel really sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am sorry. What is going on? EOS 4 0 3 My friends won' t hang out with me. I am alone all the time. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel like they don' t want to be around you and have nobody to talk to? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, but also just no one to hang out with. I am a loner. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] You prefer it that way?. EOS 4 0 7 No. I want to hang out with people. EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I follow you. It is hard to see people outside of usual social circles right now with the pandemic going on. Out of curiosity tell me what you like doing with others? EOS 4 0 9 I like to talk with them, listen to their stories, just hang out have a good time.. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that. I have not seem my own friends for almost a year because of COVID - 19. It felt isolated and lonely. EOS 4 0 11 What do you do to feel better? EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It has not been easy but I focused on myself. I started doing more exercise and weight lifting. I took up learning how to invest money, and I also got into the habit of reading. Basically I build myself up in body, wallet, and mind so I feel better about myself progressively. It worked well for me at least. What do you think might help you? EOS 4 0 13 That all sounds great. I think I' ll need to do more exercising. I do like reading so I' ll do that too. Thank you for the suggestions! I appreciate it. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] What would you say might be good exercise or reading goals for you?. EOS 4 0 15 I think just start doing them and continue doing them are good goals for me for now. Thank you! I feel better! EOS 4 1 16 [Others] Whatever works for you. All the best and stay safe. EOS 4 0 17 All the best to you too! Good bye. EOS 4 1 18 [Greeting] Bye.

EOS 1 0 5 nothing i do pleases the man. all he does is complain. EOS 1 1 6 [Question] Ugh - is he like this with everyone else, too - or do you think it' s just directed at you? EOS 1 0 7 i think its directed to me. EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Can you give an example and then maybe we can replay it a different way? EOS 1 0 9 if am asked to complete a task, i do complete them and make sure no mistake was made, if he will evaluate the task he always sees fault in what i do. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hmm= that is frustrating. Can you sit with him and go over each section that he finds fault with and ask how he would have done it? EOS 1 0 11 he never give time to listen. i think i' ll quit the job. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe talk to his secretary and make an appointment with him. don' t quit the job unless you have another one lined up..
3 0 0 Hi, how are you today? I feel really sad all the time. I don' t know why. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] hello. you feel sad, why? EOS 3 0 2 I' m not sure. I can' t find a reason. My health is fine. I have friends. I have a place to live. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] your health is fine and you have place to live but you are still sad. EOS 3 0 4 Yes, that' s right. I feel like my life is not going in the right direction. In fact, I' m not going anywhere. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] have you talked to anyone about it. EOS 3 0 6 No, not really. I don' t know what to talk about. I just feel flat. Something' s wrong. I don' t know what. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i have felt that way before but i came over it. EOS 3 0 8 How did you do that? I really need some guidance here. What do I do? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] it came to me like a mood swing for so many days but i started going to meet friends and get closer to my friends for positive vibes. EOS 3 0 10 You met with your friends? I' ve tried meeting with my friends. I feel ok when I' m with them, but then later, I feel sad again. I can' t spend all my time with my friends, of course. They have things to do. So do I. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, you have to be positive at all time and always do something that makes you happy. EOS 3 0 12 I' m trying to be positive. It doesn' t seem to work. I don' t know how to change my mood without chemicals. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you try yoga or meditating as a therapy. EOS 3 0 14 No, I haven' t tried yoga. I thought it was for women. Therapy? You mean like a shrink? EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yoga is not only for women, and yes therapy like a shrink but you don' t have to talk to anybody if you do yoga or meditating. EOS 3 0 16 Oh, meditating by myself? I would need someone to help me learn. Is yoga expensive? I don' t have much money. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yoga is not expensive and meditation doesn' t have to be with anyone, you can use YouTube video as your tutor. It has work for soo many people including my self. EOS 3 0 18 Ok. I' ll check out YouTube. Do I need special clothes or equipment? Or incense or candles or lotoins or something? I' m just a regular guy. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, you have to be in a bright environment. just on the light.
7 0 0 Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well. EOS 7 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well I can help you study if you' d like? EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material... EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study! EOS 7 0 4 My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted. EOS 7 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version. EOS 7 0 6 Wow, that' s actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me. EOS 7 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot. EOS 7 0 8 That is true. I will reach out to her now. EOS 7 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will do just fine, you can do it! EOS 7 0 10 I still have some self - doubt given that I have failed an exam in the past... EOS 7 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam. EOS 7 0 12 I really appreciate this advice. I am feeling better about the exam and feel like I should envision myself passing and doing well. EOS 7 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, thats the spirit it works for me! EOS 7 0 14 I will give it a try! EOS 7 1 15 [Question] Okay is there anything else I can help you with or should I let you go? EOS 7 0 16 No, I should go study now. thank you for your help. EOS 7 1 17 [Others] Of course anytime, have a goodnight! EOS 7 0 18 You too! Wait! I have another concern. EOS 7 1 19 [Question] Yes, what is that? EOS 7 0 20 Do you have any tips for staying cool under pressure while I am taking my exam? EOS 7 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I do actually. First make sure you get a good nights sleep so your brain can rest and function at its best. Next get to class a little early so you have time to soak up the energy in the room and you get a sense of your surroundings. Take it easy and do not rush. Just one question at a time, next thing you know its over. EOS 7 0 22 That is great advice. I will certainly try and get a good night of rest. EOS 7 1 23 [Question] Great anything else? EOS 7 0 24 Nope:) EOS 7 1 25 [Greeting] Okay it has been nice chatting with you, feel free to end the chat now, goodbye.
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 3 0 2 Not feeling good. Trying to find a job but no success. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] It' s a really hard time to be finding new work isn' t it? Are you getting unemployment or anything? EOS 3 0 4 I am getting unemployment but that is not sufficient with 6 children. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wow that' s a lot of kids. Do you know that there are foodbanks out there which might be able to help you? EOS 3 0 6 As a single mother It' s pretty hard to go to search for food bank. I am spending most of my time in looking for a job. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are there any organisations that you could just call and explain your predicament to? EOS 3 0 8 I don' t know any as I never faced such situation before and my partner was there to support the family. Now there is no support of him. life is becoming misearable. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Do you have friends who could help you, even with child care? EOS 3 0 10 One of my friends was really helpful. She moved to different city last month. After that I am totally shattered. EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine that that must have been traumatic. You will make new friends though. EOS 3 0 12 Life is becoming hard day by day. I am feeling guilty that I can' t feed my kids well. No one wants to do friendship with poor people. EOS 3 1 13 [Greeting] I am a poor person too and I' d be happy to be your friend. We have to stick together! EOS 3 0 14 Thank you so much for all your support. You will be a great person for sure. I would like to be your friend but I have nothing to return. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] No need to return anything but friendship. Thanks for talking! EOS 3 0 16 I would try to search near by food bank or NGOs as you suggested. Thank you so much for all you help. EOS 3 1 17 [Self-disclosure] No problem at all... I' ve been there:(( genuinely, not just for the HIT)
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how is your day today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. Not so good. I lost my cat recently. It surely feels... overwhelming at times. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] That is a very hard thing to be going through where you very close to your cat?
3 0 0 I' m so depressed, I just got layed off. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I am sorry to hear that, did you apply for unemployment benefit? That at least can help you financially until you get a new job. EOS 3 0 2 Yes, it will take weeks and the holidays are just around the corner. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sucks it happens so close to the holidays. I understand it' s hard to accept but I' d recommend talking with someone close to you like a friend and family member.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi my name is Sarah, how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hi, Sarah. I am at my wits end. I feel like I am going crazy. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That sounds stressful. What' s happening? EOS 0 0 3 I am stressed out about having to move and I just can' t seem to calm down when it is time to sleep.. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Moving is such a stressful time. When do you move?. EOS 0 0 5 I am moving in a month, but there is just so much to do before then. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. What is your wind - down routine like in the evening, if you have one? EOS 0 0 7 I usually put my kids to bed and then try to relax for about an hour while I watch tv before I head to bed. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Oh you' re a parent AND you are moving, you have a lot on your plate! EOS 0 0 9 Yes, I am a homeschooling mother of two.. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried a warm bath before bed? that' s helped me before. Meditation to still my mind before sleeping helps too. I' ve read that a small carb snack before bed, like a peice of toast, is supposed to help us fall asleep, I haven' t tried it though. EOS 0 0 11 A bath does sound really relaxing. I have tried some meditations. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One thing I highly recommend is a podcast called" Tracks to Relax". EOS 0 0 13 Thanks, I will have to try that. Music does tend to calm me down. I don' t know why I haven' t tried that. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It' s guided sleep meditations, and his voice is incredibly soothing.... works well for me on nights I can' t naturally fall asleep. He leads you relaxing walks into the forest and such things, it' s very peaceful.
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic? EOS 0 0 16 so literally, I only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. I only started a new work in September, and it' s not much( about two days a week), so I can' t comment too much about that. It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps. EOS 0 0 18 so I get nervous in general when I am at work but I do my work just the same. May not be able to work as well because I have to breathe through a mask, and some other small difficulties. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is good that you can continue to do your work the same. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you for all the positive messages so far and in understanding and sympathizing with me.. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] Is there anything else I should know about how the pandemic is affecting you? EOS 0 0 22 pretty much. If anything, it' s my academic life at home that has changed not so well.. EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Are you a student? EOS 0 0 24 yes, I take online courses and I tend to procrastinate a lot more and get distracted as I find myself more and more at home. Just getting carried away and now have impending deadlines.. I can get through it but it has had a toll on my productivity.. I was just taking my sweet time with it and that wasn' t good. EOS 0 1 25 [Self-disclosure] I am also a student and am not motivated to do school work at home, so I completely understand. I am sure you are successful at school! Having a planner may keep you organized and on - task. Dedicating a certain time frame and area for school work might help, as well.. EOS 0 0 26 Because prior to the pandemic, I was pretty regimented with set schedules and can clear my mind with work - outs and going to the gym and movies, but now it' s not that simple.. EOS 0 1 27 [Question] Is there anything else I can help you with? EOS 0 0 28 Thank you and I hope your schooling goes well also.. EOS 0 1 29 [Greeting] Thank you, you too! EOS 0 0 30 yeah I like your idea of dedicating the time. I find that I am slacking off and being disorganized in areas like time management. So yes I have to improve on that.. I suppose you have been doing your schooling relatively better in your situation?. I hope you do anyhow. EOS 0 1 31 [Question] Great ideas! Is there anything else I can help you with? EOS 0 0 32 would you have any other advice on how to overcome things like time management with academics? like how to avoid procrastination? Because this was so much better in the past that I just had set schedules and can clear my mind by going out, etc.. and feeling refreshed and feeling the urgency to study again.. But that' s gone for me now.. EOS 0 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would reccomend setting deadlines in your planner of when tasks need to be completed and also setting timers for 20 minutes at a time where you have to focus for that long before you can do any other task. EOS 0 0 34 Great, I think that' s a good area for me to go into.. Timers and set agendas. EOS 0 1 35 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes! EOS 0 0 36 like a timetable when they used to hand out when I used to be in high school, let' s say. and this hour I do this, etc.. and as you say, yoga or work out in between. all great ideas I think. EOS 0 1 37 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, excellent! EOS 0 0 38 thank you for that.. ok then. I think I am set now to get back to my studies then with a refreshed mind.. EOS 0 1 39 [Greeting] You are so welcome. Have a great day! EOS 0 0 40 Thank you for all your help. You as well and I hope your studies and work go well.. have a great day also. EOS 0 1 41 [Greeting] Thank you! Talk to you later.
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? EOS 1 0 22 He' s a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly. EOS 1 0 24 But maybe I deserved it. EOS 1 1 25 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly. EOS 1 0 26 Yes, he did. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No you did not! Please don' t think like that. EOS 1 0 28 I' m just so angry that I could break something. And maybe I will do that! EOS 1 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this. EOS 1 0 30 But what if it doesn' t pass? And I cannot afford therapy. EOS 1 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now. There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free. EOS 1 0 32 I don' t know if I could do that. I don' t like talking about my problems with strangers. EOS 1 1 33 [Self-disclosure] And yet here we are: P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found.. I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that I was. EOS 1 0 34 Do you have any suggestions about how to open up to people I don' t know? EOS 1 1 35 [Others] I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No - one will be judging you. EOS 1 0 36 That' s what I am afraid of. Being judged by people. EOS 1 1 37 [Question] Do you think that this might partly because your ex has eroded your self esteem?. EOS 1 0 38 Probably. He called me a lot of names. EOS 1 1 39 [Others] The important thing is to gradually rebuild your self esteem. Do you have any things that you excel at?.
0 1 0 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hello, How are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 am fine. at least for now. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] would you like to talk about it?
4 0 0 I' m feeling really sad, I thought it was going somewhere. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What do you mean you thought it was going somewhere? Are you okay? EOS 4 0 2 yes I' m okay, I' m so sad. five years, I gave my heart to this girl. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Did you guys break up recently? EOS 4 0 4 yes she broke my heart last night, what did I do wrong? EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong. You shouldn' t blame yourself. EOS 4 0 6 but I gave her my all. I feel so betrayed. I' m feeling so sad I want to jump over a bridge. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there, a few years before I was married, my boyfriend broke up with me. We had some space, and then were able to become friends again. And you know what? We ended up getting back together and getting married. EOS 4 0 8 you think it' s my fault? 5 years man, 5 years and just like that she broke my heart. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t give up, you never know what the future holds. I don' t know your particular situation, but it takes two to make relationships work. I don' t think you should blame yourself. EOS 4 0 10 thank you, will try to keep my head up. you think she cheated on me? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] I don' t know what happened. Is that what you think happened?

There are so many people going through this right now. EOS 2 0 2 Yes and that worries me even more. More people competing for the same jobs.( 2) EOS 2 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a fare worry but you can' t be discourged. YOu need to think positively.

It' s been awhile.( 3) EOS 2 1 5 [Question] That' s a good activity!! Do you have anyone who can help you with it?

You can try virtual connections. EOS 2 0 10 Yes, but I know I' ll also have a lot of work to do to get ready to find a new job. I' m really hoping I can find one before I lose this one( 6) EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] HAve you been searching online sites? They post so many nowadays!

EOS 2 0 3 Yeah that' s true. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] whats been the weirdest part of the pandemic for you? EOS 2 0 5 So I live with my boyfriend and my bestfriend. And I am afraid they are doing skethy stuff behind my back. It sounds crazy, and I don' t have any proof but I have this feeling. The way they talk around each other makes me nervous. EOS 2 1 6 [Question] hmm, tell me more. what do you think is going on? EOS 2 0 7 I' m scared when it is just the two of them here at home. And they are jsut so much more friendly together than before we moved in. EOS 2 1 8 [Question] living together can make people more comfortable with each other. has there been something specific that has caused you to wonder about them> EOS 2 0 9 Not really specifics. It' s more of a just in general sort of thing. I know them both really really well, so I am just picking up on tiny little details. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] i hear you. have you said anything to either one of them? EOS 2 0 11 I have talked to my boyfriend, but he just tells me that it' s crazy I would think something like that. Idk... I don' t want to sound crazy and blow it out of proportion if it' s really nothing. I don' t know if there is actually something I should be worried about, or if I am thinking these crazy thoughts for other reasons. EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] having doubts about relationships is rough. do you know brene brown? EOS 2 0 13 I don' t know who that is. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she researches shame and vunerability. EOS 2 0 15 Does she do live talks or videos? Or is she more in online writing. EOS 2 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she has a great TED talk! EOS 2 0 17 Oh that' s cool! I will have to check that out. So you think maybe I am feeling this way is because I have shame or vulnerability in the relationship? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] anyway, i find her imspirational when I have doubts. no, not really it' s the doubting that is likely what' s bothering you the most - the unknown.
5 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. I' m here to listen. EOS 5 0 1 The unemployment office is overwhelmed and I' m overwhelmed trying to help my family member. EOS 5 1 2 [Providing Suggestions or Information] These days all of us have this situation. I can assure you that your family can understand it. How about an online job? EOS 5 0 3 Yes, it just very frustrating. My family member has taken another restaurant job only to lose it again for the same reasons, COVID. They have been going to temp services also. EOS 5 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I also worked in a coffee house and it has been closed for this damn virus. I feel sad too. But we should go on.
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 6 0 1 hi. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing? EOS 6 0 3 Well I' m distraught. EOS 6 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel that way? EOS 6 0 5 Because my girlfriend has left me. EOS 6 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard for you. I haven' t personally had to deal with that, but I have had friends that have. How long were you together? EOS 6 0 7 four years. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being together that long must have made that break up difficult. How are you coping with it? EOS 6 0 9 well I' m not really, especially as she' d gone off with someone else. But I' m to blame which makes it worse. EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened? EOS 6 0 11 I cheated on her on a drunken night. It was a one - off and I regret it terribly. But she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain. EOS 6 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I see how she would be upset. It must be difficult for you though because she didn' t give you another chance. Do you have someone to talk to about your feelings? EOS 6 0 13 yeah, I' m not saying I deserved it just wish she had. But no, not really. No - one who would understand. EOS 6 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I would have wanted a second chance too if I were in your shoes. Is this affecting you really bad? EOS 6 0 15 Yeah I feel so low. EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If your mood is affecting your daily activities, normally that means your mental health has been affected. You could always talk to a professional if it' s hard for you. EOS 6 0 17 it' s difficult though, to open up. EOS 6 1 18 [Self-disclosure] It is. But trust me, it really helps. I' ve been seeing a therapist recently actually and I love it. I don' t have to worry about judgement at all. It' s a hard step but worth it in the end. EOS 6 0 19 They won' t think I' m to blame? EOS 6 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The job of the therapist isn' t to figure out if what you did was wrong or right. It' s to help you understand your feelings and better cope. That' s why they are so great! EOS 6 0 21 oh yeah, that' s a good point. EOS 6 1 22 [Question] Would you like to talk anything else through?
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation.

EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck. EOS 0 0 7 How did you push past that job? EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work. EOS 0 0 9 Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career? EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too. EOS 0 0 11 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Can you give me some more details? EOS 0 0 13 I just find the work mundane and way too remedial. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable. EOS 0 0 15 did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job? EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have you a few, there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit. EOS 0 0 17 what types of skill can I gain online? EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Indeed is one of the better ones to look for jobs, honestly I would suggest looking at jobs that you normally wouldn' t and see what kind of qualifications they need and see if you can get that done online. EOS 0 0 19 so filter based on my absolute needs and go for online skills that I can complete? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes I think that is a great idea, look for jobs that meet your needs and figure out what you can do to look attractive to employers. EOS 0 0 21 I have tried glassdoor before, have you had any luck there? EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used it a bit, I mainly used indeed. EOS 0 0 23 and have you showcased your skills using LinkedIn before? I have had that one recommended to me before, they said its a great way to neatly organize accomplishments and personal background. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes especially if you are applying for anything in a professional setting that is very important. EOS 0 0 25 do you have any examples of online skills you completed? EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] coursera has a lot of great courses, it really depends on what you are looking for. EOS 0 0 27 if I was looking to enter the engineering field, any recommendations? EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Is that what you are going to school for? EOS 0 0 29 yes but I may change my mind. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] What year are you in? most engineering programs have a practicum and that is a great opportunity to make contacts and potentially get offered a job. EOS 0 0 31 yes I have been networking as I go. EOS 0 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly you seem like you are pretty on top of this I don' t think you will have any issues finding a job. EOS 0 0 33 yeah I mean the topic was about final exam stress but we got on a tangent. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Yes that is fair enough, how much time do you have until your exam? EOS 0 0 35 15 minutes. EOS 0 1 36 [Affirmation and Reassurance] While that is plenty of time to get some studying done:) EOS 0 0 37 yes I probably should, thank you for your insight! EOS 0 1 38 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Honestly I find that if you are going for the test right away I always like to just breath and relax a bit.

EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I' m very sorry to hear you' re going through that..
4 1 0 [Question] how are yo. EOS 4 0 1 Good how are you. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] ok. thanks for asking. what on your mind. EOS 4 0 3 Just been having a rough time.... recently broke up with my girlfriend. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] sounds hard. are you doing anything to help. EOS 4 0 5 Trying to avoid thoughts about her, but every where on social media she is posting about her new guy. It is hard to escape the sadness. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow. in our connected world it is hard to get away. do you want to tell me how it happened. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah it is. Well we have been having trouble staying closely connected since the lockdown. We tried to make time for one another, but it has been tough. I was the one who broke things off because I know longer felt much love coming from her. I felt neglected and I thought a break up was the best solution. I did not think she would pick up a new guy two weeks later. I was not prepared to deal with this kind of pain and it hurts. EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It was wise of you to know your feeling towards the relationship and make a mature decision for the both of you. During this pandemic too. that must have been even harder.. EOS 4 0 9 Yeah it has been difficult and I know I will make it through. It is just difficult to get through break ups these days. Unless you disconnect you can' t avoid the other person. EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] that' s a good idea. Have you thought about disconnecting?

EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now. EOS 3 0 10 Yes and a lot of uncetainty. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Most definitely, I' ve also been feeling a bit overwhelmed by what' s going on. How have you been coping? EOS 3 0 12 It' s good to know others feel the way I do. I' ve been trying to keep busy and not watch the news too much. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a good strategy, all the news outlets can be very overwhelming. EOS 3 0 14 Yes with lots of conflicting information. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] What do you like to do to keep busy? EOS 3 0 16 Work, read, exercise. I' ve been going to the gym more. EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Those sound like really good coping skills. EOS 3 0 18 Thank you. I' m trying. I really don' t want to be on medication. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a personal choice you' re completely allowed to make. It sounds like you have a good foundation for building on your ability to cope. EOS 3 0 20 I am trying. I don' t want to fall deep down an emotional black hole. EOS 3 1 21 [Question] Understandable. Do you talk with a therapist or have someone you trust you like to talk to? EOS 3 0 22 Yes, my husband is very supportive but I don' t want to upset him too much so I don' t fully open up. EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s great he is supportive. Seeing an individual counselor or someone of the like can also be helpful. They' re there for just you and they have unbiased opinions. A lot are doing telehealth right now.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello. EOS 2 0 1 Hello I am in need of assistance. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] I am Tom. How can I help you? How are you in need of assistance? EOS 2 0 3 Hello Tom, this is Dillon.. I haven' t been doing well in my academics. EOS 2 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I have a real talent to provide guidance to people out there in the World. Not doing well in college or high school? Are you in a trade school? Or in academia? EOS 2 0 5 In college. I started off really well until the pandemic hit. Now my family is struggling financially and it has greatly affected my academics.

2 1 0 [Question] Hello, how may i help you today? EOS 2 0 1 hi. I am not sure I offended my close friend, I' m scared, he will see pictures of the car I bought for my wife today on my status. actually, I have initial plan to get the a as a birthday gift for my wife before he came to ask for the money. EOS 2 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so you are scared your friend will get mad at you for buying your wife a car after he came asking for money from you? is that correct? EOS 2 0 3 I don' t know how to explain the matter, why I can' t borrow him the money. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] Have you talked to him recently?
0 0 0 Hello. Feeling low today. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it. EOS 0 0 2 I' ve been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn' t go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint? EOS 0 0 4 Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don' t have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions. EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that? EOS 0 0 21 being on the board gives me perks. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit? EOS 0 0 23 yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there' s an element of mutual manipulation. EOS 0 0 25 yes. EOS 0 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are definitely not the only person to feel this way! EOS 0 0 27 it' s a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power.. what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board. EOS 0 0 29 i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment. EOS 0 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] But that is rather manipulative of you. EOS 0 0 31 if you were me you would forget about him and the board. EOS 0 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I definitely would do that. EOS 0 0 33 thing is he is encouraging me to be like that. cuz it helps him too. okay. i' ll try to lay low and walk away from it. EOS 0 1 34 [Others] I think it' s time for a clear severance. Do you have any other people you are interested in? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 35 yes but it' s less than before cuz of Covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this - if that makes sense. EOS 0 1 36 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah I hear you. You feel that your options are rather more limited than previously because of the lockdown? EOS 0 0 37 yes. EOS 0 1 38 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is something I believe that most of us are feeling right now so I sympathise. EOS 0 0 39 true. i just have to be strong about it with him. even if he likes me i don' t think it' s a healthy relationship. i slept with one of his friends and the other one wanted to sleep with me too. EOS 0 1 40 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be. Is he aware that this happened?
4 0 0 I feel sad, and feel like need help. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you identify why you feel sad? EOS 4 0 2 yes, my aunt pass away a couple weeks ago. and since then im feeling really sad. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is natural to feel sad when someone you care about dies.
4 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 4 0 2 I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age? EOS 4 0 4 He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough, both for you and him. I know it' s meaningless to tell you not to be sad, however, you can think that he' s not in a better place.
4 1 0 [Question] What is going on today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling really down about my breakup. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] \ So you have had a breakup recently and you are feeling down about it. EOS 4 0 3 Yes. I thought that it wouldn' t be terrible because I initiated it but now I regret it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] So are you doubting that you made the right decision or are you just feeling sadness at the loss you are feeling right now. EOS 4 0 5 I' m mainly doubting my decision and I know there' s nothing I can do about it. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You must have had good reason' s to have made the decision to breakup and to have initiated it. Its normal to doubt yourself afterwards. You may want to remind yourself of the reasons that you came to your decision you did. Im sure the reasons are still valid. EOS 4 0 7 I did it because I' m trying to focus on self - improvement but looking back now, there' s no reason I couldn' t have improved myself with my partner. EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up. In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single.. EOS 4 0 9 That' s what I hope for. I just can' t get over missing my partner because they were great to me, I just needed to be alone. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think you are feeling a loss even though you feel that at this time you need to be alone to focus on your own growth. When you had the conversation about this breakup were you honest about why you need the space and that your problem was not with the relationship but with maybe the timing. I think with communication and after growth perhaps by keeping the door open with this person maybe you can have some sort of relationship in the future even if its friendship or maybe more. You are doing what is right for yourself at the given time. EOS 4 0 11 I did get the chance to explain my reasons a few days after the breakup. We were friendly and talked casually for a few more days and then they said they needed to space to get themselves together. We haven' t really talked since then. The problem is I' m open to something in the future but I don' t know that they are and I can' t find the courage to ask. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have been in both situations before the one who needed space and also as the one who was broken up with. I think right now the best thing you can do for you and the person is to stick with your decision and give them time they also may need space to process and deal with the breakup and growth for themselves without really letting go you won' t be able to grow in time you can have a conversation and ask but it might be six months down the road wait for them to come to you they have asked for time as you did too soon.

EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel.

EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all. EOS 0 0 45 Also being far away from him sucks. EOS 0 1 46 [Question] Are you guys FaceTiming or communicating at all other than by texts? EOS 0 0 47 You are being very helpful by the way thank you. We aren' t FaceTiming. I just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it.. EOS 0 1 48 [Greeting] I' m trying my best, thank you for the input! Upset about leaving the apartment? Or was there something else that happened that weekend? EOS 0 0 49 Just leaving him. EOS 0 1 50 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you guys thought about scheduling date nights through FaceTime? EOS 0 0 51 I think he would but he hasn' t been feeling really good about his appearance lately. I asked and that' s what he told me. EOS 0 1 52 [Self-disclosure] I understand that completely, I can relate a lot. EOS 0 0 53 Same. EOS 0 1 54 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If it makes any difference, my partner and I have been doing date nights where we would dress up, put make up on and do our hair and everything as if we were going to the restaurant, and even if it is through Facetime or whenever we see each other in real life, it helps not only with our own self - esteem but also our relationship. EOS 0 0 55 That is very cute. EOS 0 1 56 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could open the discussion with your boyfriend, tell him that you have a date planned over Facetime and you want him to order his favorite dinner, take a shower, do his hair and dress up real nice. EOS 0 0 57 I don' t know if he would be open to that but I could try. He isn' t really the romantic type. EOS 0 1 58 [Question] You have been friends for a long time before getting together, you guys are comfortable with each other, right? EOS 0 0 59 Yes. EOS 0 1 60 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay well you do know him more than I do haha, so what would be his ideal date night? EOS 0 0 61 Probably just being at home. EOS 0 1 62 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hm okay, well I' m sure that if you do propose and organize something for him, even if it is not his favorite thing to do, if he sees that it would make you happy, he will at least consider it don' t you think? EOS 0 0 63 Yeah probably. Things are hard right now though. EOS 0 1 64 [Question] In other ways than financially?
0 0 0 Hello? Is anyone there? Is anyone there. HELLO? no one is supporting me here..:: twiddles thumbs:: the instructions for the support seeker are incorrect as there is no button that has shown for" the partner' s reasons".. the supporter did not respond. This test is skewed. No one is here to chat with. even after being matched. Ridiculous. hello????? hello? no other messages except my own are showing up. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Sorry, I had a bad connection. Hello, what can I help you with? EOS 0 0 2 Hi. i wasn' t sure anyone was there. i left my job about three months after 8 years.. haven' t found another one.. trying to find one has been challenging. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Just be clear, you' re worried about finding a new job?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that? EOS 0 0 21 being on the board gives me perks. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit? EOS 0 0 23 yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there' s an element of mutual manipulation. EOS 0 0 25 yes. EOS 0 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are definitely not the only person to feel this way! EOS 0 0 27 it' s a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power.. what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board. EOS 0 0 29 i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment. EOS 0 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] But that is rather manipulative of you. EOS 0 0 31 if you were me you would forget about him and the board. EOS 0 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I definitely would do that.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 hi. Could you please help?. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How are you tonight?. EOS 3 0 3 I am okay. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 3 0 5 I caught my gf texting another guy. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So from what I understand, you caught your significant other texting someone else.. EOS 3 0 7 yes right. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] What types of things was she texting him about? EOS 3 0 9 Asking about what he was doing later. What he likes to do for fun. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Just from the few messages we have sent, I can tell you are very anxious and upset about this situation.. EOS 3 0 11 yes for sure, i was so shocked and disappointed. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand this as I had issues with my ex fiancé texting other guys and cheating on me.. EOS 3 0 13 Oh no! thats horrible too. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how hard a situation like this is, but I know you can get through it! EOS 3 0 15 Thanks so much! I think I can too. Thanks for sharing with me. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to have a conversation with her about it?
3 0 0 Hello. Hello? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hey how are you doing?. EOS 3 0 2 Doing alright, thanks. Yourself? EOS 3 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing fine, thank you.. EOS 3 0 4 Good to hear. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 6 I' ve been feeling very down lately. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] That sounds difficult, Would you like to elaborate on that? EOS 3 0 8 Sure. I feel depressed about the state of the US and of the rest of the world. It' s very overwhelming.. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now. EOS 3 0 10 Yes and a lot of uncetainty. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Most definitely, I' ve also been feeling a bit overwhelmed by what' s going on. How have you been coping? EOS 3 0 12 It' s good to know others feel the way I do. I' ve been trying to keep busy and not watch the news too much. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a good strategy, all the news outlets can be very overwhelming. EOS 3 0 14 Yes with lots of conflicting information. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] What do you like to do to keep busy? EOS 3 0 16 Work, read, exercise. I' ve been going to the gym more. EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Those sound like really good coping skills. EOS 3 0 18 Thank you. I' m trying. I really don' t want to be on medication. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a personal choice you' re completely allowed to make. It sounds like you have a good foundation for building on your ability to cope. EOS 3 0 20 I am trying. I don' t want to fall deep down an emotional black hole. EOS 3 1 21 [Question] Understandable. Do you talk with a therapist or have someone you trust you like to talk to?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there! What would you like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 1 I am trying to be fine and you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] It may be helpful to know.. my name is Ann. I am 43 years old... and I know for myself, I enjoy talking to people when I have concerns. What is going on? EOS 0 0 3 Thank you for your concern, I am just worried. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What has you worried? I know right now... its a hard time for so many people. I have struggled with my own anxiety the past few weeks. EOS 0 0 5 Sorry about that. This is about my relationship. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah.... relationship worries can be so draining and emotionally exhausting. I can understand that. In your relationship, what has happened to create your worries? EOS 0 0 7 I trusted my spouse but eventually disappointed. She got a jot in another town and she utilize the opportunity to be sleeping around. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine how a break in trust has made you feel. I know a break in trust is always very difficult to process. EOS 0 0 9 I am planing to get married next year but things has changed now. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Oh I am sorry to hear that. Have you had a conversation with her about her actions and how they have made you feel? EOS 0 0 11 She knew pretty well how I felt. I don' t want to have anything to do with her again. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel that her actions and result can be remedied? Or is this such a fundamental break that you cannot reconcile? EOS 0 0 13 I just want to move on with my life. EOS 0 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Understandable. I would feel similar, in truth.
2 0 0 how can i find a jobs in my area. What kind of jobs open right now. EOS 2 1 1 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried the classified ads? Or check on facebook for a jobs page in your area? EOS 2 0 2 No. EOS 2 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest starting with one of those options.. do you have a resume? EOS 2 0 4 I don' t have resume. EOS 2 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest you type one up, most employers want an application and a resume. EOS 2 0 6 I will need somebody type one for me. EOS 2 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps a friend can help you, if not they have programs on the web to help assist with that.
0 0 0 I am really feeling the loneliness of the season and being isolated. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Good evening.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I' m a little bummed because my friend is not only a junkie but he got arrested last week. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ouch! Your friend got arrested for drugs last week? EOS 3 0 3 He got arrested for stealing to fund his addiction. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I had a neighbor who was doing meth, and he got arrested, and that actually saved his life. He had to get sober and look at what he was doing. There is a hard line between helping a friend who is addicted and actually enabling them. Have you ever heard of this? EOS 3 0 5 Sadly my friend has been arrested a few times, spent time in prison, and is fully locked in his lifestyle. He' s such a great person, very funny, nice, but he is lost. EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It can be very hard to watch a loved one destroy their lives. Has anyone every discussed an intervention?
3 0 0 Hello, I' ve been really depressed lately and feel like there isn' t anything I can do to break this feeling. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened? EOS 3 0 2 November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS( its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 4 Yes that is correct. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest. EOS 3 0 6 I know I' m not alone and that' s what makes it hard to reach out, because I don' t want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there' s. It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do. It seems that you don' t want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person. EOS 3 0 8 I just don' t know what to do about it anymore. Yes, I don' t like to bother others or let other people down. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure. Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief? Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think? EOS 3 0 10 It is a lot, I' m used to being the person that everyone comes to for help, but I am not very good at asking for help myself. I have seen a doctor and they started my new medicine regimen but unfortunately there is no cure for this disease. I was going to physical therapy but finished that right as Covid started.. Plus it does get better as the weather gets warmer so the winter has been hard, really looking forward to spring and summer for a little relief. EOS 3 1 11 [Others] I' m sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now. EOS 3 0 12 I' d be open to doing Yoga once things open back up, but having this disease puts me in a high risk category so my interaction outside the home still has to remain limited until we develop some heard immunity. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know. Sunshine is always best cure for a better mood. Did you try to maybe walk or drive around your neighborhood for some fresh air? Oh, then drive around might be the only option.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues.

4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one. EOS 4 0 16 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. What else can I do besides meditation? EOS 4 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds? EOS 4 0 18 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. Candles are much better for me. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil. EOS 4 0 20 I haven' t heard of that website before. I' ll have to check it out. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships.

EOS 0 0 13 No, I haven' t. I thought it wouldn' t be the same as really hanging out. I don' t drink. I do like to play board games though. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It will not be same.. but better than being alone.. EOS 0 0 15 That' s true. I wanted to play board games online with some friends, but they weren' t interested. It' s not the same thing to play with strangers.

EOS 6 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient. EOS 6 0 18 Yes I know. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried to go to place and talk to a hiring boss about a job? EOS 6 0 20 It' s hard with this virus to go anywhere pretty much. EOS 6 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] yes i can understand that. EOS 6 0 22 Worst time to graduate. Haven' t even got the graduation ceremony lol. EOS 6 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] all you can honestly really do right now is to try to improve your resume and see if that helps any and just keep searching for jobs and putting in applications and i know you will get a call from a job soon. yes it has been a bad year for anything to happen.

7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed!

EOS 3 0 4 I am getting unemployment but that is not sufficient with 6 children. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wow that' s a lot of kids. Do you know that there are foodbanks out there which might be able to help you? EOS 3 0 6 As a single mother It' s pretty hard to go to search for food bank. I am spending most of my time in looking for a job. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are there any organisations that you could just call and explain your predicament to? EOS 3 0 8 I don' t know any as I never faced such situation before and my partner was there to support the family. Now there is no support of him. life is becoming misearable. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Do you have friends who could help you, even with child care? EOS 3 0 10 One of my friends was really helpful. She moved to different city last month. After that I am totally shattered. EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine that that must have been traumatic. You will make new friends though.

Do you work for anyone or just in general. EOS 3 0 8 mostly sights that talk about movies. there are a few i submit to. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Good. I write on a forum called Medium. I write and can get paid also. EOS 3 0 10 oh yes i know that one. EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There are various topics you can write about. Just write and post. Are you a copywriter. EOS 3 0 12 that is cool. a good way to discover other writers as well. I wish, that would be good money. i' m horrible at doing things for others, I need people to pay me to do my thing.. EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I read different postings and have over 30 followers. EOS 3 0 14 awesome, good for you.

4 1 0 [Question] Hello there, can I help you with any today?* anything. I am happy to talk to you about any problem that you might be having? EOS 4 0 1 I am having such a difficult time today!!! EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you. EOS 4 0 3 I think that my boyfriend is cheating on me again!!! EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Are you saying that he has cheated on you before? That does not sound very promising. EOS 4 0 5 He has but it was a long time ago and was before we had a talk about exclusivity in our relationship but it still hurt. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Have you considered getting some sort of couples counselling? Or do you just think that he is never going to change? EOS 4 0 7 We tried counselling once.. It was online and we got paid to do it.. I don' t think he took it seriously at the time. He always said he felt like he was being attacked. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. So you feel that he is not really taking your problems as a couple seriously? EOS 4 0 9 Yes. I feel he thinks of me as some sort of trophy and he does not have to work now that he won me over in the first place. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have been in toxic relationships before and to be honest it does sound a little as though this is one of those situations. EOS 4 0 11 I have been as well but this time was supposed to be different. At first everything was great but now things are so distant I just don' t know what to do next. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you feel that perhaps it might be time to move on? People who will cheat twice are pretty unlikely to ever change their ways. EOS 4 0 13 That is true. But now we have a kid together and I feel like it would break her heart to lose her dad. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah you did not mention that! Maybe for the sake of your child it might be worth going to counselling again then. EOS 4 0 15 Maybe but a place that we won' t get paid to go... I think he thought of it as a job or something. I got a lot out of the experience and still use the skills to this day. But with a unresponsive partner those skills will not work.. Can you recomend a good site to find affordable services? EOS 4 1 16 [Question] You could ask your doctor to recommend something that will not cost you too much but will be effective?
4 0 0 hi. hello!!??!!?? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] hello. EOS 4 0 2 hi. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I apologize I was having a sneezing fit! What is on your mind today? EOS 4 0 4 oh no. i hope its not covid!. my friends aunt is in the hospital with double pneumonia from covid. EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] No, cats and out of claritin. oh my, that is horrible! EOS 4 0 6 i hear ya. just bought some claritin this morning for allergies. I agree. at least she is responding to the treatments in the hospital. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That' s great to hear she is responding! EOS 4 0 8 I was happy to hear it too. I' ve been extra careful not to get it cuz of my parents. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] ah, are they elderly or have a weakened immune system?
5 1 0 [Question] Hi there. How are you today? EOS 5 0 1 I' m good. how r u? EOS 5 1 2 [Question] I' m doing good today. What brings you on here? EOS 5 0 3 I' m not happy with an ex friend who talks behind my back to my current friends. EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] ugh. There' s nothing worse than that. Have you confronted the ex friend?
6 0 0 Hello, how are you?. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 6 0 2 I' m alright, honestly I' m feeling rather ashamed. The reason for that and the problem that I' m facing is that I' ve had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and I' m only 24 years old. Right now in my life I' m ready to seek help, but I' m having a lot of anxiety about it because I' m very worried about how others will judge me. I' m worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that I will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. I' m ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that I' ve made that have gotten me here and I guess my problem is that I just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that I can just finally make the step that I need so desperately and get help. EOS 6 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am in a good position to help you as I am in the same situation. Please know you are not alone. I would definitely recommend seeking help sooner rather than later! Hello? Are you wanting to talk? EOS 6 0 4 Yes of course I didn' t hear it go off, my apologies. I really appreciate that, it really is helpful knowing that I' m not the only one who feels this way. I really know that that' s what I need to do, and I am trying my best to get over my fears and just do it ya know. EOS 6 1 5 [Question] What level of alcohol consumption do you have? EOS 6 0 6 no matter how hard it seems, maybe it wont be when I actual do it. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Trust me everyone will be very sympathetic:). Everyone there will be in the same place. And the longer you keep drinking the more damage you are doing to yourself. EOS 6 0 8 and quite a bit, about half a gallon or more a day. And thank you, I really do appreciate your help. I know that and I know its time for me to better my life because its no way to live ya know. Id like to grow up and have a normal life(:. EOS 6 1 9 [Others] I am not sure how much half a gallon is to you... I am in the UK and I know it differs between the US and UK:)
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Nice to meet you Jim, I am doing well. Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 3 I really appreciate your time Yes. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What is on your mind? EOS 0 0 5 I have been retired for over 2 years and would like to return to the workforce, part - ti me. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are thinking of going back to work? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, It would help us greatly. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have the right idea already. EOS 0 0 9 There are plenty of jobs and not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will find something suitable if you keep trying. EOS 0 0 11 Thanks What do you mean? Yeah, I know this but I don' t feel it.. EOS 0 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] You may feel a little apprehensive to get started. EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, I am. I know I can do it. Not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have been in the same position before and came out successful in the end. EOS 0 0 15 Wow, That' s great. How did you start?. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I just decided. EOS 0 0 17 What gave you the strength to go forward? I have this nervousness about getting rejected.. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing little things every day. EOS 0 0 19 So, keep myself busy and try to ignore my nervousness? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Really adds up and helps to get the big picture moving. EOS 0 0 21 OK, so with, well, kinf0f like baby steps.... right. EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It is about making small adjustments to feed a good habit.
3 0 0 hello. how are you today? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today?. EOS 3 0 2 a bit sad. more depressed. its just i keep getting benched at work. i' m not really sure what do to.* to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset. EOS 3 0 4 i' m not really sure what i' m doing wrong. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though. EOS 3 0 6 what can i do though? EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there' s anything going on? EOS 3 0 8 hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Of course! That sounds frustrating to not know why it' s happening and not have the opportunity to ask. EOS 3 0 10 yes... hrm. that may work. how can i stop being depressed all the time though.. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' ve also had bosses that are infrequently in the office and make getting good information hard. EOS 3 0 12 how did you fix the issue? i work at home and its like just trying to reach out - they are always busy. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren' t always a reflection of us or how we' re performing. EOS 3 0 14 this whole covid thing has me scrambling to talk to a live person. EOS 3 1 15 [Others] I can imagine! EOS 3 0 16 ok, so just keep pushing and getting good work done? EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I was in a physical office when I had this problem, but the boss rotated between offices. It was hard to wait, but I just kept my head down until the next time she was available. That' s what I did. EOS 3 0 18 maybe i can try that. thank you. i' ll give it a shot. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think reminding yourself that if there was a problem with your work they would be seeking YOU out, and not the other way around. EOS 3 0 20 hrm... that' s a good point! i hadn' t thought of it that way. EOS 3 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] Hopefully that mindset can help you stay positive until you have the chance to speak with them, instead of worrying about what you' ve done wrong. That anxiety feels like what is keeping you down?
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, I' m here to listen. What' s going on? EOS 0 0 1 Thank you. I' ve lost my job and I' m very nervous about the future. As a result I am having a hard time sleeping. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Wow, that' s very hard. I would be anxious too. EOS 0 0 3 That makes me feel a lot better. Have you ever lost your job? EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I have. I was laid off. It was nerve - racking, but also really sad. EOS 0 0 5 What helped you get through it? EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I had a bit in savings, but I looked for new jobs mostly. I was on unemployment insurance for about a month before I found a new job. Have you made any plans yet about how to move forward? I can offer some suggestions if you would like. I know about a lot of resources. EOS 0 0 7 I am a gig worker, so I cannot apply for IU. Its very hard, but i also have some savings. What kind of tools would you recommend I use to get through this. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, falling back on savings while you look for more work is good for a while. If you have any food insecurity as a result, there are often local food banks. It' s really not something to be embarrased about, so many people face food insecurity through no fault of their own. You could also give a call to your local social services because they will be able to tell you what resources would be available, whether it' s a vocational program or temporary assistance. EOS 0 0 9 Wow you' re so helpful and encouraging! It' s very nice to talk to you.. Are there any meds you can recommend to help me sleep? EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, if it' s possible, I would talk to a doctor. If you' re looking for Over - the - counter sleep medication, melatonin has helped me in the past. EOS 0 0 11 Wow! I' ve never used melatonin before. Did it really help you? Are you doing much better now? EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] It defiitely helps me fall asleep. It' s a natural sleep aid. If something like that doesn' t work, I would talk to a doctor. I know money will be tight though. Are there any free clinics near you?. EOS 0 0 13 I' ll look into it. There' s a lot of services in the general area that might be able to help me. It' s been really nice talking to you. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Thank you. I hope you' re feeling a bit better. Is there anything else you want to talk about? EOS 0 0 15 No I' m okay. I think that' s everything:) EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Alright, well I hope you have a good night. Good luck, you' ve got this!
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay just anxious. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that' s bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I believe i am going to fail all my finals for college. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] College finals are a stressful time for sure, I' m sure you' re doing your best to prepare. EOS 0 0 6 Yes i have been studying for hours everyday. sometimes it is hard to focus. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s best to take a short break to reset when you feel like your gears are grinding. EOS 0 0 8 that is true, but i feel guilty when i take breaks. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I often feel the same way when I' m not busy doing work. But sometimes you need that little break to get back into the zone and be more productive. EOS 0 0 10 I try to take multiple 5 min breaks throughout my studying but it usually turns into hours breaks lol. its hard to focus. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You sounds pretty stressed about it, make sure you' re getting enough sleep so you don' t get run down. EOS 0 0 12 Yes i. do sleep for at least 10 hours. i also take 20 minute power naps because i have read somewhere it helps. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there someone you could study with to help break up how you' re studying?
3 0 0 Hi, how are you today? I feel really sad all the time. I don' t know why. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] hello. you feel sad, why? EOS 3 0 2 I' m not sure. I can' t find a reason. My health is fine. I have friends. I have a place to live. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] your health is fine and you have place to live but you are still sad. EOS 3 0 4 Yes, that' s right. I feel like my life is not going in the right direction. In fact, I' m not going anywhere. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] have you talked to anyone about it. EOS 3 0 6 No, not really. I don' t know what to talk about. I just feel flat. Something' s wrong. I don' t know what. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i have felt that way before but i came over it.

I' ve tried meeting with my friends. I feel ok when I' m with them, but then later, I feel sad again. I can' t spend all my time with my friends, of course. They have things to do. So do I. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, you have to be positive at all time and always do something that makes you happy. EOS 3 0 12 I' m trying to be positive. It doesn' t seem to work. I don' t know how to change my mood without chemicals. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you try yoga or meditating as a therapy. EOS 3 0 14 No, I haven' t tried yoga. I thought it was for women. Therapy? You mean like a shrink? EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yoga is not only for women, and yes therapy like a shrink but you don' t have to talk to anybody if you do yoga or meditating. EOS 3 0 16 Oh, meditating by myself? I would need someone to help me learn. Is yoga expensive? I don' t have much money. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yoga is not expensive and meditation doesn' t have to be with anyone, you can use YouTube video as your tutor. It has work for soo many people including my self. EOS 3 0 18 Ok. I' ll check out YouTube. Do I need special clothes or equipment? Or incense or candles or lotoins or something? I' m just a regular guy. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, you have to be in a bright environment. just on the light. EOS 3 0 20 Ok. I can do that. I bet there is something on YouTube about meditation. I' ll give it a try. Thanks for your help! Have a great day! EOS 3 1 21 [Greeting] i hope it work for you.

EOS 6 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah, I' ve definitely felt that way... especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day? EOS 6 0 5 Exactly. Jogging, eating breakfast, getting dressed. EOS 6 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yep, for me it' s kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just" take a break" from grinding. MTurk has kind of helped me get back in a working mindset and given me more energy... have you been doing a lot of MTurk lately? EOS 6 0 7 Yeah, 2020 has been a crazy year. I' ve been doing Mturk here and there. I plan on doing it more. It helps me stay productive. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah it helps, just forcing yourself to have goals, for sure. I' ve been determined to hit a number on MTurk and exercise every time I' m feeling tired, instead of taking a nap because my boss can' t see me, lol. I would definitely say just start setting goals and try to look forward to 2021 being better.

0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how is your day? EOS 0 0 1 Not good. I was told today that my contract is not being renewed once it ends this month. I am very anxious about finding another job during pandemic. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see, It' s been a difficult year for all of us. But I think it would be possible to negotiate. EOS 0 0 3 But I tried negotiating. They are down - sizing the entire sales department. What else can I do? EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Hmmm, I can see that this is stressful for you. Did you already search for a new job? EOS 0 0 5 Yes I am preparing my resume but job vacancies are few and far between. I am worried about my next job.

EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Search online and locally, get help from your friends and I assure you if you try hard enough you will suceed. EOS 0 0 9 I will. How can I get help from friends? Only very few are in sales field. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] And remember, what are we if we stop fighting? Your friends can support you emotionally at least and maybe they know a person that could help you.
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 6 0 1 hi. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing? EOS 6 0 3 Well I' m distraught. EOS 6 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel that way? EOS 6 0 5 Because my girlfriend has left me. EOS 6 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard for you. I haven' t personally had to deal with that, but I have had friends that have. How long were you together? EOS 6 0 7 four years. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being together that long must have made that break up difficult. How are you coping with it? EOS 6 0 9 well I' m not really, especially as she' d gone off with someone else. But I' m to blame which makes it worse. EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened? EOS 6 0 11 I cheated on her on a drunken night. It was a one - off and I regret it terribly. But she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain. EOS 6 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I see how she would be upset. It must be difficult for you though because she didn' t give you another chance. Do you have someone to talk to about your feelings? EOS 6 0 13 yeah, I' m not saying I deserved it just wish she had. But no, not really. No - one who would understand. EOS 6 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I would have wanted a second chance too if I were in your shoes. Is this affecting you really bad? EOS 6 0 15 Yeah I feel so low. EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If your mood is affecting your daily activities, normally that means your mental health has been affected. You could always talk to a professional if it' s hard for you. EOS 6 0 17 it' s difficult though, to open up. EOS 6 1 18 [Self-disclosure] It is. But trust me, it really helps. I' ve been seeing a therapist recently actually and I love it. I don' t have to worry about judgement at all. It' s a hard step but worth it in the end. EOS 6 0 19 They won' t think I' m to blame? EOS 6 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The job of the therapist isn' t to figure out if what you did was wrong or right. It' s to help you understand your feelings and better cope. That' s why they are so great! EOS 6 0 21 oh yeah, that' s a good point. EOS 6 1 22 [Question] Would you like to talk anything else through? EOS 6 0 23 No you' ve been helpful thanks. EOS 6 1 24 [Greeting] no problem! I hope that everything works out for you.
0 0 0 Hello, I' m having a terrible day. My name is Sean and I work for a large distribution company. EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] hi! i' m sorry to hear that. how is your work going so far. EOS 0 0 2 The problem with a job like Amazon or Kehe distribution is the quotas. The pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID? EOS 0 0 4 no COVID 19 has nothing to do with any of this work. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how anxious you are right now. Can you give me some more info on your job. EOS 0 0 6 well when there are 50 million americans out of work right it' s a bit scary. i' m a forklift operator..... I move pallets from one area of the warehouse to another but i. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i totally understand how nerve wrecking this is, but trust me you guys being front - line workers are our real heros. EOS 0 0 8 am based on a quota. I am suppose to be able to move 10 pallets per hour. that' s almost impossible as it is a 1 million square foot warehouse. If i get a pallet on the west side and have to move it to the east side that takes 7 - 10 minutes even if your going dangerously fast. doesn' t feel like it to me. EOS 0 1 9 [Question] did you try discussing your concerns with your Team Lead/ Warehouse Supervisor of your group. EOS 0 0 10 I feel like a replaceable cog in a giant machine that doesn' t give two shits whether I show up for work or not despite having over five years experience with over 12 forklifts..... Yes and they always say the same thing. You need to get your numbers up but it' s a catch 22 you can' t possibly safely get your numbers up and accomplish your quotas. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are doing your best and are working really hard. EOS 0 0 12 so. EOS 0 1 13 [Question] just a thought - did you try changing roles within the warehouse to a different position? or try checking with the manager regarding this. you have 5 years exp, i' m sure you deserve a better role and pay. EOS 0 0 14 I am a felon and I have a bachelores degree in business management. I am desperately trying to get out of the quota based work areas. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] i understand, but when i had a slight trouble with my job, talking to my manager helped me a lot. also, your manager is your best point of contact for a great reference. EOS 0 0 16 Do you know how incredibly hard it is to serve your time in jail for 3 years and get out and can' t find a job except scrubbing floors or cleaning shit or servinge tables. my manager doesn' t give a shit. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] thats hard,.. but you can do it. EOS 0 0 18 do what. work at burger king for$ 7. 25 an hour. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] do your best in your job! hard work ultimately pays off! EOS 0 0 20 I' m not so sure if that' s true anymore. It' s not what you know.... it' s who you know. and with my felony my reputation is nothing but shit. my real worry is that this is one of the highest paying jobs in my area.$ 16 an hour plus almost unlimiteed overtime. for a felon even with a degree that' s phenominal in florida. EOS 0 1 21 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you feel you are not heard and thats why you are pushing yourself hard do you feel that way. EOS 0 0 22 America is just not fair. EOS 0 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Its great that you are working hard despite whatever you faced and I assure that this will help you build a great future in this country. EOS 0 0 24 I will try and talk to my manager, thanks for trying to help me out. have a nice dayl I doubt it. this country is about to fail.. i' ve already made plans to go to brazil. then paraguay. EOS 0 1 25 [Greeting] I wish you all the best Sean! I wish you good luck in all your future endeavors. i hope everything turns out for the best.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hi, I feel really sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am sorry. What is going on? EOS 4 0 3 My friends won' t hang out with me. I am alone all the time. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel like they don' t want to be around you and have nobody to talk to? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, but also just no one to hang out with. I am a loner. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] You prefer it that way?. EOS 4 0 7 No. I want to hang out with people. EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I follow you. It is hard to see people outside of usual social circles right now with the pandemic going on. Out of curiosity tell me what you like doing with others? EOS 4 0 9 I like to talk with them, listen to their stories, just hang out have a good time.. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that. I have not seem my own friends for almost a year because of COVID - 19. It felt isolated and lonely.
4 0 0 I face the situation of me being sad because I thought we could let this fight go over time but instead it has lead to us breaking up. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about the fight? EOS 4 0 2 Yes, so we had a fight previously over Thanksgiving Break about how I woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. Then I pick her up to go try and get breakfast... then she starts punching me while I drive so I pull over. Then she keeps hitting me until I tell her to stop. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple. Is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hi. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] how are you? EOS 3 0 3 Not too good sadly:/ EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I' m sorry. what' s going on?

Turns out he was cheating on me for the past 3 months with his best friend:( EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] whoa, that' s pretty messed up! how long were you together? EOS 3 0 7 Tell me about! We were planning on moving in together next year. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, I definitely wouldn' t go through with that then. Are you sure he was cheating? EOS 3 0 9 I noticed a few signs and confronted him about it. He didn’t even deny it! He wasn’t remorseful at all... it’s like he doesn’t even love me. How can you love someone yet betray the, somquiclu. So quickly** EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] did he admit to it? I would agree that he probably doesn' t feel the way you want him to. EOS 3 0 11 Not at all. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] but you know for certain?
6 0 0 hi my friend. EOS 6 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] Hello! How are you doing? EOS 6 0 2 feeling very shame. EOS 6 1 3 [Question] Oh my god! What happened?
0 0 0 Hello. My name is Spike. What is yours? Is anyone there? I feel kind of sad and rejected that no one is answering. Is this part of the task? EOS 0 1 1 [Others] oh no i' m sorry i left you waited. please tell me your problem. EOS 0 0 2 I' m trying to make money on MTurk and starting a YouTube channel. Money is a big concern for me. EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] We are on the same boat. Do you have any other jobs? EOS 0 0 4 No. That' s my only income right now. It has led to a real crisis of self confidence to me. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you considered applying for a job or trying uber drive/ eats? EOS 0 0 6 I have. But I have health conditions that would mean Covid - 19 would be very risky for me to get. So, I' m trying to work online. I' m trying to stay encouraged. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand how you feel, it' s tough not being able to work and earn much money. However, you are doing your best right now and should feel proud of yourself. EOS 0 0 8 Thanks. I appreciate that. What do you do to stay encouraged or confident? EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I try to spend more time outdoor and keep myself busy. I like to cook since it' s very relaxing and helps keep my mind concentrated. EOS 0 0 10 cooking for me is just another chore. But getting outside might help. I live out in the country. So I have nice scenery. EOS 0 1 11 [Others] That is perfect then, the nature is very healing. You can also hang out with friends and talk to them about how you feel. EOS 0 0 12 It has been days since I even sat on the porch. And weeks since I took a walk. EOS 0 1 13 [Others] you should definitely do that. staying indoor will worsen your mentality. EOS 0 0 14 That' s a good idea. What sort of projects are you working on? Job? Hobby? EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] yeah I have a full time job and working on mturk at night. Covid has hit me financially too. EOS 0 0 16 Wow. that' s a lot. EOS 0 1 17 [Others] we all face different pressure and have to find ways around it. EOS 0 0 18 Yep. You are right. Thanks for the suggestion to get outside. I' m ging out for a walk tomorrow. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Please stay positive, go out more and exercise more frequently.

EOS 3 0 2 a bit sad. more depressed. its just i keep getting benched at work. i' m not really sure what do to.* to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset. EOS 3 0 4 i' m not really sure what i' m doing wrong. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though. EOS 3 0 6 what can i do though? EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there' s anything going on? EOS 3 0 8 hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Of course! That sounds frustrating to not know why it' s happening and not have the opportunity to ask. EOS 3 0 10 yes... hrm. that may work. how can i stop being depressed all the time though.. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' ve also had bosses that are infrequently in the office and make getting good information hard. EOS 3 0 12 how did you fix the issue? i work at home and its like just trying to reach out - they are always busy. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren' t always a reflection of us or how we' re performing. EOS 3 0 14 this whole covid thing has me scrambling to talk to a live person. EOS 3 1 15 [Others] I can imagine!
0 0 0 Good afternoon. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Good afternoon. how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I am not good at all. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] oh no. I am sorry, what happened? EOS 0 0 4 This pandemic is causing too much of trouble for me. Firstly pay cut and now about to layoff. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. This pandemic terrible. sorry to hear that.
1 0 0 Hello I am having pro\ blems with a friend. EOS 1 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so so sorry to hear that. What has been going on?
1 1 0 [Question] hi. how can i help you? EOS 1 0 1 hi. i am really angry. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] are you saying that you are angry now? what happened dear?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day, how are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 Not too well. I have been depessed because of our state shut down and today an old friend from unior high school passed. EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that. I absolutely understand, it' s been hard on most people having to deal with the current state of affairs and losing people.. Do you think things will improve?
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state. EOS 0 0 6 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well. EOS 0 0 8 Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing( which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all. I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out. EOS 0 0 10 What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job: it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. Working there would be ministry, not typical work. And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, that' s a big deal. i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it. EOS 0 0 12 Thank you. I believe there are three things in my favor: I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current( related) job fifteen years ago. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] even by working there, you will surely meet new friends. do you know many people from the church?
4 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 4 0 2 I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age? EOS 4 0 4 He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough, both for you and him. I know it' s meaningless to tell you not to be sad, however, you can think that he' s not in a better place. EOS 4 0 6 I presume you mean now and not not;). Though I simply am not a believer. It just made me think how meaningless life was.. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn' t it? I sometimes think it' s meaningless too. EOS 4 0 8 I do not really know what to do about my feelings. They are not going away. EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I feel you, coping with losing your loved ones is never easy. In fact, it' s confusing when you grieve and even when you recover and move on. EOS 4 0 10 Do you think that people ever really recover from a significant bereavement? I think that what you said there was very wise. Maybe it' s worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened.. there is guilt that comes with that. EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t think people can completely get over that, you just get used to the pain of not having them around. EOS 4 0 12 Whilst it hurts to think about him being dead, I think that it would hurt more if I had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I just need you to know that whatever your feeling is, it' s completely normal and you shouldn' t feel guilty for having it. EOS 4 0 14 It is just - very hard. I keep thinking about all the times I disagreed with him or did not appreciate him enough and I never got to tell him how much I loved him. EOS 4 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Your dad wouldn' t want to see you grieving everyday either. You should live the way you know he' d love to see. I believe he knew you loved him regardless how much you two argued. EOS 4 0 16 I know that he did:). I had just not expected to lose him at such a comparatively young age. He did not get to enjoy his retirement! EOS 4 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] That' s sad when he spent all his time taking care of the family and yet could not enjoy his free time. EOS 4 0 18 Yes. I think it would have been easier to deal with had he not immediately descended into very bad health as soon as he retired and had had time to have some fun. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you considered seeking therapist? We almost never think of that service, but in a lot of case, people actually need help from professionals when grieving.
4 0 0 I' m feeling really sad, I thought it was going somewhere. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What do you mean you thought it was going somewhere? Are you okay? EOS 4 0 2 yes I' m okay, I' m so sad. five years, I gave my heart to this girl. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Did you guys break up recently? EOS 4 0 4 yes she broke my heart last night, what did I do wrong? EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong. You shouldn' t blame yourself. EOS 4 0 6 but I gave her my all. I feel so betrayed. I' m feeling so sad I want to jump over a bridge. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there, a few years before I was married, my boyfriend broke up with me. We had some space, and then were able to become friends again. And you know what? We ended up getting back together and getting married.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 I am fine thank you. How are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am very well. Do you have any problems you' d like to discuss with me? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I am having trouble figuring out how to handel a situation with a friend. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah, can you give me a few more details? I am sure I will be able to help/ EOS 0 0 5 Her husband was justshot and kiled over a drug deal. He was high on drugs at the time. My dayghter and his daughter are good friends and we carpool with them every day. He was often the driver not my friend. Was he high when he was driving my daughter arround? Did my friend know he was on drugs? EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow that is a tough one - I can see why you would be concerned about it. At least, though, you can be assured that she is safe and is never going to come to any harm as a result of his driving now. EOS 0 0 7 Agreed but it is hard to not be suspicious that the mom knew something about hi actions. Yet I feel horrible that she lost her husband. EOS 0 1 8 [Others] I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it:( EOS 0 0 9 I know. I am trying to be supportive and help her with her kids but a part of me is still anxious that she may have played me. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] People can hold values that to other people seem strange. She might not have considered it wrong to be driving on drugs, even though it is. EOS 0 0 11 Very true. I really never even considered that! EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would not make it acceptable though! EOS 0 0 13 No, absolutely not! But I never looked at it that way. EOS 0 1 14 [Others] At least you can feel relieved that your daughter is safe now:) EOS 0 0 15 Yes. I am very relieved. He was recently in a car accident before he died. Luckily no one was hurt and the girls were not in the car! He totaled his brand new truck though. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think the best you can do right now is just be there for your friend when she wants to talk. EOS 0 0 17 Definitely trying to be! EOS 0 1 18 [Question] Is she able to support herself financially? EOS 0 0 19 Yes she received payouts from several large life insurance policies so they are safe financially. Just a mess emotionally. EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe it can be a good opportunity for her to change her lifestyle and get off the drugs. On that note, I hope I have been able to give you some reassurance and thanks for talking! EOS 0 0 21 Thank you so much! You were very helpful! EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you' re welcome:)( you need to quit your end; I can' t from this end:)) if you just press quit and answer the questions;)
4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 i feel depresed. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Why do you feel depressed? EOS 4 0 3 breakup with my partner. EOS 4 1 4 [Others] Breakups can be really tough. How long were you with your partner? EOS 4 0 5 3years of time we have been in love. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I once had a relationship end after 5 years with a partner. Staying active really helped me get over the relationship. Through that activity I actually met my new partner! EOS 4 0 7 but i love my partner so much that i couldnt forget her right now. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about doing something fun, like taking a trip somewhere?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi my name is Sarah, how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hi, Sarah. I am at my wits end. I feel like I am going crazy. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That sounds stressful. What' s happening? EOS 0 0 3 I am stressed out about having to move and I just can' t seem to calm down when it is time to sleep.. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Moving is such a stressful time. When do you move?. EOS 0 0 5 I am moving in a month, but there is just so much to do before then. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. What is your wind - down routine like in the evening, if you have one? EOS 0 0 7 I usually put my kids to bed and then try to relax for about an hour while I watch tv before I head to bed. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Oh you' re a parent AND you are moving, you have a lot on your plate! EOS 0 0 9 Yes, I am a homeschooling mother of two.. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried a warm bath before bed? that' s helped me before. Meditation to still my mind before sleeping helps too. I' ve read that a small carb snack before bed, like a peice of toast, is supposed to help us fall asleep, I haven' t tried it though.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today. EOS 3 0 2 I feel bad putting this on your shoulders, maybe you can help. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] i have big shoulders! whats on your mind? EOS 3 0 4 I' m just struggling a lot to find the motivation to do anything at all, even the most basic of things. Sometimes I get very intense feelings of sadness and just want to drop everything I' m doing, like I can' t do anything more. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] i think a lot of people are feeling that way these past few months. do you think it is covid related? not sickness, more depression. EOS 3 0 6 Yes that' s very true, depression is probably hitting people the worst right now. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] its becoming a new normal lol. EOS 3 0 8 No I' ve been fighting depression since I was probably like 12 years old, it first really hit me when I moved from where I was living all my life and lost all my friends and I was terrified. Now I' m 29. But covid definitely plays a factor. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] a few months ago i was feeling the same way. i dont have health insurance but googled and found some online docturs. i got to see a doc and get on antidepressants for less than a hundred. covid plays a factor in EVERYTHING ugh.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello. How can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 What should I do. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Tell me about the situation that you are facing.
1 0 0 Hi. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello though, how has life been treating you lately? EOS 1 0 2 It' s been a pretty crazy year. I' m mostly bummed because of my work. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It has been a really weird year hasn' t it? Don' t worry, I think it' s been the same for all of us. Would you like to tell me more details? EOS 1 0 4 Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else' s pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss( the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That really sucks! I can understand why you are angry and anxious about this and you have every right to be!. Are there any official routes that you can use to complain? EOS 1 0 6 I work in supply chain and I see the actual sales numbers and realized 4 months ago that we were actually on track to exceed our plans, even with the covid reductions. a few weeks later I heard him tell our sales director to keep the numbers artificially low so that they will both get their bonuses. I don' t think so... He' s the VP there isn' t anyone I can go to above him. EOS 1 1 7 [Others] That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint?. It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this. EOS 1 0 8 I don' t know if it is or not... I used my EAP benefit through work where you can talk to a councilor for free( 5 visits) and they said that it' s unfortunate but they didn' t think it was illegal. EOS 1 1 9 [Others] I am very sorry to hear that, that sounds extremely unfair to me. Have you considered looking for another job? I realise it' s a very difficult time to be looking for work right now though. EOS 1 0 10 yeah, it' s tough.. I don' t know if anyone is hiring. because of the timing like you mentioned. I' ve looked a little bit though. EOS 1 1 11 [Others] I really can' t wait for this year to be over! It' s been so awful. Do you suppose anyone at all has had a good year? EOS 1 0 12 haha I don' t know... I' m sure someone has... heck the VP is getting a Bonus... so I' m sure he' d say he' s having a good year. EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well yes fair point! Us poorer people are not doing very well though! Have you tried to talk with any of your coworkers about this? I would suggest that it might help. EOS 1 0 14 Amen.. That' s a good call, I' ve got a work buddy who I feel somewhat comfortable talking with. I may try and reach out to him. EOS 1 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really think you should. You have a legitimate grievance and being able to discuss it with people who understand might help a lot. EOS 1 0 16 I feel a little guilty about sharing what I know because I almost feel like ignorance is bliss at this point. But then I feel guilty for keeping that info. EOS 1 1 17 [Others] I feel that people have the right to know what is being done and will be happy you told them. EOS 1 0 18 I agree and I think you' re right. I appreciate you chatting with me about this. EOS 1 1 19 [Greeting] You are very welcome. I hope I have been able to be of some help to you and you will continue to talk to other people about it.
1 0 0 hi there. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hi! Hope you are doing well. How can I help you today? EOS 1 0 2 I am having such a hard time falling asleep at night.... I toss and turn and cannot shut my mind off. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep. Hope I get it right? EOS 1 0 4 yes that' s right. my mind just races thinking about problems it seems. I am irritable and frustrated. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Is there a specific thing or task which is bothering you for long? EOS 1 0 6 I worry about my daughter, she has addictions. I never know if she is okay or not, she doesn' t call me very often and is hard to get a hold of. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It must be a tough time for you and is a enough reason to not getting good sleep. despite of it you should need a complete rest. EOS 1 0 8 Have you any suggestions to help me get to sleep easier? I have tried meditation, but it doesn' t seem to help much. EOS 1 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I feels like you are having less energy and feel tired due to lack of sleep. Try to follow a particular schedule and u can put soothing music before bed. It might calm you down and make you sleep. EOS 1 0 10 That' s a good idea I can try that. My bedtimes are kind of mixed up, maybe setting a particular schedule will help, I' ll try that. sometimes i go to be early, sometimes late, maybe that is screwing me up. EOS 1 1 11 [Self-disclosure] When I have sleeping problem, I take warm shower. It help me a lot. EOS 1 0 12 good idea, i could try that. EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] As far as I know if we follow a particular time to go to bed eventually We start feeling sleepy at that time or body adapt it. EOS 1 0 14 oh ok, that makes sense. i wish my daughter lived closer so i can check on her, she is in another city which makes it hard. i worry. ok well thankyou for your help. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can understand how hard it is for you. But nothing stays same. I wish your daughter will come out of it soon and wishing her success. Meditation can help you too. Before sleeping you can concentrate on your breath. EOS 1 0 16 I appreciate your suggestions and will give them a try. The warm shower sounds like a really good idea. Thankyou so much. are you a parent? EOS 1 1 17 [Others] Best wish for you! Wishing you will have a nice sleep and refresh day afterwards.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 hello. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 0 0 3 I need ways alleviate stress while studying. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there. EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck. EOS 0 0 7 How did you push past that job? EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work. EOS 0 0 9 Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career? EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too. EOS 0 0 11 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Can you give me some more details? EOS 0 0 13 I just find the work mundane and way too remedial. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable. EOS 0 0 15 did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job? EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have you a few, there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit. EOS 0 0 17 what types of skill can I gain online? EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Indeed is one of the better ones to look for jobs, honestly I would suggest looking at jobs that you normally wouldn' t and see what kind of qualifications they need and see if you can get that done online. EOS 0 0 19 so filter based on my absolute needs and go for online skills that I can complete? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes I think that is a great idea, look for jobs that meet your needs and figure out what you can do to look attractive to employers. EOS 0 0 21 I have tried glassdoor before, have you had any luck there? EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used it a bit, I mainly used indeed. EOS 0 0 23 and have you showcased your skills using LinkedIn before? I have had that one recommended to me before, they said its a great way to neatly organize accomplishments and personal background. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes especially if you are applying for anything in a professional setting that is very important. EOS 0 0 25 do you have any examples of online skills you completed? EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] coursera has a lot of great courses, it really depends on what you are looking for. EOS 0 0 27 if I was looking to enter the engineering field, any recommendations? EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Is that what you are going to school for? EOS 0 0 29 yes but I may change my mind. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] What year are you in? most engineering programs have a practicum and that is a great opportunity to make contacts and potentially get offered a job. EOS 0 0 31 yes I have been networking as I go. EOS 0 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly you seem like you are pretty on top of this I don' t think you will have any issues finding a job. EOS 0 0 33 yeah I mean the topic was about final exam stress but we got on a tangent. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Yes that is fair enough, how much time do you have until your exam? EOS 0 0 35 15 minutes. EOS 0 1 36 [Affirmation and Reassurance] While that is plenty of time to get some studying done:)
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay just anxious. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that' s bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I believe i am going to fail all my finals for college. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] College finals are a stressful time for sure, I' m sure you' re doing your best to prepare. EOS 0 0 6 Yes i have been studying for hours everyday. sometimes it is hard to focus. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s best to take a short break to reset when you feel like your gears are grinding. EOS 0 0 8 that is true, but i feel guilty when i take breaks. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I often feel the same way when I' m not busy doing work. But sometimes you need that little break to get back into the zone and be more productive. EOS 0 0 10 I try to take multiple 5 min breaks throughout my studying but it usually turns into hours breaks lol. its hard to focus. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You sounds pretty stressed about it, make sure you' re getting enough sleep so you don' t get run down. EOS 0 0 12 Yes i. do sleep for at least 10 hours. i also take 20 minute power naps because i have read somewhere it helps. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there someone you could study with to help break up how you' re studying? EOS 0 0 14 yes i live with a roommate and we are in the same program, but i sometimes feel dumb when i study with her. EOS 0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Try not to think of yourself that way. I' m sure you both provide a benefit to each other while studying.
2 1 0 [Question] hi! how are you doing today> EOS 2 0 1 Hello, I' m doing okay, wbu? EOS 2 1 2 [Others] ok it' s been a stressful time for most of us but we are all doing the best we can. EOS 2 0 3 Yeah that' s true. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] whats been the weirdest part of the pandemic for you? EOS 2 0 5 So I live with my boyfriend and my bestfriend. And I am afraid they are doing skethy stuff behind my back. It sounds crazy, and I don' t have any proof but I have this feeling. The way they talk around each other makes me nervous. EOS 2 1 6 [Question] hmm, tell me more. what do you think is going on?
2 0 0 Good afternoon/ evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you tonight? EOS 2 0 2 Doing great. How about yourself? EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I' m doing well how can I help you tonight? EOS 2 0 4 So, the issue I' m having is work - related. My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He' s also in the middle of testing for CP. My job requires that I be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask... but sometimes the people I am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6 - foot boundary. A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills. My son just turned 2. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you' d wish they wear a mask? EOS 2 0 6 I have. A few people respected my wishes. But one in particular stands out. A gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. He got angry at my request. In my shoes, what would you do? Because I feel like Im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol. EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don' t honor your requests?
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, what brings you to bring the seeker? EOS 6 0 1 I feel upset with myself over my situation. Did you read it? EOS 6 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I did not see it. What is your situation? I am here to listen.
0 0 0 Hello. My name is Spike. What is yours? Is anyone there? I feel kind of sad and rejected that no one is answering. Is this part of the task? EOS 0 1 1 [Others] oh no i' m sorry i left you waited. please tell me your problem. EOS 0 0 2 I' m trying to make money on MTurk and starting a YouTube channel. Money is a big concern for me. EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] We are on the same boat. Do you have any other jobs? EOS 0 0 4 No. That' s my only income right now. It has led to a real crisis of self confidence to me. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you considered applying for a job or trying uber drive/ eats? EOS 0 0 6 I have. But I have health conditions that would mean Covid - 19 would be very risky for me to get. So, I' m trying to work online. I' m trying to stay encouraged. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand how you feel, it' s tough not being able to work and earn much money. However, you are doing your best right now and should feel proud of yourself. EOS 0 0 8 Thanks. I appreciate that. What do you do to stay encouraged or confident? EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I try to spend more time outdoor and keep myself busy. I like to cook since it' s very relaxing and helps keep my mind concentrated. EOS 0 0 10 cooking for me is just another chore. But getting outside might help. I live out in the country. So I have nice scenery. EOS 0 1 11 [Others] That is perfect then, the nature is very healing. You can also hang out with friends and talk to them about how you feel. EOS 0 0 12 It has been days since I even sat on the porch. And weeks since I took a walk. EOS 0 1 13 [Others] you should definitely do that. staying indoor will worsen your mentality. EOS 0 0 14 That' s a good idea. What sort of projects are you working on? Job? Hobby? EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] yeah I have a full time job and working on mturk at night. Covid has hit me financially too.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, I' m pretty much down. trying to keep my head afloat. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] im sorry to hear that. Would you care to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 3 0 3 I lost my job some months back and it hasn' t really been easy for me. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, loss of income can be very stressful. Have you been looking for work since then? EOS 3 0 5 Sometimes when I enter a place where my friends are, they tend to go silent when I enter the room. Yes. Its been months now and nothing yet. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Why do you think it is that they go silent? EOS 3 0 7 I' m pretty sure they were talking about me. 2 of myy friends have been helping me with rent money. and I' m pretty sure they must be fed up. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried picking up odd jobs maybe cleaning for someone or helping them move or organize there things? EOS 3 0 9 Yes I have. That' s what helps with feeding and getting some little things at home. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Have you asked them if this is causing problems?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that? EOS 0 0 21 being on the board gives me perks. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit? EOS 0 0 23 yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there' s an element of mutual manipulation. EOS 0 0 25 yes. EOS 0 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are definitely not the only person to feel this way! EOS 0 0 27 it' s a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power.. what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board. EOS 0 0 29 i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment. EOS 0 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] But that is rather manipulative of you. EOS 0 0 31 if you were me you would forget about him and the board. EOS 0 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I definitely would do that. EOS 0 0 33 thing is he is encouraging me to be like that. cuz it helps him too. okay. i' ll try to lay low and walk away from it. EOS 0 1 34 [Others] I think it' s time for a clear severance. Do you have any other people you are interested in? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 35 yes but it' s less than before cuz of Covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this - if that makes sense. EOS 0 1 36 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah I hear you. You feel that your options are rather more limited than previously because of the lockdown? EOS 0 0 37 yes. EOS 0 1 38 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is something I believe that most of us are feeling right now so I sympathise. EOS 0 0 39 true. i just have to be strong about it with him. even if he likes me i don' t think it' s a healthy relationship. i slept with one of his friends and the other one wanted to sleep with me too. EOS 0 1 40 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be. Is he aware that this happened? EOS 0 0 41 yes when it comes down to it. he suspected it happened. his friend asked the one i slept with if it was true. he denied it. so i think he suspected it. EOS 0 1 42 [Question] Do you feel guilty about this? EOS 0 0 43 now that im talking to him i do a little. it felt good at the time like i was getting back at him. you can tell this is a very twisted situation. EOS 0 1 44 [Question] Do you feel that you want to get revenge on him? EOS 0 0 45 not really. i just felt that if he stayed with me i wouldn' t have slept with his friend and almost did with his other one. EOS 0 1 46 [Others] I am not sure what to say that will help your problem and give you closure. EOS 0 0 47 thank ya for listening. i think it' ll clarify itself in time. EOS 0 1 48 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I hope so and I really do hope for the best for you. These are difficult times for all of us!
0 0 0 I am very worried about losing my job. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello - How are you today? EOS 0 0 2 Anxious. I think my boss wants to fire me. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so sorry you are worried about losing your job. I have been in your shoes before. Why do you think your boss wants to fire you? EOS 0 0 4 Thank you. I think if I am late again, I will be let go.. I have a sick child and my boss does not understand. How can I explain that I may be late to the office, but that I am a valuable employee? EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Have you explained to him your reasoning? I also once had to take care of my sick grandmother after work and had a tough time explaining it to my boss. Have you offered to stay later to make up the work? EOS 0 0 6 No. But that is a good idea. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe your boss can compromise with you. It' s worth a shot! EOS 0 0 8 It' s a very competitive office and I don' t want to look weak. EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] You sound like you care about this job and that is a valuable asset in a an employee. EOS 0 0 10 I do. I hope I can explain the situation clearly and offer to make up time by staying late. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand. Is there a coworker or mentor that maybe you can talk to? EOS 0 0 12 I will reach out to HR. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a great idea! EOS 0 0 14 Thank you. You have been very helpful and uplifting. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Also review your employee handbook and see if there are things you can do to negotiate with HR or your boss in regards to your hours. Always best to come prepared:) EOS 0 0 16 My anxiety is disappearing with the suggestions you have offered. EOS 0 1 17 [Question] That' s great! I am happy I could help you during such a difficult time. How long have you been at the job? EOS 0 0 18 I have only been here for 6 months. I think being new is contributing to the anxiety I am feeling. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. Being new at a job can have its difficulties. From speaking with you, it seems like you are caring and hardworking.
2 0 0 Good evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hi, how' s things? EOS 2 0 2 Things are ok I am just having issues with the problem above. EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I am afraid that I am not able to see that.. can you tell me about it? EOS 2 0 4 Yes, so I have always done very well in school and university. I have always had A' s or high B' s. Last semester in university, I failed one of my exams. I still passed the class with an A, but for some reason, that exam haunts me and gives me bad dreams. I don' t know why it happens and it worries me. EOS 2 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - when I was sitting my final exams I constantly had nightmares about failing. Nearly thirty years on and I still do!! But - you did really very well and you passed with an A. Do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself? EOS 2 0 6 Maybe, I got a 46% on the exam( so an F) but I did all my other assignments and exams almost perfect and got an A overall. I never once failed a test in my life, and have always held myself to a very high academic degree to make my parents proud. I come from a poor family, so succeeding in life is very important to m, e. me* EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds as though you feel that academic success is the most important thing in your life, would I be right in thinking this? EOS 2 0 8 Yes you are correct. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered talking to anyone about these feelings of perfectionism? A therapist perhaps? There is a good deal of useful help and information out there for people who are struggling. EOS 2 0 10 I have not, actually. I don' t think my family can afford a therapist, especially with the pandemic raging right now. Where do you recommend going? EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Does your school have any counsellors offering help for free? Many do. I believe that there are some charities that will offer a certain number of free therapy sessions too. EOS 2 0 12 I don' t think any are available since my school is online only, also the campus i s completely closed due to Winter Break. Oh? Charities? EOS 2 1 13 [Others] Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you. EOS 2 0 14 I have never heard of such people, I am interested. EOS 2 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Really though I think that your problem is self esteem.. you should think better of yourself:) I can tell that you set yourself a very high standard but I also think that you need to be kind to yourself. EOS 2 0 16 I think you' re right, but I don' t know, I' m still scared about having the bad dreams. I often wake up 2 - 3 times at night because of them. EOS 2 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - this has been happening to me all of my life. Have you tried to take anything to help? I can recommend a hot milky drink before bed and perhaps a hot water bottle. Anyway I hope that I have been able to be of some assistance to you! Have a lovely holiday season. EOS 2 0 18 Thank you, I' ll try to do just that. Merry Christmas to you. EOS 2 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] And you:) remember to hit the quit button and take the survey;)
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday? EOS 6 0 2 I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I' m too scared to do anything about it as I don' t want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can' t help it. EOS 6 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through. EOS 6 0 4 Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I' m a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self - respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it. EOS 6 0 6 What happened out of interest when you had the conversation? EOS 6 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist. Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more. Since that time, he denies everything. EOS 6 0 8 I know. I' m a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It' s superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas' punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends.. EOS 6 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly, its not anyone else' s business. IF you' re suspicions are in fact correct, then you' ve got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart - breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she' s cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o= is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER! Curiously, why do you think she' s cheating?
1 0 0 I am so mad that I can' t see straight. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello! What is on your mind today? Oh really? Why is that? EOS 1 0 2 Well, my boyfriend has cheated so many times that I cant count them. I then meet someone nice and cheat on him once and now he breaks up with me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] being mad that your boyfriend cheated is normal. being mad when dumped is normal. don' t you think you DESERVE better than he was treating you? EOS 1 0 4 Thank you! I can see that I am talking to someone who understands. I am wondering if I should beg him back?? I really do love him. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there too. Expecially with covid, it can be hard realiing you may be alone and it may be frusterating dating someone new. if you really love someone, shouldnt they love you back? did his actions show love? EOS 1 0 6 Yeah, and we have been together since high school so it is really hard to think of ever marrying anyone else. He asked me to marry him but we never made it official or got rings. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak. i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart. EOS 1 0 8 He told me he never wants kids with me but acts like he would have them someday, somehow? I think you' re right. EOS 1 1 9 [Self-disclosure] i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter. trust me, its not worth it in the long run. maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you! EOS 1 0 10 Noway! That is my worst nightmare, I am so sorry. That is a real eye opener for me/ That is exactly what I don' t think I could handle. I just am in the worst cycle ever and don' t have any friends to turn to or anybody who wants to listen to the drama. I think I have wasted a lot of my life and I can' t ever get the time back that I have invested in him. EOS 1 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i think a lot of couples are feeling stuck with covid. once things open up and everyone is vaccinated and get togethers happen again, i bet there will be a LOT more breakups and a lot more options out there! all we can do is learn from our mistakes and not let the past repeat itself. EOS 1 0 12 Yeah, I can see your point. It is nice being able to vent to you and feel like I am being heard. I never got that in my relationship with him. I need to learn from the past this time and stop repeating it. EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] with your newly aquired free time, you can focus on you! start a new hobby, dye your hair, do something you always wanted to do! EOS 1 0 14 I haven' t even had the time to get myself cute and fixed up in forever! I love that idea! I need to get my haircut. EOS 1 1 15 [Question] know what the best part is? EOS 1 0 16 No, I have idea? EOS 1 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] get yourself fixed up and cute, and find a hot new guy. your ex will see on social media and know he messed up and see you happy. its quite theraputic: D EOS 1 0 18 HAHA!! YES!! I was thinking the exact same thing! The best revenge is moving on and looking good and with somebody hot! EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] EXACTLY! You deserve so much better! Make yourself feel like it and everyone see it!: D: D.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 Am ok but feeling sad and anxious. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that you are sad and anxious. Do you know what is causing you to feel that way? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I recently lost my childhood best friend to covid 19. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can only imagine how sad you feel from losing your best friend. Hopefully chatting some will help. I know in the past when I lost someone it was nice to just have a conversation to help put my mind at ease. EOS 0 0 5 Sure. I feel so lonely sometimes because we were very close. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that you are feeling lonely. Did you have any mutual friends with your best friend that you can reach out to? I am sure they are feeling the same way and it could help both of you to talk to each other and share stories. EOS 0 0 7 Yes we have mutual friends. I do reach out to them sometimes. But the feeling doesn' t go away. It makes me have sleepless nights. I can' t sleep. Every time I close my eyes I see him very close to me like we are having conversations. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you were really close to your best friend. It can take time to get through the grief of losing someone. Things will get better I promise. EOS 0 0 9 I hope so too. And I hope he is a better place. Have you ever lost someone close to you? EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I lost my father when I was 19. That was pretty tough and it took me years to be OK with it. There are still days a decade later where I think about him and miss him. EOS 0 0 11 Sorry to hear that.. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Time heals all wounds. While that doesn' t sound helpful now it is true. I also found focusing on the good experiences I had with my father( or in this case your best friend) helps. Remembering the times where you both were happy. EOS 0 0 13 I will try to do that. How can I handle this sleepless nights? EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s a tough one. I personally still struggle with sleep for other reasons. Some things that can help is taking melatonin 30 minutes before bed. I have also had some luck with white noise machines or other soothing sound machines. The biggest thing is to not use your bedroom for anything but sleeping; so don' t read a book or play on your phone in bed, you have to train your body that when you go to bed it is time to sleep.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Nice to meet you Jim, I am doing well. Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 3 I really appreciate your time Yes. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What is on your mind? EOS 0 0 5 I have been retired for over 2 years and would like to return to the workforce, part - ti me. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are thinking of going back to work? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, It would help us greatly. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have the right idea already. EOS 0 0 9 There are plenty of jobs and not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will find something suitable if you keep trying. EOS 0 0 11 Thanks What do you mean? Yeah, I know this but I don' t feel it.. EOS 0 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] You may feel a little apprehensive to get started. EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, I am. I know I can do it. Not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have been in the same position before and came out successful in the end. EOS 0 0 15 Wow, That' s great. How did you start?. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I just decided. EOS 0 0 17 What gave you the strength to go forward? I have this nervousness about getting rejected.. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing little things every day. EOS 0 0 19 So, keep myself busy and try to ignore my nervousness? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Really adds up and helps to get the big picture moving.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi my name is Sarah, how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hi, Sarah. I am at my wits end. I feel like I am going crazy. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That sounds stressful. What' s happening? EOS 0 0 3 I am stressed out about having to move and I just can' t seem to calm down when it is time to sleep.. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Moving is such a stressful time. When do you move?. EOS 0 0 5 I am moving in a month, but there is just so much to do before then. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. What is your wind - down routine like in the evening, if you have one? EOS 0 0 7 I usually put my kids to bed and then try to relax for about an hour while I watch tv before I head to bed. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Oh you' re a parent AND you are moving, you have a lot on your plate! EOS 0 0 9 Yes, I am a homeschooling mother of two.. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried a warm bath before bed? that' s helped me before. Meditation to still my mind before sleeping helps too. I' ve read that a small carb snack before bed, like a peice of toast, is supposed to help us fall asleep, I haven' t tried it though. EOS 0 0 11 A bath does sound really relaxing. I have tried some meditations. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One thing I highly recommend is a podcast called" Tracks to Relax". EOS 0 0 13 Thanks, I will have to try that. Music does tend to calm me down. I don' t know why I haven' t tried that. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It' s guided sleep meditations, and his voice is incredibly soothing.... works well for me on nights I can' t naturally fall asleep. He leads you relaxing walks into the forest and such things, it' s very peaceful. EOS 0 0 15 I really appreciate that help, I will try it for sure. I think it will be easier to focus on a meditation with someone talking me through it. EOS 0 1 16 [Question] Have you a partner sharing the childrearing?

Do you have plans for the holidays? EOS 0 1 5 [Others] not really, i will probably just relax. what about you? EOS 0 0 6 Just hanging out at home with my husband and son. EOS 0 1 7 [Others] how' s your relationship with your family?
4 0 0 I am so embarassed and saddened. I can not believe he cheated on me. I thought we were going to work out. I was really attracted into him and I cared for him a lot. I wanted to date him longer. Thank Goodness I did not sleep with him. What a disaster. Why are men like this? Why do they break women' s hearts? I wish there were more decent men out there that did not play around. Men can be such pigs! EOS 4 1 1 [Question] what happened? EOS 4 0 2 I met a handsome intelligent man. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how are you feeling lately? EOS 4 0 4 We dated for a month. Then out of nowhere he cheated on me. I' m so sad. I am just trying to understand what I did wrong. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s okay. we should learn from things like this. EOS 4 0 6 That' s true. It' s crazy we have to experience heart ache. To learn... EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] don' t think much and keep yourself engaged in the activities you like the most. EOS 4 0 8 Hey, that is great advice! EOS 4 1 9 [Question] can you tell me how are you before this incident? EOS 4 0 10 I was happy. But when a man breaks your heart, it makes you feel very ugly. EOS 4 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] can you share me some happy memories which made you smile. EOS 4 0 12 Sure, I love going to the movies! How about you! EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] it' s okay. i can understand. yeah me too. i love movies and traveling.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there how can be of help? EOS 3 0 2 I am suffering from low mood and general depression. I don' t know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down( obviously) and there doesn' t appear to be any real reason behind it. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue? EOS 3 0 4 I felt this way for a while actually isn' t a recent change it' s been building slowly over time. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same? EOS 3 0 6 I think I know what you mean. It' s getting worse. I feel very down. EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse. EOS 3 0 8 Yeah. I worry that I' ll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. I' m really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Firstly, you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with depression and it' s good that you have reached out for help for this.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hi, I feel really sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am sorry. What is going on? EOS 4 0 3 My friends won' t hang out with me. I am alone all the time. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel like they don' t want to be around you and have nobody to talk to? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, but also just no one to hang out with. I am a loner. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] You prefer it that way?. EOS 4 0 7 No. I want to hang out with people. EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I follow you. It is hard to see people outside of usual social circles right now with the pandemic going on. Out of curiosity tell me what you like doing with others?
4 1 0 [Question] Hey there, what' s going on today? EOS 4 0 1 Hello. It is a fine day, how about yourself? EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] It really is! I am just taking in the fresh air in the backyard. EOS 4 0 3 That is awesome. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Thanks! What is going on in your neck of the woods? EOS 4 0 5 Sort of stuck inside trying to make a dime but it is alright. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Yeah great minds think alike.. do you do anything else for work? EOS 4 0 7 Looking for a good job right now. I wanted to talk about a personal issue I have been having, though. EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Okay, you know I' m here for you. Talk to me, what' s happening? EOS 4 0 9 My father and I had a fight 2 years ago and haven' t spoke since. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] The same happened to me, and then my father passed away. If there is anything I can say, is to swallow pride and cherish the moments you have on earth together. What was the fight over? EOS 4 0 11 Yeah I am afraid that these things can happen. It was only over material things. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] That was my next question, what the fight was over. Do you think he would be open to mending things? EOS 4 0 13 It is weird because I called him out for being manipulative so this is his defense.. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Usually when people feel singled out, they only have a few mechanisms. Unfortunately, most people tend to run away instead of fixing things. It tends to be the easier option. EOS 4 0 15 I would likely take advantage of an opportunity to be the bigger person. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] When you try to fix things, just remember that this is his method. I wouldn' t hold back on what you have to say, but just word it so that he doesn' t feel the need to flee. EOS 4 0 17 That is probably decent advice. EOS 4 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is HIS responsibility as a parent to want to fix things, but you are also being the bigger person here. I applaud you and hope that he is receptive. EOS 4 0 19 I hope so too, but the opportunity seems tenuous. EOS 4 1 20 [Question] How did you guys leave it?
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday?
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! How are you today? EOS 3 0 2 Ok I guess. I do not know how to tell my husband that I am lonely and I want out of the marriage. EOS 3 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, that sure is a heavy subject and a heavy thing to be on your mind. EOS 3 0 4 He is not one you can talk to he usually just brushes things off. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have tried to discuss your loneliness with your husband before? EOS 3 0 6 Yes he tells me it’s just in my head and I could just go out with him, but he drinks then to much so I do not like going out with him. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] I am sure that is frustrating! Does he drink at home as well or just when you go out?
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 I' m sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What happened? EOS 4 0 3 My ex - boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Why did he break up with you? EOS 4 0 5 because I didn' t trust him and I was always jelous. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think you should try finding a psychologist to help your jealous. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I think so, because I should not feel like that, I should trust him. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Apparently psychologist is good for people who want to share feelings and emotions. EOS 4 0 9 Yes, it' s true. Thanks for the information. I' m trying not to talk to him or think about him, because I feel better. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s good for you to do that. You' ll feel better with time.
4 0 0 Hi. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing these days? EOS 4 0 2 Not good. You? EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry to hear that. I am doing fine and hope I can cheer you up. EOS 4 0 4 Good to hear. Been feeling lonely due to this pandemic. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I totally understand it. I felt lonely too by staying home all the time. But I found we can borrow books online. A good book can really help. EOS 4 0 6 Do you mean physical or ebooks? EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Both will help. But ebooks are easier to get and you don' t need to contact anyone and anything outside your home. EOS 4 0 8 Any genres you would suggest? EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I like biographies. Stories of real people are inspiring.
1 0 0 im very upset. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry. Would you like to tell me about it? EOS 1 0 2 yes. i invited my friend over to watch my new puppy while i painted my room because my dog has seperation anxiety and can' t be alone. then she showed up with her new boyfriend. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] What bothered you about that? EOS 1 0 4 well i dont know him and my stuff was all out in the living room where he was alone for most of the day. i actually didnt suspect anything would happen at first. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can see why that would upset you though. Did something happen?
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you doing? EOS 1 0 1 Hi, I' m ok. How are you? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] Not bad, it' s a peaceful night. Anything in particular you' d like to talk about? EOS 1 0 3 That' s great. My job refused my request to continue to work from home. So I was pretty much forced to go into a school where the cases are growing. EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I imagine that' s very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being? EOS 1 0 5 Just to make sure I' m wearing my mask, washing my hands, and social distancing. Which is not enough. There are more and more teachers getting infected and I just feel it a matter of time before it my turn.. I fear that I will bring this home to my family and I will not survive it. I have pre existing conditions. EOS 1 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry that you' re having to deal with such stressful circumstances. You can only control what you can control. Have you discussed these concerns with the school and explained the preexisting conditions? I get it though. It' s scary for everyone at this point.
0 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? I am feeling rather sad. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hi there. Yes, What is making you sad?
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed! EOS 7 0 7 And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that' s one method I have used.. Thank you for your trust in me.. EOS 7 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don' t overdo it.. EOS 7 0 9 I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible. true, very true.. Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen? EOS 7 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you. EOS 7 0 11 Thanks for sympathizing and understanding.. EOS 7 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation. EOS 7 0 13 ok. That' s true and I have to do more of that. Phone is also a big distraction for me. I heard that it' s best to get it out of one' s reach for best results.. Timer, great idea.. EOS 7 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I struggl ed with focus but once I put my phone away, my focus increased a lot. EOS 7 0 15 I think that' s pretty good advice. I know which room I can do this, but just away from temptation plus having an alarm from the other room to go off after an hour or so of reading. ok, I will employ these methods more.. Thank you for sharing these. EOS 7 1 16 [Question] Of course! Is anything else on your mind? EOS 7 0 17 then hopefully after these two courses are done, I can have renewed faith and maturity after the new year and take new courses with better results.. not much, just academic pressure and how to deal with time management and being contentious.. EOS 7 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, that sounds like a great idea. It sounds like you' re really trying to help yourself grow. EOS 7 0 19 Yes I hope so, because when I was younger, I used to be great at not being distracted so much in my studies and just bang it out real quick and well with my books. and all this is also worsened by the pandemic, I am afraid, of just not having a renewed from the indoor isolation.. EOS 7 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, it' s true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood. I understand how you' re feeling, COVID has affected me negatively as well but I' m just trying to look at the bright side. EOS 7 0 21 yes it has on us all. I guess the other thing is that my city has been doing fine so far, but just the past two weeks or so has been more and more cases, so just getting stressed and depressed with that and prospects of a second shut down.. so yes, the second wave is here it seems( belatedly), but hopefully it doesn' t get worse, because I have seen worse in other places right now. EOS 7 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I would suggest taking up yoga or meditation to lessen the stress COVID has on your brain. EOS 7 0 23 so I suppose just trying to cope with that also because I get nervous having to go out for work or errands, and I also have to write my exam outside of my home.. ok. I could look into that. I work out in general, but have been slacking off on those ever since the pandemic started this year.. EOS 7 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I' d recommend wearing a mask whenever you go out to lessen the chance of you contracting anything. At the moment, it' s all we could do. EOS 7 0 25 yes and I have been and will continue to do that.. EOS 7 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s great! EOS 7 0 27 But aside from these stressors, I think I have a better idea now on how I should proceed, starting today. EOS 7 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s amazing, I' m glad I could help put your mind at ease. EOS 7 0 29 not that I haven' t, but just with more renewed faith and having fresh priorities in my head.. yes thank you very much for listening and understanding with my issues.. EOS 7 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] Of course, sometimes we all just need to talk to someone.
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday? EOS 6 0 2 I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I' m too scared to do anything about it as I don' t want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can' t help it. EOS 6 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through. EOS 6 0 4 Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I' m a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self - respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it. EOS 6 0 6 What happened out of interest when you had the conversation? EOS 6 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist. Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more. Since that time, he denies everything.
0 0 0 Hello. My name is Spike. What is yours? Is anyone there? I feel kind of sad and rejected that no one is answering. Is this part of the task? EOS 0 1 1 [Others] oh no i' m sorry i left you waited. please tell me your problem. EOS 0 0 2 I' m trying to make money on MTurk and starting a YouTube channel. Money is a big concern for me. EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] We are on the same boat. Do you have any other jobs? EOS 0 0 4 No. That' s my only income right now. It has led to a real crisis of self confidence to me. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you considered applying for a job or trying uber drive/ eats?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello, how may i help you today? EOS 2 0 1 hi. I am not sure I offended my close friend, I' m scared, he will see pictures of the car I bought for my wife today on my status. actually, I have initial plan to get the a as a birthday gift for my wife before he came to ask for the money. EOS 2 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so you are scared your friend will get mad at you for buying your wife a car after he came asking for money from you? is that correct? EOS 2 0 3 I don' t know how to explain the matter, why I can' t borrow him the money. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] Have you talked to him recently? EOS 2 0 5 yes, you are on l ine with me. yes. EOS 2 1 6 [Question] Has he said anything about the car? EOS 2 0 7 no, he saw the post of the car on my status, but he did' nt say anything. EOS 2 1 8 [Question] do you think he is mad at you?
4 0 0 hi. hello!!??!!?? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] hello. EOS 4 0 2 hi. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I apologize I was having a sneezing fit! What is on your mind today? EOS 4 0 4 oh no. i hope its not covid!. my friends aunt is in the hospital with double pneumonia from covid. EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] No, cats and out of claritin. oh my, that is horrible! EOS 4 0 6 i hear ya. just bought some claritin this morning for allergies. I agree. at least she is responding to the treatments in the hospital. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That' s great to hear she is responding! EOS 4 0 8 I was happy to hear it too. I' ve been extra careful not to get it cuz of my parents. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] ah, are they elderly or have a weakened immune system? EOS 4 0 10 elderly. dads doctor told me not to meet friends in person cuz i could pass it onto him. EOS 4 1 11 [Others] gotcha. you must live with them to help them out!
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one. EOS 4 0 16 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. What else can I do besides meditation? EOS 4 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds? EOS 4 0 18 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. Candles are much better for me. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil. EOS 4 0 20 I haven' t heard of that website before. I' ll have to check it out. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships. EOS 4 0 22 Well, I haven' t been in a long - term relationship like this before.. My past relationships were all in high school, and they only lasted a few weeks or months at a time. I really cared for this one, and we were together for so long. EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] I feel obligated to help during Christmas because I had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts. EOS 4 0 24 You had a fight with your partner? I' m sorry, it' s the worst when people fight over what' s supposed to be something nice. EOS 4 1 25 [Question] What was the fight over? Food? Money? Sex?
1 0 0 I' m having issues with my parents. You can say we are having a conflict. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] What kind of issues do you think you are having? EOS 1 0 2 well they won' t allow me to date this girl i met online.. They told she' s bad news. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today. Have you tried talking to you parents about why she is" bad news"? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, i tried but it won' t get through their head. There are so old school. They want me to date someone close to my age. is 15 year difference too big of a gap? EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] The basic problem is that your parents believe that 15 years is too large of an age gap between you guys. Is there any other reasons your parents dissaporve of her? EOS 1 0 6 They told me she' s gold digger. Yes i come from money but hey this girl is the one.. EOS 1 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You believe that the girl is not a gold digger, but instead you guys like each other for who you are. Money is not an issue for you guys? EOS 1 0 8 nope not at all. hmm well she does ask to use my credit card alot. my parents foot the bill.. EOS 1 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps you should try to talk to your parents around this fact. For example, if money is the problem for your parents, you can set some rules. LIke you can set an allowance for how much money you can use each week. EOS 1 0 10 Ok, i will talk to them this weekend. what' s better on the phone or in person? EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you want a better communication, I believe in person will be best. EOS 1 0 12 hate talking to my parents face to face, all they do is yell and i get frustrated. EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I apologize and I do agree it is sometimes difficult. Perhaps it will be better to talk to them with another person present.
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing. EOS 6 0 8 Yeah, people don' t know that just because my two friends go" Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two( so - called) friends? EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] definatly not... have you tried explaining your situation to them? EOS 6 0 10 No, they don' t know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID - 19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time? EOS 6 0 12 I might be able to do that. EOS 6 1 13 [Others] unfortunatly it is right now very comen this situation, so no shame for that, EOS 6 0 14 Well, I used to donate a LOT in year' s past. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] a lot of times donating time to help organisatiosn is more valuable then money. EOS 6 0 16 Great point. EOS 6 1 17 [Others] times and situations change so thats ok. EOS 6 0 18 My friends may like to know that I am trading time.... instead of donating money. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i worked for a non profit and the biggest struggle was to find volunteers to help out. EOS 6 0 20 Yes, you make a good point. EOS 6 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I feel that is a great donation and if they do not like that tell them money is easy to give time not. EOS 6 0 22 The proble is that some people just want to shame people without knowing their plight. EOS 6 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, true, we need to stay above them then in all actuality we don' t know what goes on behind closed doors in their life. sometimes people like that reflect. EOS 6 0 24 I need to think of others ways to contribute that won' t have my friends hating on me. I have pride, too. EOS 6 1 25 [Others] BUt it should be what you want not what your' freinds want. you should be proud of yourself. EOS 6 0 26 Yeah...... EOS 6 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hopefully next year will bring better things and maybe even a better friend that does not judge into your life. EOS 6 0 28 The problem is that I am not sure it my friends are going to believe me; I am a well - to - do individual. We can only hope for a better 2021. Not sure how quickly the markets rebound.... EOS 6 1 29 [Others] well if they do not believe you as well you might really need to rethink your friendships and the meaning in those so called freind ships. hopefully soon for all of us, but hold on to the thought of being healthy. EOS 6 0 30 Well, I usually go to their get - togethers. Both of my friends are well - to - do. EOS 6 1 31 [Others] I am hoping you will find the right solution. EOS 6 0 32 Well, you have been helpful. Thank you. Good bye. EOS 6 1 33 [Greeting] thanks I wish you all the luck and health. good bye. EOS 6 0 34 Happy Holidays. EOS 6 1 35 [Providing Suggestions or Information] same. you need to end the chat.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 0 0 2 Just feeling sad. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad? EOS 0 0 4 Not being able to leave the house with Covid. plus my hours were cut at work. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut. What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time? EOS 0 0 6 Yes it sucks. I live alone now so there really hard sometimes. I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos. Nothing productive. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it' s not the same as face to face. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I have one close friend that I talk to every now and then. Its not like it use to be. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That' s still a win. EOS 0 0 10 We used to be able to go out and have a few beers together.. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. Keep that connection. It' s not going to be the same due to the circumstances. But at least you are seeking to keep that connection, and that is a good thing. EOS 0 0 12 I hope that this vaccine thing is reason and we can get back to the norm.. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it' s not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest. EOS 0 0 14 Good idea.. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well. But I am hoping they get it right, and not just rush to get something out there that may or may not work. EOS 0 0 16 I like to do home repairs. Maybe I can find a group for that. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway. EOS 0 0 18 Do you use any other social media for connecting with new people. EOS 0 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I use Facebook, Instagram, and sometimes TikTok. You should do mini videos on easy things to DIY on TikTok. EOS 0 0 20 True. I have to change out a few old style electrical plugs. Maybe I can do something on that? EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] right! That is a great idea!
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave? EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad. EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more. I feel that everyone must know that I' ve been dumped and be laughing at me. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time. EOS 1 0 10 I did not really have any choice though. I do not see any future for myself now that we are separated. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] do you know brene brown and her work. EOS 1 0 12 No I do not, who is that? EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her TED talk and there' s a great youtube video on empathy. EOS 1 0 14 Thank you, I will. Right now I really need some sort of emotional support. I feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i bring her up because what i sounds like is that you are feeling embarrassed because your partner made a choice that wasn' t you. in reality the choice they made wasn' t about you, it was about them. EOS 1 0 16 It is not so much that - it is that I feel that I dedicated the majority of my adult life to this relationship and now there is nothing left. EOS 1 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are left and you are enough. even if you dont feel like it right now you are enough. EOS 1 0 18 I really do not feel like it right now. What was the last fifteen years all about? I wanted to have children with him and he refused but now I hear he is expecting a baby with another woman. EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] a relationship is part of who you are. it isn' t you. EOS 1 0 20 But it is very difficult to try to strike out on my own again and I do not know if I even want to. EOS 1 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it is hard. it sucks. but the voyage through the suck is going to be better for you than you may realize right now. EOS 1 0 22 But I feel that I am facing middle age on my own and I really do not want to do that. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you have survived 14 days without a bad relationship. keep on doing that day by day and before you know it, you will be on the other side of the bad feelings. EOS 1 0 24 What happens if I just can' t ever get over it though? Right now it' s hard to see any sort of way through these feelings. EOS 1 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, middle age is scary, but there are so many things you can do. ageism is out. EOS 1 0 26 I feel I might have missed out on my chance to have a family of my own though, because I waited fifteen years and my partner would not go for that. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] please watch the cartoon animals and brene brown on youtube talk about empathy. find one of your friends who has been through the suck and let them help you find your path out.
2 0 0 Good afternoon/ evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you tonight? EOS 2 0 2 Doing great. How about yourself? EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I' m doing well how can I help you tonight? EOS 2 0 4 So, the issue I' m having is work - related. My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He' s also in the middle of testing for CP. My job requires that I be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask... but sometimes the people I am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6 - foot boundary. A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills. My son just turned 2. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you' d wish they wear a mask? EOS 2 0 6 I have. A few people respected my wishes. But one in particular stands out. A gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. He got angry at my request. In my shoes, what would you do? Because I feel like Im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol. EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don' t honor your requests? EOS 2 0 8 It makes me feel trapped. Frustrated. I would never intentionally try to put someone else in harms way and I feel like I don t.* don' t get the same courtesy. I feel frustrated because I' m REQUIRED to deal with people. I work in construction. I feel trapped because, what are my options? Continue to work..... my son gets sick and dies. His pediatrician has already warned me how deadly this could be for me. And if I quit? No money? I have a 5 year old I have to take care of too.. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before I share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue? EOS 2 0 10 I' ve spoken to my boss. He was sympathetic about it all.... At this point I' m not sure what to do. EOS 2 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Alright. Have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less? Or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family? EOS 2 0 12 Those are fairly decent ideas. The struggle for money would still be an issue if I worked part - time. And I doubt I could find a better job at this particular time. With that being said, I didn' t think to see if the boss would let me work in the office for a bit. I know my fellow employees would respect my wishes. Any other suggestions? EOS 2 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] We are going through some really tough times right now and I think that most people are very sympathetic. Especially for those who are in your shoes. Our children are our top priority and seeing them sick hurts us more than anything. How do you feel about talking to your boss about working in the office for a bit until things calm down a little? Do you get paid vacation time in your job?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 I am well, thanks for asking. I am doing some studying and taking a break now. Just to talk about some of the feelings, thoughts, and stresses. The big thing on my mind now is the pandemic. And it' s the start of the second wave in my city.. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand what you are going though, indeed it is tough times.
0 0 0 I am really feeling the loneliness of the season and being isolated. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Good evening. EOS 0 0 2 Good evening. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just so I understand, the holiday season is making you feel alone and isolated. EOS 0 0 4 Yes as well as the virus. Are we out of time. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Is there anything in particular about the holidays that is bothering you? EOS 0 0 6 Just no family around. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I am also far away from my family for the holidays, so I know how hard that is. EOS 0 0 8 The virus this year does not help. EOS 0 1 9 [Others] Not at all.
3 0 0 Hello. Hello? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hey how are you doing?. EOS 3 0 2 Doing alright, thanks. Yourself? EOS 3 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing fine, thank you.. EOS 3 0 4 Good to hear. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] What brings you here today?
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday? EOS 6 0 2 I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I' m too scared to do anything about it as I don' t want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can' t help it. EOS 6 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through. EOS 6 0 4 Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I' m a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self - respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it.
0 0 0 I am very worried about losing my job. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello - How are you today? EOS 0 0 2 Anxious. I think my boss wants to fire me. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so sorry you are worried about losing your job. I have been in your shoes before. Why do you think your boss wants to fire you?
3 1 0 [Question] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I' m a little bummed because my friend is not only a junkie but he got arrested last week. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ouch! Your friend got arrested for drugs last week? EOS 3 0 3 He got arrested for stealing to fund his addiction. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I had a neighbor who was doing meth, and he got arrested, and that actually saved his life. He had to get sober and look at what he was doing. There is a hard line between helping a friend who is addicted and actually enabling them. Have you ever heard of this? EOS 3 0 5 Sadly my friend has been arrested a few times, spent time in prison, and is fully locked in his lifestyle. He' s such a great person, very funny, nice, but he is lost. EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It can be very hard to watch a loved one destroy their lives. Has anyone every discussed an intervention? EOS 3 0 7 He has alienated all of his friends, including me. I was the last one holding on. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] My husband and I actually have worked with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. We are retired now, but still volunteer. Sometimes we have to let go of our loved ones - they have to hit rock bottom. Very hard to do, but unless they see their behavior as destructive, they don' t want to change. EOS 3 0 9 I agree, I' m afraid that' s what I have to do. Another one of our mutual friends passed away recently to an overdose. I don' t want to lose another friend. EOS 3 1 10 [Others] Have you seen the serenity prayer? Knowing what to do, what not to do and accepting life really is a great thing to ask God for. We can' t change others. Yet you have to find a way to have peace.
2 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you feeling today? EOS 2 0 1 Hi. I' m feeling okayish. EOS 2 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest. EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely. I recently broke up with my girlfriend. We had been together for more than 3 years. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] What happened that made you guys break up? EOS 2 0 5 She said that she simply wasn' t in love anymore, and that she didn' t have the same feelings she did at the beginning. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have also had this situation happen to me. Maybe it just wasn' t the right timing or she had other interests. EOS 2 0 7 She was so important for me. I feel so empty.... I Feel like I' m never finding anyone like her ever again, EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I' ve had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life. EOS 2 0 9 It' s easier said than done. At times I would rather maybe just dissapear. I have never had anyone else show romantic interest in me before. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] What is your age?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hello, thank you for signing up to listen to me. I could be better but thank you for asking. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What' s on your mind? EOS 4 0 3 I am upset about the loss of my best friend' s son dying in a car accident. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I' m really sorry to hear that. When did this happen? EOS 4 0 5 The accident was Thursday February 25th but he held on until Sunday the 28th. He was only 26 years old. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There' s nothing that can prepare you for unexpected tragedies like this. We just have to deal with them as they come. EOS 4 0 7 I understand what you are saying but that' s the problem. How to deal with such a terrible unexpected loss. I feel helpless because there is nothing I can do to make her feel better. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you' re sticking close to your friend, although it doesn' t feel like its helping. It' s my experience that when someone has experienced a traumatic loss like that, making someone feel better, at least right away, isn' t always an option. The most important thing you can do for her is just to be there for her and allow her to feel however she needs to feel right now. EOS 4 0 9 She is inconsolable..... and me also being upset is not helping matters either. You are exactly right... it' s impossible to help. That is great advice... thank you. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course. These things are tough to face on your own, so you did the right thing by reaching out. I know you want to be there for your friend as much as possible, and I think that will help you to move through grief at the same time, but just be mindful to not overextend yourself too much. You have to be there for yourself too.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 3 0 2 well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. My life is done now. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband. EOS 3 0 4 well, I cannot say it is a new start when I will be 90 in March. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Then you' ve definitely got a lot going for you if you' re 90! EOS 3 0 6 Had. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Why did he leave you? EOS 3 0 8 He wanted a younger woman. His new girlfriend is 63. He is 45. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that is more of his problem then. You deserve someone that' s better than leaving someone because of their age. EOS 3 0 10 I thought it would be nice to have a younger man when we got married. He eventually told me he just married me for my money, and was waiting for me to pass so he could inherit all of it. He said he got tired of waiting, so he moved on to someone else. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Personally, if that' s how he felt, then you' re better off. I know that doesn' t stop the hurt you' re feeling, but you are worth more than that. EOS 3 0 12 Now I am here alone. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being single does not mean you' re completely alone. There are a lot of resources to talk to someone and make friends. EOS 3 0 14 I am looking on Tinder for a new friend, but nobody wants someone that is 90. I never used it before, but someone told me about it. Considering I haven' t dated in 25 years. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could you try something like Facebook or Instagram to connect with old friends or acquaintances?
1 0 0 I am so mad that I can' t see straight. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello! What is on your mind today? Oh really? Why is that? EOS 1 0 2 Well, my boyfriend has cheated so many times that I cant count them. I then meet someone nice and cheat on him once and now he breaks up with me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] being mad that your boyfriend cheated is normal. being mad when dumped is normal. don' t you think you DESERVE better than he was treating you? EOS 1 0 4 Thank you! I can see that I am talking to someone who understands. I am wondering if I should beg him back?? I really do love him. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there too. Expecially with covid, it can be hard realiing you may be alone and it may be frusterating dating someone new. if you really love someone, shouldnt they love you back? did his actions show love?
3 0 0 Hello. Hello? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hey how are you doing?. EOS 3 0 2 Doing alright, thanks. Yourself? EOS 3 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing fine, thank you.. EOS 3 0 4 Good to hear. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 6 I' ve been feeling very down lately. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] That sounds difficult, Would you like to elaborate on that? EOS 3 0 8 Sure. I feel depressed about the state of the US and of the rest of the world. It' s very overwhelming.. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now. EOS 3 0 10 Yes and a lot of uncetainty. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Most definitely, I' ve also been feeling a bit overwhelmed by what' s going on. How have you been coping? EOS 3 0 12 It' s good to know others feel the way I do. I' ve been trying to keep busy and not watch the news too much. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a good strategy, all the news outlets can be very overwhelming. EOS 3 0 14 Yes with lots of conflicting information. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] What do you like to do to keep busy? EOS 3 0 16 Work, read, exercise. I' ve been going to the gym more. EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Those sound like really good coping skills. EOS 3 0 18 Thank you. I' m trying. I really don' t want to be on medication. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a personal choice you' re completely allowed to make. It sounds like you have a good foundation for building on your ability to cope. EOS 3 0 20 I am trying. I don' t want to fall deep down an emotional black hole. EOS 3 1 21 [Question] Understandable. Do you talk with a therapist or have someone you trust you like to talk to? EOS 3 0 22 Yes, my husband is very supportive but I don' t want to upset him too much so I don' t fully open up. EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s great he is supportive. Seeing an individual counselor or someone of the like can also be helpful. They' re there for just you and they have unbiased opinions. A lot are doing telehealth right now. EOS 3 0 24 I will look into the telehealth. Thank you for that recommendation. EOS 3 1 25 [Self-disclosure] You' re welcome, hopefully it can be helpful. I, myself, have used telehealth therapy recently and it' s just been helpful with all the unprecedented chaos going on this year.
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! How are you today? EOS 3 0 2 Ok I guess. I do not know how to tell my husband that I am lonely and I want out of the marriage. EOS 3 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, that sure is a heavy subject and a heavy thing to be on your mind.
3 1 0 [Question] Good afternoon how may I help you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello there. I' m suffering with increased depression and I' m not quite clear why. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately? EOS 3 0 3 No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that' s the same for everyone. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression? EOS 3 0 5 I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I' ve always had a low mood but now I' m anxious that it will continue to get worse. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again? EOS 3 0 7 Since lockdown haven' t spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don' t want this to get any worse. What if she isn' t available?. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It wouldn' t hurt to try and reach out. If she isn' t available, there are other services. EOS 3 0 9 What like support groups etc? I' m also sure this isn' t just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It' s weird and a little concerning to be honest. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app. EOS 3 0 11 I hadn' t thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it' s worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn' t available. Sometimes its good to have options. EOS 3 0 13 I' ll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues?. EOS 3 1 14 [Self-disclosure] After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety. It wasn' t until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it. EOS 3 0 15 That must have been difficult to deal with. Mental health affects so many people in so many ways. It' s good that it' s recognised these days at least. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] It was. Luckily I had my doctor to help me. Family members meant well but chalked it up to" that' s what its like to be a mom" but it is more than that. EOS 3 0 17 I think this is why it' s always best to see a professional. I really should try to reconnect with mine. EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I agree. There is a lot of well meaning advice out there, but its best to see a professional to really help you.
0 0 0 Good afternoon. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Good afternoon. how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I am not good at all. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] oh no. I am sorry, what happened? EOS 0 0 4 This pandemic is causing too much of trouble for me. Firstly pay cut and now about to layoff. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I see. This pandemic terrible. sorry to hear that. EOS 0 0 6 My company don' t want to consider any body at all. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s pretty tough. You' re like the 3rd person today who have been going through this, EOS 0 0 8 And I don' t know what to do. EOS 0 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Can they work with another company to secure you a job or can you come back to work later if you get lay off? EOS 0 0 10 I don' t even know what they will decide. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Can you talk to your boss possibly and let him know you could do other job to help your boss so that you won' t get laid off? EOS 0 0 12 This is not affecting only one person it is affecting every body in the company. Nobody know who is next. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see. If it is really likely to happen, I would brush up my resume, make it stand out, but job search can be really stressful. EOS 0 0 14 The jobs are not there any more. Many people are affecting because of pandemic. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] I see. Startimg your own business is something that could help. What do you think? Totally agree.
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 1 0 1 I could be better. How about U? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] I am doing well. Whats bothering you? EOS 1 0 3 A friend screwed me out of money and a business venture. I am no longer friends with her. We were really close before this.. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! I am so sorry that has happened to you. That must feel like such a betrayal. Can you tell me more about it? EOS 1 0 5 It does. I' ve known her for 14 years and we dated. I invested a lot of money in a business she wanted to do. She took the money and ran. EOS 1 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back. EOS 1 0 7 What do you suggest? EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Did you sign anything? or have proof of what happened? EOS 1 0 9 No. Other than the money I transferred to her. Hello? EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What was the business? It depends on your location but I' m sure just on the transaction alone that shows some kind of intent. or text messages saying it was for a specific purpose?
6 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 1 Hi there. Can you help me? EOS 6 1 2 [Question] What help you need? please can you explain. EOS 6 0 3 I did not study for a test and I very poorly. I feel ashamed! EOS 6 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] please don' t feel shame you can do it. nothing is hard if we try. EOS 6 0 5 Exactly. I did not try! EOS 6 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] so please try then you feel better. where you feel stuck in studies please can you explain. EOS 6 0 7 I just don' t feel motivated to study. EOS 6 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] from today please feel yourself that you know everything about your studies, i think then you fell better.
0 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I am good, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m doing well, but it could have been better. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] What seems to be bothering you tonight? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, my boy friend of 3 years has refused to take our relationship to the next level and I' m kind of getting tired, I don' t want to play games anymore. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don' t feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,. EOS 0 0 6 exactly, I hate to feel that I' m wasting my time. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand that, as I was in a long term relationship and I felt as though my girlfriend at the time did not want to take things to the next step and I was not happy about it.. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I love him so dearly to want to settle down with him, but if he doesn' t want that for me I would rather call it quits now than continue and be disappointed at the long run.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you had that conversation with him? I know it might be a difficult conversation to have, but it is often good to get expectations out in the open so you are on the same page with your partner.. EOS 0 0 10 Yes, sort of and he gave me the impression that he is not there yet and that was a like almost a year ago, I don' t want it to look like I' m pushing him if I try to talk to him again about it. His nonchalant attitude in not seeing the seriousness of it is killing me, I' m just not happy. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] That is tough, but sometimes people just portray things differently, for instance I am also very laid back and nonchalant about most things which can lead to miscommunications.. I don' t think it would be pushing if you haven' t had that conversation in almost a year. EOS 0 0 12 I hope you are right, just don' t want to come across as a desperate person and that' s why I' m setting myself up to call it quits if he tries to sound like he sounded the last time. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You need to know where he is so you can make a good decision for yourself! I know it is difficult, but I know you can get through it! EOS 0 0 14 You are right, that' s exactly what I' m going to do because the wait is killing me. EOS 0 1 15 [Others] Good, I am happy for you! EOS 0 0 16 Thank you very much, you' ve been a great help. EOS 0 1 17 [Others] I am glad I was able to help! EOS 0 0 18 Thanks, it was nice chatting with you. EOS 0 1 19 [Greeting] You' re welcome! If you need any more help just chat back with us again. EOS 0 0 20 no problem, take care. EOS 0 1 21 [Others] You as well!
2 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you feeling today? EOS 2 0 1 Hi. I' m feeling okayish. EOS 2 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest. EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely. I recently broke up with my girlfriend. We had been together for more than 3 years. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] What happened that made you guys break up? EOS 2 0 5 She said that she simply wasn' t in love anymore, and that she didn' t have the same feelings she did at the beginning. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have also had this situation happen to me. Maybe it just wasn' t the right timing or she had other interests. EOS 2 0 7 She was so important for me. I feel so empty.... I Feel like I' m never finding anyone like her ever again, EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I' ve had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life. EOS 2 0 9 It' s easier said than done. At times I would rather maybe just dissapear. I have never had anyone else show romantic interest in me before. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] What is your age? EOS 2 0 11 I am 25 at the moment. EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] You still have your whole life ahead of you. Some people don' t find a partner until their 40' s or even 50' s. When I left my ex I found this guy that I truly fell in love with. He is still sulking in his living room. I told him that if he didn' t move one that he wouldnt get anywhere in life. I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what I would want him to do and I think thats what your girl would want you to do as well. EOS 2 0 13 I disagree with you regarding that maybe that is what she wants me to do. I don' t think she cares about me at the slightest anymore. I was a burden for her and will probably keep being it for any woman I meet. EOS 2 1 14 [Question] Did she give you any reasons to why she wasn' t in love anymore? EOS 2 0 15 I think she wasn' t feeling physically attracted to me anymore. EOS 2 1 16 [Question] Did you ever think she maybe possibly has been cheating?
4 1 0 [Question] Good evening. What would you like to talk about? EOS 4 0 1 evening. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you feeling at the moment? EOS 4 0 3 i lost those books, I cannot even explain, how it happen. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have lost some books? Were they important to you? EOS 4 0 5 I price one of the books, Amazon said 1000. yes. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] So you have lost a book that is worth a thousand dollars? I can imagine you are feeling really bad about that. EOS 4 0 7 where will I g et almost 3 thousand dollars. It is too painful. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I do not know.. have you considered taking an extra job on the side? EOS 4 0 9 yes, i do. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to get help with finding the books? Someone could have handed them in. EOS 4 0 11 school, should just give me enough time to find the books. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you have any idea of where you lost them? EOS 4 0 13 allow me to clear myself later, it is a fucking thing. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] I am sorry, I do not understand what you mean. EOS 4 0 15 I am trying to find that out, I packed them inside one bag, may be someone carried the bag or I misplace them. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Try not to worry, it is entirely possible that someone has found them and handed them in to the authorities. You might still get them back! EOS 4 0 17 i need enough time to look for the books, but school is not ready to listen to me. EOS 4 1 18 [Question] That is really not fair of them. Is there a higher authority you can take your case to? EOS 4 0 19 you are right. EOS 4 1 20 [Self-disclosure] They really should be doing more to help you. I know how frustrating it feels to lose something valuable. I did lose a really expensive ring one time but I got it back a week later. EOS 4 0 21 yes, it is fuck giving me headache. EOS 4 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand why it would be! Please try not to worry, all is not lost. EOS 4 0 23 I just need time, I will check the CCTV of my room, and check around. EOS 4 1 24 [Greeting] That is a good idea. I hope that they have not been deliberately stolen. EOS 4 0 25 I guest so. EOS 4 1 26 [Question] Well, I hope that I have been able to offer some useful suggestions. Do you feel a bit better about things now? EOS 4 0 27 yes. EOS 4 1 28 [Greeting] Thank you for talking and enjoy your day! EOS 4 0 29 I appreciate. EOS 4 1 30 [Greeting] you' re welcome:) you have to end the conversation from your end because I can' t.
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! How are you today? EOS 3 0 2 Ok I guess. I do not know how to tell my husband that I am lonely and I want out of the marriage. EOS 3 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, that sure is a heavy subject and a heavy thing to be on your mind. EOS 3 0 4 He is not one you can talk to he usually just brushes things off. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have tried to discuss your loneliness with your husband before? EOS 3 0 6 Yes he tells me it’s just in my head and I could just go out with him, but he drinks then to much so I do not like going out with him. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] I am sure that is frustrating! Does he drink at home as well or just when you go out? EOS 3 0 8 Just when he goes out I do not go with him I do not drink and drive. And he hangs with some obnoxious people. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Would a date night at home with take - out and a movie just the two of you be an option?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hello, thank you for signing up to listen to me. I could be better but thank you for asking. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What' s on your mind? EOS 4 0 3 I am upset about the loss of my best friend' s son dying in a car accident. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I' m really sorry to hear that. When did this happen?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability.
4 0 0 I am so embarassed and saddened. I can not believe he cheated on me. I thought we were going to work out. I was really attracted into him and I cared for him a lot. I wanted to date him longer. Thank Goodness I did not sleep with him. What a disaster. Why are men like this? Why do they break women' s hearts? I wish there were more decent men out there that did not play around. Men can be such pigs! EOS 4 1 1 [Question] what happened? EOS 4 0 2 I met a handsome intelligent man. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how are you feeling lately? EOS 4 0 4 We dated for a month. Then out of nowhere he cheated on me. I' m so sad. I am just trying to understand what I did wrong. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s okay. we should learn from things like this. EOS 4 0 6 That' s true. It' s crazy we have to experience heart ache. To learn... EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] don' t think much and keep yourself engaged in the activities you like the most. EOS 4 0 8 Hey, that is great advice! EOS 4 1 9 [Question] can you tell me how are you before this incident?
4 0 0 I face the situation of me being sad because I thought we could let this fight go over time but instead it has lead to us breaking up. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about the fight? EOS 4 0 2 Yes, so we had a fight previously over Thanksgiving Break about how I woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. Then I pick her up to go try and get breakfast... then she starts punching me while I drive so I pull over. Then she keeps hitting me until I tell her to stop. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple. Is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else? EOS 4 0 4 It is because I do really miss her. I really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Breakups are hard, but it sounds like she was violent. EOS 4 0 6 Yeah she was a little violent. I was honestly a little scared for my life for a second but people make mistakes. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Have you talked since then?
1 0 0 Hello I am having pro\ blems with a friend. EOS 1 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so so sorry to hear that. What has been going on? EOS 1 0 2 Sometimes she is very friendly, but sometimes she is super rude. In a way that is so rude that it has never happened before by someone who I consider a friend. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh wow, it sounds like shes not a very good frined. EOS 1 0 4 As nice as she is, every once in a while show will be equally nasty. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Have you tried talking to her about it? EOS 1 0 6 Super snarky comments. Yes I have tried. But it still continues. EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried seperating from her? EOS 1 0 8 I can' t she is a colleague. So unless I want to get a new job. but she is super helpful and nice 99 percent of the time. And when I have spoken with her, the last time I was very clear with her that it was inappropriate, and it hasn' t been happening as often, but the whole situation is still very hurtful. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s so hurtful. Do others feel the same as you? EOS 1 0 10 Yes, I have heard these complaints from one other person. Do you have any ideas or other suggestions for me. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you can try talking to yoru manager next time it happens? It is hard but you can only really control yourself, so you need to try to emotionally distance yourself from when she is terrible. You seem like a good persn. EOS 1 0 12 That is a good idea to talk to a manager. but there is no avoiding working with her because of the nature of my job. but that is an option that I didn' t considerr before so thatnk you for your insight. Thank you that is very nice. Let me know if you have any other ideas as well. EOS 1 1 13 [Self-disclosure] Of course!! managers are erally helpful. I had a similar sitation with a coworker two years ago and the head of my group really helped me clear it up.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Much better than normal, even though the stock market is down. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Are you an investor? EOS 0 0 3 I am a student that tries to put as much money into as possible. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand the struggle with being at that stage in life. Has this affected you negatively? EOS 0 0 5 No the stock market really doesn' t cause stress for me, mostly just small things that I think my brain overreacts to. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] What sorts of things? EOS 0 0 7 Kind of a variety of things. I typically get bad anxiety after a night of going out. So I am trying to cut out drinking. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety? Do you suffer from anxiety when you do not drink ever? EOS 0 0 9 Sometimes but I think the root from them comes from when I do something while I' m drinking. Not that I do anything bad, but I just don' t like not remembering things. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] So you would say that you drink to the point of blacking out? Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you' ve had a reasonable amount of alcohol? EOS 0 0 11 I used to black out a lot, but I have tried to control it by cutting the former amount of drinks I consumed in half, if I do choose to go out. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I have drank to the point of blacking out several times in my life mostly when I was younger and I found that it either came from a certain type of alcohol or mixing different types. Have you noticed it could be related to that or simply the amount of alcohol you are drinking?. EOS 0 0 13 It is typically the amount I' m drinking, but cutting out drinking as a whole has probably helped me the most. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Certainly making sure that you only drink a certain amount like a couple drinks of beer or only a shot of harder drinks might alleviate this or refraining from mixing drinks. Sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep... the amount you drink. Do your friends encourage you to drink more? EOS 0 0 15 They don' t necessarily attempt to get me to drink more in volume, but I do have to tell them I' m not gonna go out for the night. EOS 0 1 16 [Question] Are they okay with it when you decline? EOS 0 0 17 Yes after one or two statements they give up.. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay so they ask you a couple of times and then they move on. That' s good that they don' t push you too much. Certainly keep with it if not drinking helps you to not make bad decisions. I' m sure you have other interests in life that maybe you could drag your friends out to enjoy so that might help... sober fun! Also if you find that you' re struggling with not drinking that might be a time to look for support. Maybe see a therapist as there may be psychological reasons you can not refrain from drinking. Maybe look into a group like AA or something similar to share your struggles with others. EOS 0 0 19 Thanks for the ideas and the help, have a good day. EOS 0 1 20 [Greeting] You have a good day as well!.
1 0 0 Hi. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello though, how has life been treating you lately? EOS 1 0 2 It' s been a pretty crazy year. I' m mostly bummed because of my work. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It has been a really weird year hasn' t it? Don' t worry, I think it' s been the same for all of us. Would you like to tell me more details? EOS 1 0 4 Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else' s pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss( the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That really sucks! I can understand why you are angry and anxious about this and you have every right to be!. Are there any official routes that you can use to complain? EOS 1 0 6 I work in supply chain and I see the actual sales numbers and realized 4 months ago that we were actually on track to exceed our plans, even with the covid reductions. a few weeks later I heard him tell our sales director to keep the numbers artificially low so that they will both get their bonuses. I don' t think so... He' s the VP there isn' t anyone I can go to above him. EOS 1 1 7 [Others] That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint?. It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this. EOS 1 0 8 I don' t know if it is or not... I used my EAP benefit through work where you can talk to a councilor for free( 5 visits) and they said that it' s unfortunate but they didn' t think it was illegal. EOS 1 1 9 [Others] I am very sorry to hear that, that sounds extremely unfair to me. Have you considered looking for another job? I realise it' s a very difficult time to be looking for work right now though. EOS 1 0 10 yeah, it' s tough.. I don' t know if anyone is hiring. because of the timing like you mentioned. I' ve looked a little bit though. EOS 1 1 11 [Others] I really can' t wait for this year to be over! It' s been so awful. Do you suppose anyone at all has had a good year? EOS 1 0 12 haha I don' t know... I' m sure someone has... heck the VP is getting a Bonus... so I' m sure he' d say he' s having a good year. EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well yes fair point! Us poorer people are not doing very well though! Have you tried to talk with any of your coworkers about this? I would suggest that it might help.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 I' m good. How about you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Very little to complain about today. What brings you here?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 I' m good. How about you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Very little to complain about today. What brings you here? EOS 3 0 3 Just want to talk some random stuff basically just want a companion. EOS 3 1 4 [Others] How' s the weather where you are? EOS 3 0 5 Still pretty cold and dry in here, how about there? EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Exactly the same. What are you doing to stay warm? EOS 3 0 7 Just in my long pajamas with heater. I don' t really know what to do anymore, I am just lazy on everything. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well you' re resourceful at staying warm, at least. You mentioned wanting a companion, are you living alone? EOS 3 0 9 not really I' m living with my family but I don' t really talk to them anymore I' m just in my room all day. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Is it the stress of the pandemic getting to you& your family, or something else? EOS 3 0 11 It' s something else. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Can you share? EOS 3 0 13 Just a fight from years ago and I decided to not talk to them anymore.. EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] That' s completely your decision, but it can bring us down at times. What are you doing to stay positive during these crazy times in the world? I know you mentioned feeling lazy. Sometimes I make a list of things in the morning that I want to accomplish. Even if I get one done, it' s a win.: -) EOS 3 0 15 I talk to my friends online, play games, watch movies, etc. I know, I should find a productive hobby. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] A hobby could be another outlet for you in addition to talking to your friends online. You don' t have to put too much pressure on yourself for it to be productive. What hobby ideas do you have? EOS 3 0 17 Like painting or learn new skills online like coding, anything that can improve my human capital. EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What a great idea about learning new skills. It would be a great investment of your time, as well as improve your human capital. Win - win. Can you make a plan to research some places where you can sign - up for a coding class? Maybe research the next few days, and commit to starting in the nest 2 - 3 weeks? You would also meet others like yourself online also trying to learn a new skill. EOS 3 0 19 I have a book, I mostly research in online if I can' t understand it fully or watch youtube tutorials. EOS 3 1 20 [Others] Then you already have a plan. I like it. It' s good to have something to focus on. When is your goal to finish the book? EOS 3 0 21 A month maybe, idk depends on how much I can handle it. EOS 3 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know you can handle it. You speak very well and I just think you need a touch of motivation. We all do! Come back and talk after you finish your next chapter? EOS 3 0 23 I hope I don' t get lazy this time and fully commit on this, thank you for the encouragement. Sure, nice talking to you. EOS 3 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You as well. You are in charge on what you commit to, Just make sure you create goals that are simple, measurable and timebound. I look forward to speaking to you next time.
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? EOS 1 0 22 He' s a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly. EOS 1 0 24 But maybe I deserved it. EOS 1 1 25 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly.
1 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 1 0 1 I am just a little angry. My mother and I had another blow - up. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother?
0 0 0 Hello. My name is Spike. What is yours? Is anyone there? I feel kind of sad and rejected that no one is answering. Is this part of the task? EOS 0 1 1 [Others] oh no i' m sorry i left you waited. please tell me your problem. EOS 0 0 2 I' m trying to make money on MTurk and starting a YouTube channel. Money is a big concern for me. EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] We are on the same boat. Do you have any other jobs? EOS 0 0 4 No. That' s my only income right now. It has led to a real crisis of self confidence to me. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you considered applying for a job or trying uber drive/ eats? EOS 0 0 6 I have. But I have health conditions that would mean Covid - 19 would be very risky for me to get. So, I' m trying to work online. I' m trying to stay encouraged. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand how you feel, it' s tough not being able to work and earn much money. However, you are doing your best right now and should feel proud of yourself.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How are you tonight?
4 1 0 [Question] Hey there, what' s going on today? EOS 4 0 1 Hello. It is a fine day, how about yourself? EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] It really is! I am just taking in the fresh air in the backyard. EOS 4 0 3 That is awesome. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Thanks! What is going on in your neck of the woods?
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 2 I have been better. I had a rough semester in school.. EOS 6 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So things haven' t been going well at school. I think a lot of people are going through these days. EOS 6 0 4 It was alright at first but I failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade. EOS 6 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m sorry to hear that. That' s a heck of a situation to be in. Is there anything you can do? Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock? EOS 6 0 6 Yes, I already tried to appeal my grade. EOS 6 1 7 [Question] And the teacher wouldn' t budge? EOS 6 0 8 Sadly, no. I think they were too busy to really take a long time to discuss it or work with me. EOS 6 1 9 [Question] Was this for a course that was required for a major?
4 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 4 0 2 I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age? EOS 4 0 4 He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough, both for you and him. I know it' s meaningless to tell you not to be sad, however, you can think that he' s not in a better place. EOS 4 0 6 I presume you mean now and not not;). Though I simply am not a believer. It just made me think how meaningless life was.. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn' t it? I sometimes think it' s meaningless too. EOS 4 0 8 I do not really know what to do about my feelings. They are not going away. EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I feel you, coping with losing your loved ones is never easy. In fact, it' s confusing when you grieve and even when you recover and move on. EOS 4 0 10 Do you think that people ever really recover from a significant bereavement? I think that what you said there was very wise. Maybe it' s worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened.. there is guilt that comes with that. EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t think people can completely get over that, you just get used to the pain of not having them around.

EOS 4 0 4 Lately, my friends started to make jokes about my face being ugly. They even called my face as flat as a pan! What should I do? I see them everyday on the bus. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried confronting them and asking why they are being bullies?

EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you are very handsome! They could just be jealous. EOS 4 0 8 Haha I would hope so. Still though, it makes me want to avoid them when I go to school on the bus. What do you think I should do then? EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I understand, school was tough for me too. I suggest you tell them to knock it off or you can sit somewhere away from the bus. EOS 4 0 10 Should I just beat them up with my backpack. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No, beating them up will only get you in trouble and that won' t help. EOS 4 0 12 There' s another bus route. Should I just take that instead. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that could be a good idea if it' s not too far out of your way. EOS 4 0 14 I think I will. Their comments make me very insecure. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could also tell a teacher what is happening. They will help you out. I bet you are handsome! Don' t let it get to you.

Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 3 I am feeling resentful towards my husband for quitting his job, and my son for being the reason that he quit his job.. My son' s behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us. EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband' s loss of work and your son' s loss of his job is entirely understandable. EOS 3 0 5 I have a hard time not dwelling on the negative things going on. It' s hard to see anything positive or feel hopeful for the future. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and I understand the added stress that can cause in your household. That is a really difficult position to be in. EOS 3 0 7 My son is very defiant and argues with us about everything we try and get him to do, but he expects us to give him money for fun things that he wants to do when he isn' t willing to work or even help out around the house. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Regardless of what your husband' s actions are and your son' s, could you possibly make the time to do things to support yourself, that even momentarily would provide you with some positive feelings? EOS 3 0 9 I try to go for a run every night, that does help.. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard emotionally, so I am sorry you have to deal with your son' s behavior.

Have you talked to them about the money and returning it? EOS 1 0 6 Yes, i am very very upset. What would you do in my position? Yes, she just sounded non - comittal, saying that she will return it when she can. EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. It is a financially difficult time for us all. I am wondering if your friend might be upset and embarrassed that they can not pay you back immediately? Have you asked her if she could even afford some sort of small payments? EOS 1 0 8 Yes, i asked her how we could restructure the payment in her favor because i understand how difficult it is for everyone right now but she did not answer. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Were you speaking on the phone or in person? Is this a financial burden for you? Would you consider this person a good friend? Would you be sad if they were not in your life anymore? EOS 1 0 10 We were speaking on phone because i wanted to set up a physical meeting where we could discuss the logistics. Yes, it is a financial burden because this is money i was saving for a venture. EOS 1 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] That is very difficult. It is hard to judge things on the phone. EOS 1 0 12 Yes, this is a really close friend from way back and i would be devastated to lose the friendship. It is difficult to judge on the phone yes, which is why i wanted a physical meeting but she snapped at me and said that she will just pay me when she can. EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I see. I am very sorry about that! it is very difficult when a friend betrays your trust like that. EOS 1 0 14 Yes, very difficult. EOS 1 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing what you can. It is very nice of you to have been this patient. EOS 1 0 16 How do you suggest i shoulp proceed? EOS 1 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is the friendship more important than the money? That is what it came down to for me. EOS 1 0 18 And you chose what? EOS 1 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you can not get her to meet with you, perhaps it might be time to seek advice from a lawyer? That is providing that you are willing to possibly lose a friend.

The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin? EOS 4 0 3 I have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It first began a couple of weeks ago. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I am sad and anxious about the coronavirus.

EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What has you worried? I know right now... its a hard time for so many people. I have struggled with my own anxiety the past few weeks. EOS 0 0 5 Sorry about that. This is about my relationship. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah.... relationship worries can be so draining and emotionally exhausting. I can understand that. In your relationship, what has happened to create your worries? EOS 0 0 7 I trusted my spouse but eventually disappointed. She got a jot in another town and she utilize the opportunity to be sleeping around. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine how a break in trust has made you feel. I know a break in trust is always very difficult to process. EOS 0 0 9 I am planing to get married next year but things has changed now. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Oh I am sorry to hear that. Have you had a conversation with her about her actions and how they have made you feel?
1 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How may I help you today? EOS 1 0 1 hi. I am stressed with my 25 year old moved back from NYC.. My boyfriend and I have a home and my son does not like him. EOS 1 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that i can understand how you must be feeling. Why does your son not like your boyfriend? EOS 1 0 3 He is going back to school and I am supporting him in that. The problem is that my boyfriend thinks my son should speak to me more respectfully. He gets upset when my son is swears and shows anger to me. EOS 1 1 4 [Question] Have you talked to your boyfriend about how you are feeling?
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? I' d love to chat with you! What' s been on your mind? EOS 3 0 1 oh hello. I' m having problems with friends - or more precisely the lack of them. I don' t have any. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see. You feel as though you don' t have any friend' s currently? I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It' s so hard to see people and keep relationships right now. EOS 3 0 3 Well it' s more that I think I' ve never had friends. Not anyone I can confide in or laugh with. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a really hard thing to be going through. I' m sorry to hear that. Do you have any really close family members that you are able to confide in? EOS 3 0 5 I don' t think I' d want to let them know how unhappy I am to be honest. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Oh I see. Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn' t have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out! IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it' s 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do. I actually found a couple close friends through apps like that. Have you heard about those or looked into them? EOS 3 0 7 I' ve never heard of friendship apps to be honest. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah! They are a really good way to connect with people that you share a lot of similar interests with.. But it sounds to me that you are pretty overall sad right now. You don' t want family to know about how sad you are. Do you think it' s more than just feeling like you don' t have any friends? EOS 3 0 9 I' d really like someone local though, someone who I could meet up with face to face and who knew my town. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] On most of the apps, it connects you with people in your town! people close by. EOS 3 0 11 I don' t know if it' s more than that. What do you mean? The problem is that I lack the courage to go out and meet people. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Well personally, I have struggled with putting myself down a lot and blaming myself for things that I shouldn' t blame myself for. You shouldn' t blame yourself for not having the courage to go meet people, or blame yourself for not having any friends! And if that is what you are struggling with, then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you! You can create those bonds and connections with people close by to you on there first, and then when you feel comfortable enough with them you can meet up. That way it' s less awkward to hangout with someone you don' t really know. EOS 3 0 13 oh you mean chat online first, before actually meeting in person? EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, that is what is great about those friendship apps. You can get comfortable with them before you hangout:)
4 1 0 [Question] how are yo. EOS 4 0 1 Good how are you. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] ok. thanks for asking. what on your mind. EOS 4 0 3 Just been having a rough time.... recently broke up with my girlfriend. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] sounds hard. are you doing anything to help. EOS 4 0 5 Trying to avoid thoughts about her, but every where on social media she is posting about her new guy. It is hard to escape the sadness. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow. in our connected world it is hard to get away. do you want to tell me how it happened. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah it is. Well we have been having trouble staying closely connected since the lockdown. We tried to make time for one another, but it has been tough. I was the one who broke things off because I know longer felt much love coming from her. I felt neglected and I thought a break up was the best solution. I did not think she would pick up a new guy two weeks later. I was not prepared to deal with this kind of pain and it hurts. EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It was wise of you to know your feeling towards the relationship and make a mature decision for the both of you. During this pandemic too. that must have been even harder.. EOS 4 0 9 Yeah it has been difficult and I know I will make it through. It is just difficult to get through break ups these days. Unless you disconnect you can' t avoid the other person. EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] that' s a good idea. Have you thought about disconnecting? EOS 4 0 11 Yeah I was thinking of maybe organizing a hunting/ fishing/ camping trip with my buddies over winter break. That could help get me out of the digital world and would help me spend quality time with my friends. EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] nothing better than the outdoors wit h some friends. Fresh air can really clear the mind.

Do you mean that you are not on good terms with him? EOS 0 0 11 Its off and on. Some days are better than others.. I think its just the weather. Its cold. Gloomy that doesn' t help either. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I can understand that. It' s been cold and gloomy over here and my whole family has been in a bad mood. It seems like a little thing, but I find that taking Vitamin D supplements when the weather is bad helps me not to get depressed. EOS 0 0 13 I am just ready for 2021. It has been a scary year all around. Hmm, Maybe I should try that.. EOS 0 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Yep. Me too. I' m ready for all of this mess to be over. EOS 0 0 15 Vitamins cant hurt anyone. I just hope 2021 is better for everyone. EOS 0 1 16 [Question] How important is it for you to be able to work right now? Does your husband make enough money to pay the bills and make sure you have somewhere to stay? EOS 0 0 17 Yes, it is more an independence thing. I hate having to rely on him. Our relationship is not stable. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] I can understand that. I am sorry. Was it different when your children were younger? What has changed? EOS 0 0 19 Thank you for chatting with me. I think I will try the vitamin trick. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] Okay. One thing - - Would it be all right if I write you a Christmas card? If you would rather not give out your name/ address, I totally understand.

EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it? EOS 4 0 3 Yes, I think that might make me feel better. I really have no one to talk to because my family and friends didn' t like him so they think this is for the best. EOS 4 1 4 [Greeting] Ok. I am happy to listen..

0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Nice to meet you Jim, I am doing well. Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 3 I really appreciate your time Yes. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What is on your mind? EOS 0 0 5 I have been retired for over 2 years and would like to return to the workforce, part - ti me. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are thinking of going back to work? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, It would help us greatly. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have the right idea already. EOS 0 0 9 There are plenty of jobs and not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will find something suitable if you keep trying. EOS 0 0 11 Thanks What do you mean? Yeah, I know this but I don' t feel it.. EOS 0 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] You may feel a little apprehensive to get started. EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, I am. I know I can do it. Not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have been in the same position before and came out successful in the end. EOS 0 0 15 Wow, That' s great. How did you start?. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I just decided. EOS 0 0 17 What gave you the strength to go forward? I have this nervousness about getting rejected.. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing little things every day.
3 1 0 [Question] Good evening! What can I help you with tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I am dealing with pandemic depression. We are completely isolated. Can' t see friends, family, hug grandkids... EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] That is extremely understandable. The pandemic is an event no one was prepared for, and it has cause unforseen upheavals.. That is a tough situation, being isolated physically from those that you love. I' m sorry you' re going through that. EOS 3 0 3 It' s been going on for months with no end in sight. EOS 3 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are you at least able to maintain contact through text and video chats?. EOS 3 0 5 How do you deal with it? Yes, some video chats, but not the same. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, I make sure I continue to maintain my relationships as well as possible through the avenues I have available. It is definitely not the same, but it' s what we have at the moment. Personally, I try to maintain a routine. First hour after I wake up is coffee time, coffee and social media scroll time. EOS 3 0 7 Then there is my wife. She is very paranoid about the virus. She sanitizes the house even though no one comes in it. Bitches at me. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] That sounds very stressful, I' m sorry to hear that.. EOS 3 0 9 I appreciate your concern. It helps to have someone to vent to. Is this going to end soon??? EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I definitely cannot answer that. As long as people keep valuing one another though, we will get through it.. EOS 3 0 11 That sounds really good. I do value her, just not the paranoia. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course, that' s understandable..
3 1 0 [Question] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I' m a little bummed because my friend is not only a junkie but he got arrested last week. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ouch! Your friend got arrested for drugs last week? EOS 3 0 3 He got arrested for stealing to fund his addiction. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I had a neighbor who was doing meth, and he got arrested, and that actually saved his life. He had to get sober and look at what he was doing. There is a hard line between helping a friend who is addicted and actually enabling them. Have you ever heard of this? EOS 3 0 5 Sadly my friend has been arrested a few times, spent time in prison, and is fully locked in his lifestyle. He' s such a great person, very funny, nice, but he is lost. EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It can be very hard to watch a loved one destroy their lives. Has anyone every discussed an intervention? EOS 3 0 7 He has alienated all of his friends, including me. I was the last one holding on. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] My husband and I actually have worked with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. We are retired now, but still volunteer. Sometimes we have to let go of our loved ones - they have to hit rock bottom. Very hard to do, but unless they see their behavior as destructive, they don' t want to change. EOS 3 0 9 I agree, I' m afraid that' s what I have to do. Another one of our mutual friends passed away recently to an overdose. I don' t want to lose another friend. EOS 3 1 10 [Others] Have you seen the serenity prayer? Knowing what to do, what not to do and accepting life really is a great thing to ask God for. We can' t change others. Yet you have to find a way to have peace. EOS 3 0 11 Yes. I know I have to let go. I' ve punished myself trying to stay in his life. EOS 3 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] It' s very hard to lose friends to addictions. It' s epidemic in our society now. However, you can pray for them and look for ways to keep your life on track so you don' t get lost focusing on them and not where you want to go. EOS 3 0 13 all drugs are bad, but meth is a truly evil drug. It' s just rotting his soul and body. He believes he can' t stop and you' re right, letting go and just sending prayers is all i can really do now. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] very evil, I agree, I like to write out a list of things I can do to distract myself from overly being concerned, if that makes sense. Like I take time to think about them and pray for them, then I have to move on with my life, so a list helps me think of where I want to go and how to get there. Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol. My husband just got me a daytimer, and I write my goals in that for the new year, and I try to check it every day and try to focus on moving forward, because life has a way of throwing us curveballs like this, and we can' t get stuck in them.
0 0 0 Hello. Feeling low today. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it. EOS 0 0 2 I' ve been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn' t go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint? EOS 0 0 4 Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don' t have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions. EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress. EOS 0 0 6 Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products. I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. Challenging face - to - face, and I have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now. What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing. EOS 0 0 8 Thanks. It helps to know that I' m not alone. Most often, I work independently my work. Involves a lot of explaining and justification. Before we just all sat in the same room and worked together. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don' t convey the meaning 100 percent. EOS 0 0 10 So, perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues? EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would personally suggest more happy hours, in case you haven' t already done so.
2 0 0 Good evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hi, how' s things? EOS 2 0 2 Things are ok I am just having issues with the problem above. EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I am afraid that I am not able to see that.. can you tell me about it? EOS 2 0 4 Yes, so I have always done very well in school and university. I have always had A' s or high B' s. Last semester in university, I failed one of my exams. I still passed the class with an A, but for some reason, that exam haunts me and gives me bad dreams. I don' t know why it happens and it worries me. EOS 2 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - when I was sitting my final exams I constantly had nightmares about failing. Nearly thirty years on and I still do!! But - you did really very well and you passed with an A. Do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself? EOS 2 0 6 Maybe, I got a 46% on the exam( so an F) but I did all my other assignments and exams almost perfect and got an A overall. I never once failed a test in my life, and have always held myself to a very high academic degree to make my parents proud. I come from a poor family, so succeeding in life is very important to m, e. me* EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds as though you feel that academic success is the most important thing in your life, would I be right in thinking this? EOS 2 0 8 Yes you are correct. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered talking to anyone about these feelings of perfectionism? A therapist perhaps? There is a good deal of useful help and information out there for people who are struggling. EOS 2 0 10 I have not, actually. I don' t think my family can afford a therapist, especially with the pandemic raging right now. Where do you recommend going? EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Does your school have any counsellors offering help for free? Many do. I believe that there are some charities that will offer a certain number of free therapy sessions too. EOS 2 0 12 I don' t think any are available since my school is online only, also the campus i s completely closed due to Winter Break. Oh? Charities? EOS 2 1 13 [Others] Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you. EOS 2 0 14 I have never heard of such people, I am interested. EOS 2 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Really though I think that your problem is self esteem.. you should think better of yourself:) I can tell that you set yourself a very high standard but I also think that you need to be kind to yourself. EOS 2 0 16 I think you' re right, but I don' t know, I' m still scared about having the bad dreams. I often wake up 2 - 3 times at night because of them. EOS 2 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - this has been happening to me all of my life. Have you tried to take anything to help? I can recommend a hot milky drink before bed and perhaps a hot water bottle. Anyway I hope that I have been able to be of some assistance to you! Have a lovely holiday season.
2 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are we doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Okay how are you? EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Im doing great thanks. Anything on your mind today? EOS 2 0 3 Just pondering microcheating and wondering why someone who I do not like that way would be considered microcheating. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] And what do you mean by microcheating? EOS 2 0 5 It is a new thing like having a man you like that you check up on on social media even though you are in a relationship, or eating lunch with the same woman or man that you like but you don' t act on because you are married. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh i see, well i think overthinking things like that can lead to unwanted emotions. Or putting yourself in a situation with another person when you are in a relationship might mean there are other issues going on. EOS 2 0 7 Yes i see that. No nothing else going on just thinking that the definition maybe shouldn' t be as exact for the type of person that I do not talk to because of his reservations about it. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, if you are not talking to them then i see no harm. If you are talking to them with some sort of intention to for a relationship beyond friendship then i see issues arising. EOS 2 0 9 That is what I feel. I am not talking to him. I had to the other day to get in contact with someone( medical emergency) but do not call just to chat and catch up. I even unfriended him. I just want to comfort him over it but I think it is best just to never speak of him again. Comfort my fiance. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] To never speak to your fiance? If you want to continue your relationship and you do not feel you can continue a platonic relationship with this other person then that might be best. EOS 2 0 11 No I am ending my friendship with him. That is what is best. EOS 2 1 12 [Question] I think it might be as well if you cannot control it. I do have to ask though, are you happy with your Fiance? EOS 2 0 13 Yes very. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Then i 100% back you on your decision. Id take this time to focus on you too. Strengthen the bond a bit.
3 0 0 hi there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! what seems to be bothering you today? EOS 3 0 2 currently, i am living in a house with my brother, which i co own and can not afford to move out.. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Is living with your brother a bad thing? What specifically is making you upset?
0 0 0 Hello my situation is that I' m facing an enormous amount of academic pressure. EOS 0 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello. Academic work can be overwhelming at times. I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though. Could you tell me what the issue is in particular? EOS 0 0 2 It' s just a huge amount of work that I' m struggling with and a ton of exams and they give me a lot of anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming. Make sure that you try to be as prepared as you can. When you feel capable of doing well on said exams, you will feel a lot less pressure. EOS 0 0 4 Do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though? EOS 0 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have an academic councelor you can talk to?
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with this evening?. EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very depressed lately. Like a constant pressure that i don' t know exactly what it is. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I' m very sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 4 0 3 I think the days getting shorter makes it worse. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating. EOS 4 0 5 Do you have any tips on how to overcome it? EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help. I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through Instagram. I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while.. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up. I like to stay up, but when it' s time to get up i dread it. Bad cycle. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sure, that' s understandable. There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin D, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them.. EOS 4 0 9 Time is the fire in which we burn. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] Now that is intractable. EOS 4 0 11 Lol... yes it is. The pandemic heightens all our awareness of time and mortality. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes, to me, the enormity of the universe is calming to my anxiety. Being assured that I mean absolutely nothing is nice sometimes. EOS 4 0 13 And drives the civil unrest which makes me feel anxious and insecure. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] Not in a scary, better - off - dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion. I' m a flea to the universe. EOS 4 0 15 Yes i find that a strangly comforting thought. EOS 4 1 16 [Others] ... then you have to wonder, what are fleas thinking?!. EOS 4 0 17 They have the luxury of instinct without having to" think" at all. EOS 4 1 18 [Others] God, tell me more, lol. EOS 4 0 19 They just be fleas. Fleas gonna flea. EOS 4 1 20 [Others] Galaxies gonna spiral.
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing. EOS 6 0 8 Yeah, people don' t know that just because my two friends go" Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two( so - called) friends? EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] definatly not... have you tried explaining your situation to them?
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Same old.. still trying to lose weight. Already on day 20 for fasting. did not lose a single pound. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight. What kind of methods have you been using? EOS 0 0 4 I tried keto diet for 6 months, didn' t work. So now on Fasting. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are really discouraged. EOS 0 0 6 I also go to gym 2 times a week. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow! You have been trying practically everything. You are really motivated. EOS 0 0 8 Yea, very discouraged... EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Losing weight can be difficult. I' ve struggled with that many times. Have you thought of consulting a dietician or a nutritionist to help? Maybe, they would offer some new suggestions. EOS 0 0 10 I am already lucky that I can sometime able to book swimming pool close by. I considered but they said I am not overweight. EOS 0 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like they didn' t listen to your needs. And it seems like you are doing a great job exercising at the pool and employing other methods to lose weight. What is your primary motivation behind your weight loss goal? EOS 0 0 12 The added weight is putting pressure on my hips and knees.. Causing a lot of pain as well for my lower back. EOS 0 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] That' s no good. I' ll bet that is difficult to deal with. Have you thought about teaming up with a friend and going on daily walks? EOS 0 0 14 No, I have to look after the kids.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, you could also take the kids on a walk every day. That would be a healthy activity to enjoy together, and it should help burn some of their energy too.
3 0 0 Hi, how are you today? I feel really sad all the time. I don' t know why. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] hello. you feel sad, why? EOS 3 0 2 I' m not sure. I can' t find a reason. My health is fine. I have friends. I have a place to live. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] your health is fine and you have place to live but you are still sad. EOS 3 0 4 Yes, that' s right. I feel like my life is not going in the right direction. In fact, I' m not going anywhere. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] have you talked to anyone about it. EOS 3 0 6 No, not really. I don' t know what to talk about. I just feel flat. Something' s wrong. I don' t know what. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i have felt that way before but i came over it. EOS 3 0 8 How did you do that? I really need some guidance here. What do I do? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] it came to me like a mood swing for so many days but i started going to meet friends and get closer to my friends for positive vibes. EOS 3 0 10 You met with your friends? I' ve tried meeting with my friends. I feel ok when I' m with them, but then later, I feel sad again. I can' t spend all my time with my friends, of course. They have things to do. So do I. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, you have to be positive at all time and always do something that makes you happy. EOS 3 0 12 I' m trying to be positive. It doesn' t seem to work. I don' t know how to change my mood without chemicals. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you try yoga or meditating as a therapy.
1 0 0 hi there. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hi! Hope you are doing well. How can I help you today? EOS 1 0 2 I am having such a hard time falling asleep at night.... I toss and turn and cannot shut my mind off. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep. Hope I get it right? EOS 1 0 4 yes that' s right. my mind just races thinking about problems it seems. I am irritable and frustrated. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Is there a specific thing or task which is bothering you for long? EOS 1 0 6 I worry about my daughter, she has addictions. I never know if she is okay or not, she doesn' t call me very often and is hard to get a hold of. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It must be a tough time for you and is a enough reason to not getting good sleep. despite of it you should need a complete rest. EOS 1 0 8 Have you any suggestions to help me get to sleep easier? I have tried meditation, but it doesn' t seem to help much. EOS 1 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I feels like you are having less energy and feel tired due to lack of sleep. Try to follow a particular schedule and u can put soothing music before bed. It might calm you down and make you sleep. EOS 1 0 10 That' s a good idea I can try that. My bedtimes are kind of mixed up, maybe setting a particular schedule will help, I' ll try that. sometimes i go to be early, sometimes late, maybe that is screwing me up. EOS 1 1 11 [Self-disclosure] When I have sleeping problem, I take warm shower. It help me a lot. EOS 1 0 12 good idea, i could try that. EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] As far as I know if we follow a particular time to go to bed eventually We start feeling sleepy at that time or body adapt it. EOS 1 0 14 oh ok, that makes sense. i wish my daughter lived closer so i can check on her, she is in another city which makes it hard. i worry. ok well thankyou for your help. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can understand how hard it is for you. But nothing stays same. I wish your daughter will come out of it soon and wishing her success. Meditation can help you too. Before sleeping you can concentrate on your breath. EOS 1 0 16 I appreciate your suggestions and will give them a try. The warm shower sounds like a really good idea. Thankyou so much. are you a parent? EOS 1 1 17 [Others] Best wish for you! Wishing you will have a nice sleep and refresh day afterwards. EOS 1 0 18 thank you i apprecaite that, to you as well. EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I am a parent with 2 kids and can understand your situation very well.
3 0 0 I am so stressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi, what' s going on?
2 0 0 hi. EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hey! How are you? EOS 2 0 2 trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once:( EOS 2 1 3 [Question] What are these thoughts?:) EOS 2 0 4 Its so stupid. I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts just come so fast. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while. EOS 2 0 6 tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes I cant controll the thoughts or like I dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing. EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] A chemical thing, so maybe you need a counsellor, and then he can assess your problem, and everything will be alright:)
0 0 0 hey. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m good, busy. I need another job to pay more bills. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having a difficult time with your finances. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 yes somewhat. i can pay it off within 2 - 3 years without a second job. id like to pay it off faster though. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure it will take dedication and hard work, but I bet you can do it! EOS 0 0 6 I think so. Im doing mturk for a second job right now. it helps some. i don' t know about getting another job. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been in your shoes and also feel that' s a good way to add a little extra income. It can really add up if left to built and used towards a specific goal. EOS 0 0 8 I agree 100%. Been spending it on new clothes and toiletries lately to stock up for the covid shutdown. the extra money helps alot. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It definitely can help. Perhaps you could have a separate way of using some of the money to go towards some of the other bills you would like to pay off? Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns. EOS 0 0 10 i currently do that. it' s hard to have the patience to pay it off. i hate having debt hanging over my head. i like to have nice things though and they cost money. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Yes, and I have found this can be a good way to provide for the extra luxuries we like, without taking away from money that' s used towards household bills.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with this evening?. EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very depressed lately. Like a constant pressure that i don' t know exactly what it is. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I' m very sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 4 0 3 I think the days getting shorter makes it worse. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating.
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. EOS 3 0 16 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. EOS 3 0 18 That is a good point.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. EOS 3 0 20 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand.
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Greeting] hi there. How are you? EOS 1 0 2 I am so frustrated. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] May I ask why you are feeling frustrated? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, my school was closed without warning because of COVID. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand how that could make you so frustrated, that would make me frustrated too. I am waiting to hear about my school. EOS 1 0 6 Yes I don' t even know what is going to happen with finals now. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure that whatever happens, you will do well with them. Have you thought about talking to an administrator at your school? EOS 1 0 8 I hope so. But I feel like this could have been handled better. Not yet, there is a waiting list to talk to an academic advisor. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is all the more reason to be frustrated, i commend you for having to deal with that! EOS 1 0 10 Thanks. I feel like my head is going to explode though. The remainder of the semester is going to be online. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about talking to a close friend or someone you trust about these stressors?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today. EOS 3 0 2 I feel bad putting this on your shoulders, maybe you can help. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] i have big shoulders! whats on your mind? EOS 3 0 4 I' m just struggling a lot to find the motivation to do anything at all, even the most basic of things. Sometimes I get very intense feelings of sadness and just want to drop everything I' m doing, like I can' t do anything more. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] i think a lot of people are feeling that way these past few months. do you think it is covid related? not sickness, more depression. EOS 3 0 6 Yes that' s very true, depression is probably hitting people the worst right now. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] its becoming a new normal lol. EOS 3 0 8 No I' ve been fighting depression since I was probably like 12 years old, it first really hit me when I moved from where I was living all my life and lost all my friends and I was terrified. Now I' m 29. But covid definitely plays a factor. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] a few months ago i was feeling the same way. i dont have health insurance but googled and found some online docturs. i got to see a doc and get on antidepressants for less than a hundred. covid plays a factor in EVERYTHING ugh. EOS 3 0 10 So you had the therapy session online with them via webcam or you found them online first then went to see them in person. Yeah covid is doing damage in more ways than one. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] all online!:) meds shipped to my door. i love it! EOS 3 0 12 Wow that' s great. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] theres a free site called 7 cups that does free peer to peer couseling too. its good when i have a lot on my mind. EOS 3 0 14 I would have to do it in person, I don' t want people I live with to hear about all my pathetic mental problems. Oh 7 cups, I had an account there and met a really nice girl there that was helping me and she was living with an abusive family at the same time, its crazy but now I can' t access that account anymore, I' m so sad about that. I think it says the account doesn' t exist when I try to login now. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] can you make a new one? EOS 3 0 16 Sure I guess I' ll have to do that but I really wanted to get back into that account, don' t want to lose contact with that girl that was helping me. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] cerebral is that one site with the cheap docs. EOS 3 0 18 do you mean um.... cheap med? cerebral seems to be an antidepressant when i googled. EOS 3 1 19 [Others] check the website q and a. EOS 3 0 20 oh wait nevermind i spoke too soon. EOS 3 1 21 [Others] for cups maybe thers a contact you can email to try to regain access. EOS 3 0 22 Yeah definitely, I should try contacting their support to try and restore my account. EOS 3 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] they are doing so much things now, you just gotta get on google and see whats out there! i think you are going to be okay, there are definately tough times but you seem to have a grip on knowing what you need. that is great. EOS 3 0 24 Yeah, I gotta do therapy thats a must and I think it has to be in person so I can try to let some of it out with someone face to face....... but that' s going to be very hard, to trust someone and open up about everything because its not just depression. Online is convenient but its just too much going on. EOS 3 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i agree, just with all the covid crap i know it can be hard to get a face to face!:)
4 0 0 Hello. Is anyone there. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you today? EOS 4 0 2 I' m doing good. I need some advice. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] What can I help you with? EOS 4 0 4 Lately, my friends started to make jokes about my face being ugly. They even called my face as flat as a pan! What should I do? I see them everyday on the bus. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried confronting them and asking why they are being bullies? EOS 4 0 6 I did and they respond by saying that they are just joking and that I' m handsome. But it' s starting to get on my nerves because it' s all they make fun about every time they see me! EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you are very handsome! They could just be jealous. EOS 4 0 8 Haha I would hope so. Still though, it makes me want to avoid them when I go to school on the bus. What do you think I should do then? EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I understand, school was tough for me too. I suggest you tell them to knock it off or you can sit somewhere away from the bus. EOS 4 0 10 Should I just beat them up with my backpack. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No, beating them up will only get you in trouble and that won' t help.

EOS 3 0 5 My and my long term boyfriend just ended. Turns out he was cheating on me for the past 3 months with his best friend:( EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] whoa, that' s pretty messed up! how long were you together? EOS 3 0 7 Tell me about! We were planning on moving in together next year. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, I definitely wouldn' t go through with that then. Are you sure he was cheating? EOS 3 0 9 I noticed a few signs and confronted him about it. He didn’t even deny it! He wasn’t remorseful at all... it’s like he doesn’t even love me. How can you love someone yet betray the, somquiclu. So quickly** EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] did he admit to it? I would agree that he probably doesn' t feel the way you want him to. EOS 3 0 11 Not at all. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] but you know for certain? EOS 3 0 13 Yes HE ADMITTED IT. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] oh gotcha. yeah that is really messed up. how long were you two together? EOS 3 0 15 We were together for 3 years. I don’t know how he could just toss it down the drain. EOS 3 1 16 [Question] That' s horrible. Have you been able to talk to friends about it?
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 I' m sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What happened? EOS 4 0 3 My ex - boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Why did he break up with you? EOS 4 0 5 because I didn' t trust him and I was always jelous. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think you should try finding a psychologist to help your jealous.
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed! EOS 7 0 7 And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that' s one method I have used.. Thank you for your trust in me.. EOS 7 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don' t overdo it.. EOS 7 0 9 I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible. true, very true.. Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen? EOS 7 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you. EOS 7 0 11 Thanks for sympathizing and understanding.. EOS 7 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation. EOS 7 0 13 ok. That' s true and I have to do more of that. Phone is also a big distraction for me. I heard that it' s best to get it out of one' s reach for best results.. Timer, great idea.. EOS 7 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I struggl ed with focus but once I put my phone away, my focus increased a lot.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 4 1 2 [Greeting] I am good how are you.
3 1 0 [Question] hi how' s it going today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you? EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future? EOS 3 0 5 Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it' s true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online? EOS 3 0 7 Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression. EOS 3 0 9 How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] the" little black rain cloud" people? LOL I try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it' s our first. EOS 3 0 11 Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] While there is a lot to focus on that is just awful, it has really helped me to look back to the spanish flue of 1918. that pandemic was followed byt he roaring 20s. EOS 3 0 13 I know people thinking the country will collapse soon. Hard to deal with them. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The doomsday people are always around. remeber they mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012. EOS 3 0 15 I have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. Especially during the holidays. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] are you familiar with Mr. Rogers' story about looking for the helpers when things go bad? EOS 3 0 17 No but I did love that show as a kid. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Family is hard! So many strong emotions and opinions that aren' t always helpful. anyone in particular for you? EOS 3 0 19 My dad and my GF' s dad both have their own opinons on things. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people. EOS 3 0 21 Yes. I also don' t feel like the world will decent into madness, but they do not believe it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] oooh, that' s hard. are you living at home with your dad? as a mom, i can tell you that the unknown for your children is scary. often fear and lack of control come out sideways.

0 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 I am fine thank you. How are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am very well. Do you have any problems you' d like to discuss with me? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I am having trouble figuring out how to handel a situation with a friend. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah, can you give me a few more details? I am sure I will be able to help/ EOS 0 0 5 Her husband was justshot and kiled over a drug deal. He was high on drugs at the time. My dayghter and his daughter are good friends and we carpool with them every day. He was often the driver not my friend. Was he high when he was driving my daughter arround? Did my friend know he was on drugs? EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow that is a tough one - I can see why you would be concerned about it. At least, though, you can be assured that she is safe and is never going to come to any harm as a result of his driving now. EOS 0 0 7 Agreed but it is hard to not be suspicious that the mom knew something about hi actions. Yet I feel horrible that she lost her husband. EOS 0 1 8 [Others] I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it:( EOS 0 0 9 I know. I am trying to be supportive and help her with her kids but a part of me is still anxious that she may have played me. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] People can hold values that to other people seem strange. She might not have considered it wrong to be driving on drugs, even though it is.
5 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 5 0 1 am fine thank you. EOS 5 1 2 [Question] Is there anything that you would like to talk about? EOS 5 0 3 no, now am okay.

4 1 0 [Question] HI there, How are you doing today? EOS 4 0 1 Its hard for me to find a job. things could be doing better. it' s been a bad week for me. EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] I understand that, it is hard to find a job. I got terminated during the beginning of covid. EOS 4 0 3 Yea, i got laid off in July. the market has been tough. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I actually took a job at walmart just to make ends meet. Not the best situation but hey, my family can eat. EOS 4 0 5 thats good. i' m an engineer and i would like to take another engineering role. but they are hard to come by now adays. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea, would you consider doing something lesser for now just to make sure you have some income coming in? Or do you still collect unemployment at least? EOS 4 0 7 yes, i still get some unemployment which helps. i' ve done many interviews. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Thats good at least. Well, its great you are being proactive about it! I hate saying this but, just hang in there and keep moving on.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello there! How can I help you this afternoon?. EOS 3 0 1 I' m just feeling really down lately and would like to talk to someone who understands. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Feeling consistently sad is a tough place to be. I' m sorry to hear you' re going through that..
2 0 0 Good afternoon/ evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you tonight? EOS 2 0 2 Doing great. How about yourself? EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I' m doing well how can I help you tonight?
3 0 0 Hello, is someone there? EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, my name is Jonathan. May I ask who I am speaking to today? EOS 3 0 2 Hi Jonathan, I' m Keri. EOS 3 1 3 [Greeting] Hi Keri. How are you today? EOS 3 0 4 I' m feeling a little bit down today. I' ve been feeling a little bit down a lot lately. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh no. I' m sorry to hear that. What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately? EOS 3 0 6 My ex - husband is moved in with his new girlfriend. They might get married. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh Keri, that must feel awful. Was it a recent separation between you two? EOS 3 0 8 He started dating a few months after we split up. I don' t know if this is the only person he' s dated but I think so. He really moved on quick. Hi, are you still there? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Yeah I understand what you' re going through. I was in a similar position not too long ago. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. How does it make you feel that he' s trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours? EOS 3 0 10 It makes me feel like he didn' t learn anything from our relationship or like he thinks he' s better than me because he has someone new and I don' t. I' m trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good I think, but sometimes I feel really really lonely too. Like maybe I won' t ever find anyone. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you' re doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another. EOS 3 0 12 Thank you! Exactly. But it is scary. I am guessing from your name that you identify as male( please forgive me if that is incorrect), so you might not understand what it feels like to be an older woman when your ex starts dating someone a lot younger. Men only get better and more desirable with age, not so for women. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I might not understand that particular aspect, but self worth is still self worth no matter the context. I' d say try not to pay any mind to what he' s up to. The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence, but if you just focus on watering your grass( making yourself happy) then you' ll have a much more fulfilling life.

EOS 0 0 4 well, yeah. in the middle of a pandemic, and being in a new town. all of that has been really hard. and stressful. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a difficult position to be in. It is a hard time, but there' s always a way to persevere. EOS 0 0 6 yeah... i don' t know... i' m not sleeping well because i' m so worried. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I could imagine that being a constant worry. I understand how you may feel. EOS 0 0 8 thanks for trying to understand. it just seems pretty hopeless. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] No problem. I am encountering a similar situation, looking for a well suited job.

EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck. EOS 0 0 7 How did you push past that job? EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work.

EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand, but just to make sure I know what is going on fully, you are depressed in general and don' t know how to get through it..
2 0 0 Hey. I am really scared about my job prospects. I am really fearful about my job situation. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] When did this fear start? EOS 2 0 2 It has been a while. I have had fears going back to my childhood traumas. I think that the work situation has only exacerbated that. The current economic climate has really made me fearful.... not sure if I am going to be able to keep my job. EOS 2 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct? EOS 2 0 4 Somewhat. But, my fears are relevant because I don' t know if I will always have a job. EOS 2 1 5 [Question] Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job? EOS 2 0 6 Do you know what I mean? What say u? I have some, but they have their own problems to deal with. Everyone has problems. Do you know what I mean? EOS 2 1 7 [Self-disclosure] You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me. EOS 2 0 8 It is making me have flashbacks of other traumatic situations, I think I need to find a good support chain, for sure. What say u? You take alooonnng time to respond. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many counselors who specialize in this field of job security and especially during this pandemic and the falling economy, they are great support systems. EOS 2 0 10 I am having a hard time.... Ok, I will look some of them online. I need some financial planners to help as well. Many Americans are hurting. EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic. EOS 2 0 12 Any other advices? What else can you advise me on? Should I look elsewhere for jobs? I will have to try that. Maybe it can help me ease my mind. EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Since a lot of this stress is being caused by your childhood trauma, it seems like there is something that connects that job to your trauma and if it cant be disconnected, it seems like you should find another job. And I understand that is not the easiest in these times but I believe you can do it! EOS 2 0 14 It is not easy right now. That' s for sure.. I am wondering if I could do Lyft or Uber. I think a side hustle could work, perhaps? EOS 2 1 15 [Question] Do you think those jobs would help you disconnect your childhood trauma and work life? EOS 2 0 16 Do you think I am thinking rationally? I could give it a try.... Childhood traumas are tough for sure. I am a fearful person. EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Just giving it a try is what starts every journey and I am proud of you for taking that leap! EOS 2 0 18 Thanks a lot. I appreciate you support.:) I think that your advice will help. Thank you for the chat. EOS 2 1 19 [Greeting] No problem I hope all goes well for you and I hope you stay safe.
4 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello, How are you today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m really depressed. My fiance left me yesterday. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it? EOS 4 0 3 Yes, I think that might make me feel better. I really have no one to talk to because my family and friends didn' t like him so they think this is for the best. EOS 4 1 4 [Greeting] Ok. I am happy to listen.. EOS 4 0 5 I just don' t understand why someone would pretend to be happy for a year and then decide they were lying and leave. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Seems like you feel your partner betrayed you, does that sound right?. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I feel very betrayed.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is understandable. I know how you feel, may I suggest taking a few minutes to clear your head, and making a plan to talk with your friends and parents about how you feel? EOS 4 0 9 They think I should just get over it because they didn' t like him so they think I shouldn' t like him either. They' re making things worse for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] Oh I' m so sorry, sometimes family and friends don' t think about your feelings. When did this happen?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there! What would you like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 1 I am trying to be fine and you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] It may be helpful to know.. my name is Ann. I am 43 years old... and I know for myself, I enjoy talking to people when I have concerns. What is going on? EOS 0 0 3 Thank you for your concern, I am just worried. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What has you worried? I know right now... its a hard time for so many people. I have struggled with my own anxiety the past few weeks.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi like I said a bit down. EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I did not see that, I am sorry. Do you want to talk about it? It might help. EOS 4 0 3 Ohh thank you for the offer. Proscanation is my thing i guess, and this days I am paying for it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Is it affecting your work or your home life? EOS 4 0 5 Yes it affects everything. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Can you give me an example of something that has been affected recently? For instance, I had been putting off cleaning my house and then some friends dropped by without warning and I was mortified. EOS 4 0 7 I didn' t meet deadline a year back, and lost my job. Now I couldn' t even pay rents. Living with a sibling. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That sounds bad. Have you considered you might be suffering from depression? EOS 4 0 9 Probably. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You sound quite lethargic. I think you should see a GP? EOS 4 0 11 Thank you. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you feel as though life is hopeless and there is no way forward? EOS 4 0 13 No no no... me the super optimist. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] Well that is something:) What are you looking forward to? EOS 4 0 15 Will achieve my goals with proscanation or not. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] What sort of goals have you set for yourself? EOS 4 0 17 I have pills of written works, short stories, poetry novels and a few paintings, but not published yet. I might do that. EOS 4 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well that sounds very creative! You should definitely publish. EOS 4 0 19 There is always" next year" so I am waiting for it... EOS 4 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No no do it now. You might have written a best seller and not know it. EOS 4 0 21 Thanks for talking to me, very supportive. EOS 4 1 22 [Greeting] You are more than welcome. I hope you feel a little reassured now.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Nice to meet you Jim, I am doing well. Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 3 I really appreciate your time Yes. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What is on your mind? EOS 0 0 5 I have been retired for over 2 years and would like to return to the workforce, part - ti me. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are thinking of going back to work? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, It would help us greatly. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have the right idea already. EOS 0 0 9 There are plenty of jobs and not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will find something suitable if you keep trying. EOS 0 0 11 Thanks What do you mean? Yeah, I know this but I don' t feel it.. EOS 0 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] You may feel a little apprehensive to get started. EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, I am. I know I can do it. Not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have been in the same position before and came out successful in the end. EOS 0 0 15 Wow, That' s great. How did you start?. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I just decided. EOS 0 0 17 What gave you the strength to go forward? I have this nervousness about getting rejected.. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing little things every day. EOS 0 0 19 So, keep myself busy and try to ignore my nervousness? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Really adds up and helps to get the big picture moving. EOS 0 0 21 OK, so with, well, kinf0f like baby steps.... right. EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It is about making small adjustments to feed a good habit. EOS 0 0 23 Build up my confidence and not take things personally. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Building it in to your daily life will make you feel accomplished. EOS 0 0 25 Yeah, so true. EOS 0 1 26 [Self-disclosure] THis really helped me to get going in the past. EOS 0 0 27 I have a few ideas and go with my strength' s and abilities that I have already been successful in the past. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You will find those things that you know you want. EOS 0 0 29 Yeah, I like it. I guess I needed to just chat with someone and listen to myself. EOS 0 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] Always beleive in yourself!
4 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling really sad and lonely right now. My boyfriend and I broke up and it was me who wanted it but now I regret breaking up and he doesn' t want me back. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, I can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it' s too late. EOS 4 0 3 That is exactly it. I broke up with him because I liked another person but then quickly realized that I made a mistake and it' s too late. I want him back should I start calling and going to his house to beg? EOS 4 1 4 [Question] nobody knows him better than you do, right now I do not think he is in a good place either since it wasn' t his choice to end it, how do you think he would react if you started pressuring him?. EOS 4 0 5 I haven' t really thought of that yet. He has a pretty short temper actually. I know he is really mad at me so I think he might want to yell at me and get his anger out before he could start being nice to me again. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this, perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel, without pressuring him into a response. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah, that' s true. I have been secretly watching his social media and he has girls asking him out and I don' t want to let them get to him before I can get him back. I want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] you can always ask him calmly if he would like to talk, so you both have a chance to express your feelings in a safe way, with no yelling or arguing, do you think that' s something he would do?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello. EOS 2 0 1 Hello I am in need of assistance. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] I am Tom. How can I help you? How are you in need of assistance? EOS 2 0 3 Hello Tom, this is Dillon.. I haven' t been doing well in my academics. EOS 2 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I have a real talent to provide guidance to people out there in the World. Not doing well in college or high school? Are you in a trade school? Or in academia? EOS 2 0 5 In college. I started off really well until the pandemic hit. Now my family is struggling financially and it has greatly affected my academics. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Well, I went through a similar situation when a pink - eye breakout hurt my school.... I struggled financially, but took any job I could..... EOS 2 0 7 What kind of jobs did you take? EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Work part - time and go to school part - time. EOS 2 0 9 I' m trying to find a steady job. jobs that can help support both my family and my tuition. EOS 2 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest creating flyers and ask to be a dog walker. Americans love their dogs. 70 Percent of Americans have dogs. EOS 2 0 11 oh okay that' s interesting. there' s a part time job at a local library should I take it? EOS 2 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I feel that you can be great and be a good entrepreneur..... dog walking doesn' t take a lot of talent. EOS 2 0 13 thank you for that. EOS 2 1 14 [Question] How close in the library? EOS 2 0 15 the library is within the campus. EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Ok, that is good. I once worked at a library. EOS 2 0 17 you did? how was the experience? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I worked in a library many years..... EOS 2 0 19 but overall was your experience working in the library pleasant? EOS 2 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] It was quite pleasant. And the pay was decent. Plus, I got to read and research a lot. I ended up meeting my wife at the library as well. I felt good taking the job.:) EOS 2 0 21 wow! that is quite the experience Tom. I might just take the job then since it went well for you. anything to help support my family and my academics during these trying times. EOS 2 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest keeping an eye out for smart and sexy w= ladies who like going there. EOS 2 0 23 haha I' ll maybe focus on the job at hand first Tom. EOS 2 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can support your family by working at the library and reading up on higher paying jobs while there. EOS 2 0 25 that' s good advice. thank you for listening to my situation and giving me advice Tom. EOS 2 1 26 [Reflection of feelings] I feel that the local libraries are great options for working and learning. I met my future wife while working at the library many moons ago. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
3 0 0 I am feeling depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about your feelings? EOS 3 0 2 I feel lost and lonely, i do not know what to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] When did these feelings come about. EOS 3 0 4 They came about when i lost my job in August of this year. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can understand where your coming from with that, especially since this pandemic occurred. EOS 3 0 6 Yes, finances have especially been very tight. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] it seems like this could be overwhelming to you and trying to figure out the right path to go forward. EOS 3 0 8 It is, have you ever encountered such a situation in your life? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I can relate to you in this situation 100% and if it wasnt for me stepping out on faith and opening my own practice, I wouldnt be here now.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello, I am looking for help in managing some depression. EOS 3 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You' ve come to a good place to start. Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 3 I am feeling resentful towards my husband for quitting his job, and my son for being the reason that he quit his job.. My son' s behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us. EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband' s loss of work and your son' s loss of his job is entirely understandable. EOS 3 0 5 I have a hard time not dwelling on the negative things going on. It' s hard to see anything positive or feel hopeful for the future. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and I understand the added stress that can cause in your household. That is a really difficult position to be in. EOS 3 0 7 My son is very defiant and argues with us about everything we try and get him to do, but he expects us to give him money for fun things that he wants to do when he isn' t willing to work or even help out around the house. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Regardless of what your husband' s actions are and your son' s, could you possibly make the time to do things to support yourself, that even momentarily would provide you with some positive feelings? EOS 3 0 9 I try to go for a run every night, that does help.. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard emotionally, so I am sorry you have to deal with your son' s behavior. EOS 3 0 11 It is hard to keep my emotions separate from what is going on with him. EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is very understandable! Setting boundaries for yourself may help. Even when it' s difficult, being clear with your son that you will not be giving him money could help. Sometimes being clear with your own expectations can help him to see what won' t be accepted from him as long as he is living in your home. EOS 3 0 13 Yes, I could do better at that. I want him to have fun and do things with friends, but I want him to be willing to work for what he wants, too.. I do struggle with expectations. I want him to be someone that he is not willing to be, I need to let go of that and just let him be himself and not base my emotions on his choices. EOS 3 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand that. Especially when it comes to people we are close to, it can be hard to separate our expectations from theirs.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 0 0 1 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am doing great, how about you? EOS 0 0 3 I am doing good. Can I talk to you about something? EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course you can, tell me about it:) EOS 0 0 5 I am worried that I won' t be able to complete my degree. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Why so?
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic? EOS 0 0 16 so literally, I only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. I only started a new work in September, and it' s not much( about two days a week), so I can' t comment too much about that. It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps. EOS 0 0 18 so I get nervous in general when I am at work but I do my work just the same. May not be able to work as well because I have to breathe through a mask, and some other small difficulties. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is good that you can continue to do your work the same. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you for all the positive messages so far and in understanding and sympathizing with me.. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] Is there anything else I should know about how the pandemic is affecting you? EOS 0 0 22 pretty much. If anything, it' s my academic life at home that has changed not so well.. EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Are you a student? EOS 0 0 24 yes, I take online courses and I tend to procrastinate a lot more and get distracted as I find myself more and more at home. Just getting carried away and now have impending deadlines.. I can get through it but it has had a toll on my productivity.. I was just taking my sweet time with it and that wasn' t good. EOS 0 1 25 [Self-disclosure] I am also a student and am not motivated to do school work at home, so I completely understand. I am sure you are successful at school! Having a planner may keep you organized and on - task. Dedicating a certain time frame and area for school work might help, as well.. EOS 0 0 26 Because prior to the pandemic, I was pretty regimented with set schedules and can clear my mind with work - outs and going to the gym and movies, but now it' s not that simple.. EOS 0 1 27 [Question] Is there anything else I can help you with? EOS 0 0 28 Thank you and I hope your schooling goes well also.. EOS 0 1 29 [Greeting] Thank you, you too!
0 0 0 Hi how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I' m doing fine, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 Doing ok, thanks. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] thats good what do you have planned for the holidays? EOS 0 0 4 Not a whole lot due to the economic hardship my family and I are facing. How about you?. as far as holiday plans. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I completely understand that i feel that pain as well. are you there? EOS 0 0 6 oh I am sorry to hear that. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s ok there are plenty of other things that you can do with family during this time. EOS 0 0 8 Thats true that should be the holiday spirit and keep hope alive. EOS 0 1 9 [Question] exactly so what else do you have planned are you ready for the new year? EOS 0 0 10 Cook a good meal and spend time with my kids and spouse. Gifts wont be extravagant this year but I guess its the thought that counts. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes it' s the thought that counts and being blessed to be around love ones. EOS 0 0 12 Totally, thanks for that insight. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I myself is going to enjoy good food and enjoy hopefully some decent winter weather. your welcome.
2 0 0 Good evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hi, how' s things? EOS 2 0 2 Things are ok I am just having issues with the problem above. EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I am afraid that I am not able to see that.. can you tell me about it? EOS 2 0 4 Yes, so I have always done very well in school and university. I have always had A' s or high B' s. Last semester in university, I failed one of my exams. I still passed the class with an A, but for some reason, that exam haunts me and gives me bad dreams. I don' t know why it happens and it worries me. EOS 2 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - when I was sitting my final exams I constantly had nightmares about failing. Nearly thirty years on and I still do!! But - you did really very well and you passed with an A. Do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself?
6 0 0 Hello, how are you?. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 6 0 2 I' m alright, honestly I' m feeling rather ashamed. The reason for that and the problem that I' m facing is that I' ve had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and I' m only 24 years old. Right now in my life I' m ready to seek help, but I' m having a lot of anxiety about it because I' m very worried about how others will judge me. I' m worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that I will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. I' m ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that I' ve made that have gotten me here and I guess my problem is that I just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that I can just finally make the step that I need so desperately and get help. EOS 6 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am in a good position to help you as I am in the same situation. Please know you are not alone. I would definitely recommend seeking help sooner rather than later! Hello? Are you wanting to talk? EOS 6 0 4 Yes of course I didn' t hear it go off, my apologies. I really appreciate that, it really is helpful knowing that I' m not the only one who feels this way. I really know that that' s what I need to do, and I am trying my best to get over my fears and just do it ya know. EOS 6 1 5 [Question] What level of alcohol consumption do you have? EOS 6 0 6 no matter how hard it seems, maybe it wont be when I actual do it. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Trust me everyone will be very sympathetic:). Everyone there will be in the same place. And the longer you keep drinking the more damage you are doing to yourself.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am very sorry to hear that. What are you sad about? EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently? EOS 4 0 5 It is over permanently... EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah I guess, the relationship was a little toxic and she sometimes only used me for money. Maybe is it for the best now that I think about it. EOS 4 1 8 [Others] Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!! EOS 4 0 9 Yeah I just miss having someone there for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] All you need now is to give yourself some TLC.. treat yourself to something nice and go easy on yourself. EOS 4 0 11 What is TLC. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] There will be someone else. I never thought I' d find anyone else but I did and we' ve been together ten years ago now! Tender Loving Care:) Means be good to yourself. EOS 4 0 13 Ok yeah your story is very inspirational to me. Maybe this was needed in order to find the right person. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anything you can do to distract yourself right now? Plan a holiday or take a night class or something? EOS 4 0 15 I am now doing mturk to get my mind off of it to make some extra money. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Save up what you make and buy yourself something nice? EOS 4 0 17 yeah the only problem is I am barely getting any money from this. Do you have any tips onto how I can make more money/ EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There is some very lucrative stuff out there:). Take what we are doing right now for instance. EOS 4 0 19 I mean 15 minutes for 2$ doesn' t seem very lucrative. but I guess it ads up. EOS 4 1 20 [Question] beats flipping burgers;). So, what are you going to do to get yourself back onto the dating market? EOS 4 0 21 I am going to wait for this whole covid thing to end and then get a real job and once I fix my financial situation I will start dating again. EOS 4 1 22 [Others] Ah yes, the world feels like it' s on hold at the moment doesn' t it? Probably not a good time to start sharing germs with new people: D. EOS 4 0 23 Yeah exactly and I have more pressing matters at hand than a girlfriend because like I said, I am in need of money right now since. EOS 4 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' ll be around for ages if you want to talk some more on here! EOS 4 0 25 I think talking to you has benefited me a lot so thank you for that.

EOS 4 1 28 [Providing Suggestions or Information] just wait till fifteen mins is up;). If we quit before then we get less. So, um, tell me about your ex? EOS 4 0 29 ok got it. I met my ex through tinder. and then we started going on dates and we both seemed to like each other. EOS 4 1 30 [Self-disclosure] ah! I met mine through OKCUPID. Online dating is definitely the way to go these days.
4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out. EOS 4 0 6 I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night? EOS 4 0 8 I can' t sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it' s typically late afternoon. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds like you are doing the very best you can under difficult circumstances. you should feel very proud about that. EOS 4 0 10 thank you. i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] it sounds to me that your sleep issue is really weighing on your mind. you may be setting yourself up for sleep issues by thinking about this so much. is that possible?
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one. EOS 4 0 16 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. What else can I do besides meditation? EOS 4 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds? EOS 4 0 18 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. Candles are much better for me. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil. EOS 4 0 20 I haven' t heard of that website before. I' ll have to check it out. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships. EOS 4 0 22 Well, I haven' t been in a long - term relationship like this before.. My past relationships were all in high school, and they only lasted a few weeks or months at a time. I really cared for this one, and we were together for so long. EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] I feel obligated to help during Christmas because I had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts. EOS 4 0 24 You had a fight with your partner? I' m sorry, it' s the worst when people fight over what' s supposed to be something nice. EOS 4 1 25 [Question] What was the fight over? Food? Money? Sex? EOS 4 0 26 I forget what started it, it was something stupid. He didn' t like the way I said something and it kind of blew up from there. We were fighting over the smallest things these last few months. It just kind of built up to the point where he said he couldn' t take fighting with me anymore and just wanted to end it. EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would let things decompress for a long while. EOS 4 0 28 End the relationship, I mean. You think maybe if we just take some time apart, he might want to talk about it? EOS 4 1 29 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest thinking through ending the relationship if he has a hot temper.. EOS 4 0 30 He does get upset very easily. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, just think it through for some time.. EOS 4 0 32 I do think it is important to take some time and breathe. EOS 4 1 33 [Question] Was the relationship with him pleasant for many months? EOS 4 0 34 Yes, for most of our time together it was wonderful. He made me laugh very easily. That' s part of why I' m so sad that he ended the relationship. EOS 4 1 35 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said it has only gotten rough in the last two months? EOS 4 0 36 Two or three, yes. And we would fight over the smallest things, it was really stupid. EOS 4 1 37 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that he has announced to you he has ended the relationship on Christmas? Today, you mean? EOS 4 0 38 Yes, and it was our one year anniversary. We were supposed to order takeout and watch a movie and exchange presents. Instead we fought and broke up. EOS 4 1 39 [Reflection of feelings] In my opinion, I would consider accepting that it is not going to be a healthy relationship whatsoever.

EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression? EOS 3 0 6 Covid - 19. and money issues. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, this has really been a hard time for all of us. How has it impacted you personally? EOS 3 0 8 my mom and sister had caught the virus they are doing ok now but it was rough. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how hard that must have been. I' m glad they are doing ok now though!
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 6 0 1 hi. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing? EOS 6 0 3 Well I' m distraught. EOS 6 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel that way? EOS 6 0 5 Because my girlfriend has left me. EOS 6 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard for you. I haven' t personally had to deal with that, but I have had friends that have. How long were you together? EOS 6 0 7 four years. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being together that long must have made that break up difficult. How are you coping with it? EOS 6 0 9 well I' m not really, especially as she' d gone off with someone else. But I' m to blame which makes it worse. EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened? EOS 6 0 11 I cheated on her on a drunken night. It was a one - off and I regret it terribly. But she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain. EOS 6 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I see how she would be upset. It must be difficult for you though because she didn' t give you another chance. Do you have someone to talk to about your feelings? EOS 6 0 13 yeah, I' m not saying I deserved it just wish she had. But no, not really. No - one who would understand. EOS 6 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I would have wanted a second chance too if I were in your shoes. Is this affecting you really bad? EOS 6 0 15 Yeah I feel so low. EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If your mood is affecting your daily activities, normally that means your mental health has been affected. You could always talk to a professional if it' s hard for you.
4 0 0 I' m feeling really sad, I thought it was going somewhere. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What do you mean you thought it was going somewhere? Are you okay?

EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there. EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck. EOS 0 0 7 How did you push past that job? EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work. EOS 0 0 9 Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career? EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too. EOS 0 0 11 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Can you give me some more details? EOS 0 0 13 I just find the work mundane and way too remedial. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable.

Are you in a trade school? Or in academia? EOS 2 0 5 In college. I started off really well until the pandemic hit. Now my family is struggling financially and it has greatly affected my academics. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Well, I went through a similar situation when a pink - eye breakout hurt my school.... I struggled financially, but took any job I could..... EOS 2 0 7 What kind of jobs did you take? EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Work part - time and go to school part - time. EOS 2 0 9 I' m trying to find a steady job. jobs that can help support both my family and my tuition. EOS 2 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest creating flyers and ask to be a dog walker. Americans love their dogs. 70 Percent of Americans have dogs. EOS 2 0 11 oh okay that' s interesting. there' s a part time job at a local library should I take it? EOS 2 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I feel that you can be great and be a good entrepreneur..... dog walking doesn' t take a lot of talent. EOS 2 0 13 thank you for that. EOS 2 1 14 [Question] How close in the library? EOS 2 0 15 the library is within the campus. EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Ok, that is good. I once worked at a library. EOS 2 0 17 you did? how was the experience? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I worked in a library many years.....

EOS 4 0 3 I am really sad and stressed up knowing that I am soon losing my job due to the effects of corona virus. For sure if I lose my job now I might go to depression because I have a family to take care of. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, don' t worry friend, EOS 4 0 5 Are there any ways you know that could help me convince my boss that that it is not the right time to cut down on manpower? EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] lot of people lose the job in this corona time. just explain you situation. EOS 4 0 7 Incase i lose the job, are there ways that can help me stay out of stress of losing the job? I am worried that losing a job may cause me a lot of harm since my bills depend on my current job. EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] definitely, you have to try to get the other work. don' t give up your confident, belive your self. EOS 4 0 9 I am really worried that getting another job during this season of corona is not easy, that is the stress that is almost killing me. Sure I do believe myself. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] you know any other self work? EOS 4 0 11 Not really. Do you happen to know any that can sustain me? EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i am not sure. what' s your occupation?
0 1 0 [Question] hello how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hello I am taking a break from my studies to talk. I am fine thanks. Hope you are doing well also. I am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines. EOS 0 1 2 [Self-disclosure] i am fine thanks for asking. EOS 0 0 3 two exams and two assignments due at the end of this and next month. that' s good. EOS 0 1 4 [Others] Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful. EOS 0 0 5 yeah I have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it' s online and basically I do things on my own time.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you taking a lot of courses? EOS 0 0 7 2 courses. but I am pretty much using full time capacity on them. devoting full - time I mean. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] do you like doing school online better than in person? EOS 0 0 9 Have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good the more time you have to devote the better! EOS 0 0 11 I have done both methods. I definitely prefer in - school studies.. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel it is more stressful online? EOS 0 0 13 I am just disappointed that I have been slacking off and procrastinating. no it' s just that it' s a different avenue. I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. I think it' s because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow.. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after. EOS 0 0 15 yeah I take breaks in between.. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Yea this pandemic has me not as motivated to. EOS 0 0 17 But sometimes a lot more breaks or longer breaks than intended or I should. yeah definitely. Sorry to hear that.. It' s like everyday is the same and I can' t go out to refresh my mind or have a change of pace such as going to the gym or go out for a run. whereas before the pandemic, I can switch gears that way and come back refreshed. like going out to the movies and coming back with renewed enthusiasm. EOS 0 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Yea i have been missing the gym myself. Now i lookup youtube videos of workouts and do them, and it really helps to get me going in the day. Do you ever listen to music while you are trying to get work done? When i do that it tends to help time go faster and i get more done.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 I' m good. How about you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Very little to complain about today. What brings you here? EOS 3 0 3 Just want to talk some random stuff basically just want a companion. EOS 3 1 4 [Others] How' s the weather where you are? EOS 3 0 5 Still pretty cold and dry in here, how about there? EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Exactly the same. What are you doing to stay warm? EOS 3 0 7 Just in my long pajamas with heater. I don' t really know what to do anymore, I am just lazy on everything. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well you' re resourceful at staying warm, at least. You mentioned wanting a companion, are you living alone? EOS 3 0 9 not really I' m living with my family but I don' t really talk to them anymore I' m just in my room all day. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Is it the stress of the pandemic getting to you& your family, or something else? EOS 3 0 11 It' s something else. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Can you share? EOS 3 0 13 Just a fight from years ago and I decided to not talk to them anymore.. EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] That' s completely your decision, but it can bring us down at times. What are you doing to stay positive during these crazy times in the world? I know you mentioned feeling lazy. Sometimes I make a list of things in the morning that I want to accomplish. Even if I get one done, it' s a win.: -) EOS 3 0 15 I talk to my friends online, play games, watch movies, etc. I know, I should find a productive hobby. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] A hobby could be another outlet for you in addition to talking to your friends online. You don' t have to put too much pressure on yourself for it to be productive. What hobby ideas do you have?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability. EOS 3 0 21 i applied for disability but didn' t get it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself. EOS 3 0 23 yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn' t matter. EOS 3 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Social Security stopped you. Why? EOS 3 0 25 i' m not injured enough for them. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can file against the company if you can prove neglect in the employer.. Were there proper safety guards. EOS 3 0 27 I tried but since it is the state of PA they have immunity. no. EOS 3 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was a state injury, there must be an avenue you can use to prove neglect. EOS 3 0 29 I was told that I assumed the risk of injury working for them. It was a mental hospital. EOS 3 1 30 [Question] have you contacted OSHA and filed a complaint with them? EOS 3 0 31 not yet. I should. EOS 3 1 32 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There should be an avenue for you to seek compensation. EOS 3 0 33 The lawyer fought with them for over a year. There was even an appeal but I lost that too. EOS 3 1 34 [Reflection of feelings] It is unfortunate that safety is not a factor. It was a state hospital? EOS 3 0 35 yes. EOS 3 1 36 [Question] Did a patient attack you?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 The season has me down. No family around. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Are you finding time to do things you enjoy by yourself? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 3 trying to work and write but lack motivation. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are feeling some lethargy in this cold season, and feel as though you have no support from your family. EOS 0 0 5 I don' t talk to anyone. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any plans to spend Christmas with family or friends? That may help to break the cycle of feeling low? EOS 0 0 7 I live in a hotel currently. No family or friends around, especially with the virus. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What do you do for work? Are you able to get out of the hotel frequently? EOS 0 0 9 I am a writer. Witht he virus it is hard to meet anyone. i am only here until next week then I have to go to Virignia. My children r all over the country. EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I agree, it is hard to spend time with people at the moment. We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted. It would be good to have something positive to look forward to. EOS 0 0 11 I try the dating sites, but they seem to far away or impersonal. Hope things are better. Just the current season ahs me down. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I can see that. Keep in touch with your family and try to think of positive, happy times you can all have together in the future. EOS 0 0 13 No verbal communication makes it hard. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Can you call them?
4 0 0 I just lost my job and am worried about paying the bills. EOS 4 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills. EOS 4 0 2 There is just too much pressure, but I have to succeed. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is hard having so much pressure but I think you will be able to soon get employed again. EOS 4 0 4 I am trying. I' ve started looking online for new positions but it is a process. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise. EOS 4 0 6 I just still am continually nervous and having a hard time coping. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes deep breaths help people calm down. Have you tried that at all? EOS 4 0 8 I haven' t but maybe that will help me stay calmer. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That can sometimes help you to regain your focus and be able to do more for yourself. EOS 4 0 10 That makes sense. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Also, job counselors may help at employment agencies to match you with potential employers. Have you tried any? EOS 4 0 12 I haven' t but that may be helpful as well. EOS 4 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I sought out help from a recruiter online who helped me to find a job as well. Have you heard of that option or tried it?
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him.
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Somewhat stressed but otherwise ok. How about you? EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I am great, it snowed and looks like Christmas here. Why are you so stressed? EOS 0 0 4 I' m developing romantic feelings for a friend but she doesn' t share those feelings with me in return. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. I have been there myself.. Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend? EOS 0 0 6 Yes, I had received that advice from someone and tried it but it didn' t help. We have been friends for a long time and I think it would be tough to smother these romantic feelings. EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Have you thought about talking with this friend about these feelings? EOS 0 0 8 I have but I' m sure she wouldn' t react very well and it could damage our relationship.. I' m also pretty sure she' s already aware. She' s pretty sharp. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well maybe you should address these feelings with her in a very relaxed public atmosphere. Just let her know that you really like her and you have realized that she has many of the qualities that you look for in a person to get serious with. However, you treasure your friendship more than anything and you do not want anything to come in between your friendship.... this way you have addressed your feelings, she knows how you feel and then should she decide to every take the friendship to the next step, she wouldn' t feel awkward. EOS 0 0 10 That sounds like a good plan. I do like having things out in the open instead of holding them in. My other thought was to maybe try to seek out a romantic partner that isn' t her so then maybe the feelings would go to another focus and it wouldn' t damage our relatinship. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a great idea. Have you been dating other people much? EOS 0 0 12 No, it has been difficult with the whole Corona virus thing. I have taken a large income hit and also I' m having trouble finding someone who wants to actually go do something. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes the Corona virus has really put a damper on all kinds of normal activities. Have you thought about joining like a group with similar interests as yourself? Maybe look for a local group that has a Facebook page and you can start with building friendships just by chatting online or even on the public page itself. Some of the best lasting relationships start out as friends with similar interests and then they blossom.
1 0 0 im very upset. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry. Would you like to tell me about it? EOS 1 0 2 yes. i invited my friend over to watch my new puppy while i painted my room because my dog has seperation anxiety and can' t be alone. then she showed up with her new boyfriend. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] What bothered you about that? EOS 1 0 4 well i dont know him and my stuff was all out in the living room where he was alone for most of the day. i actually didnt suspect anything would happen at first. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can see why that would upset you though. Did something happen? EOS 1 0 6 yes, after they left, i started putting my stuff back in my room and realized the purse i keep my nintendo switch in was GONE. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m so sorry that happened to you. I would be very upset as well. EOS 1 0 8 i' ve known her for 8 years. but this guy is very new. they' re not even officially together. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Did you speak to your friend about it?
1 0 0 im very upset. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry. Would you like to tell me about it? EOS 1 0 2 yes. i invited my friend over to watch my new puppy while i painted my room because my dog has seperation anxiety and can' t be alone. then she showed up with her new boyfriend. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] What bothered you about that? EOS 1 0 4 well i dont know him and my stuff was all out in the living room where he was alone for most of the day. i actually didnt suspect anything would happen at first. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can see why that would upset you though. Did something happen? EOS 1 0 6 yes, after they left, i started putting my stuff back in my room and realized the purse i keep my nintendo switch in was GONE. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m so sorry that happened to you. I would be very upset as well. EOS 1 0 8 i' ve known her for 8 years. but this guy is very new. they' re not even officially together. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Did you speak to your friend about it? EOS 1 0 10 yes, so i called her and asked her if she saw my bag and she got defensive. she started talking about how much money he has and how he doesnt have to steal. EOS 1 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It is sometimes hard for people to believe someone they care about could do something bad. EOS 1 0 12 but she should care about me more!! she barely knows him. EOS 1 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have been in a similar situation with a friend and her husband; when he was exhibiiing bad behavior, she did not want to see it in him. I agree that she should value you your friendship more than someone she just met. EOS 1 0 14 last time we went out for brunch, he literally tried to make her pay for it! that' s not the behavior of someone that has money like she claims. she' s delusional. EOS 1 1 15 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are worried about your friend putting her trust into this guy. EOS 1 0 16 im worried about how i' m going to get my switch back. i dont have money for a new one. im thinking of calling the cops. EOS 1 1 17 [Others] I think if you talk to her again and tell her you are looking out for her best interests it may help open a conversation. If you do end up calling the cops, at least you will have tried to speak with her first.
3 0 0 Hello, I need some help with this. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I' m here to help you. EOS 3 0 2 What should I do about my break up? EOS 3 1 3 [Question] When it was happened. EOS 3 0 4 It happened yesterday. She broke up with me. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh.. It' s really sad. But don' t worry. You can explain feelings to her. She may change her mind. EOS 3 0 6 I will try but I don' t think she will want to listen. I do not think she likes me anymore. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I understand your feelings. If it is a true love, she will also understand your feelings. EOS 3 0 8 I think I will call her later, I will try to follow your advice. What should I do to help my bad emotions? EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] To escape from negative thoughts keep engaging yourself in your favorite work. Listen to your favorite music. EOS 3 0 10 I feel bad about the whole covid thing. I think there is a lot of stress about it with my ex girlfriend so she feels stressed about that. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Hello Are you there?
4 1 0 [Question] hi how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Not good, i am very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i' m sorry. whats making you sad? EOS 4 0 3 My friend just stopped talking to me and she won' t tell me the reason why. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] has she communicated via text or messanger? or has all communication stopped? EOS 4 0 5 She stopped communicating completely. Doesn' t even reply to me texts. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] i' m so sorry to hear that. i had a friend do that to me right after the spring pandemic lockdown. did this happen recently? EOS 4 0 7 Yes, just this past week. How did you deal with your situation? EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] i was upset, but then after thinking about it more, i figured she just was overwhelmed with everything going on. i gave her the benefit of the doubt and texted happy birthday this summer and didn' t hear anything back. can you think of anything going on with her that might cause her to stop communicating? EOS 4 0 9 That' s too bad. I suppose that one should be able to let the other person know when you no; longer want to be friends with them. That way one can move on quickly. I am completely unaware. We haven' t had any argument of late so i am completely clueless. Wish she would just reach out. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] i can imagine it' s hard to put those feeling into words when you want to move on. EOS 4 0 11 Exactly. Do you know of any online resources that one can use to get through such situations? EOS 4 1 12 [Question] but, it' s left you feeling sad. how are things going otherwise? EOS 4 0 13 The other areas of my life are doing good. Just that the sadness is getting to me at times. EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i don' t know of any specific resources. i' m sorry. however, its good that things are going well otherwise. how are relationships with others in your life going? i have found that I focusd on other friendships more since my friend ghosted me.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Nice to meet you Jim, I am doing well. Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 3 I really appreciate your time Yes. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What is on your mind? EOS 0 0 5 I have been retired for over 2 years and would like to return to the workforce, part - ti me. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are thinking of going back to work? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, It would help us greatly. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have the right idea already. EOS 0 0 9 There are plenty of jobs and not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will find something suitable if you keep trying. EOS 0 0 11 Thanks What do you mean? Yeah, I know this but I don' t feel it.. EOS 0 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] You may feel a little apprehensive to get started.
1 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 1 0 1 I am just a little angry. My mother and I had another blow - up. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother? EOS 1 0 3 It is why I am angry. This occurs at least every other day. I say something harmless and she thinks I am saying it in a way that is rude or something. EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you can figure out a way to communicate better. EOS 1 0 5 I do not know for sure where to start. If I try to tell her that is not what I mean it is like she doesn' t understand? EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to feel misunderstood.
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend.
4 1 0 [Question] HI there, How are you doing today? EOS 4 0 1 Its hard for me to find a job. things could be doing better. it' s been a bad week for me. EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] I understand that, it is hard to find a job. I got terminated during the beginning of covid. EOS 4 0 3 Yea, i got laid off in July. the market has been tough. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I actually took a job at walmart just to make ends meet. Not the best situation but hey, my family can eat. EOS 4 0 5 thats good. i' m an engineer and i would like to take another engineering role. but they are hard to come by now adays. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea, would you consider doing something lesser for now just to make sure you have some income coming in? Or do you still collect unemployment at least? EOS 4 0 7 yes, i still get some unemployment which helps. i' ve done many interviews. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Thats good at least. Well, its great you are being proactive about it! I hate saying this but, just hang in there and keep moving on. EOS 4 0 9 yes. so i' m hoping to find something soon before the holidays. yes thank you. i just want to be able to buy presents for my family. and make it to 2021. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] I hear ya, im doing everything i can to make a bit of extra money just so my kid can have a semi normal christmas! EOS 4 0 11 yes exactly, i have two young ones. its already hard for them to be at home all day and zoom for school. i just want to make this christmas specia. so its been a bummer with covid going on. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea i feel so bad for her. Thing is so presents arent everythign. Since you got little ones might be time for some new traditions. Make some" igloo" forts and have an indoor snowball fight with balled of socks or something like that. EOS 4 0 13 thanks. well i' m going to have to continue looking for jobs on linkedin. thank you for your time. EOS 4 1 14 [Greeting] Thanks for sharing! EOS 4 0 15 any other advice to offer me. before i go. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hmm lets see, more a fun thing to do then advice, my daughter saw some xmas dessert she wants to make. Its pretty simple. Get some candy canes and poke em into marshmellows. Melt some chocolate and dip the marshmellows into them. Cover with sprinkles and let harden. Might be a fun thing to do. Id focus on experience over material this holiday. EOS 4 0 17 awesome. those are some great ideas. and not cost a lot of money. EOS 4 1 18 [Greeting] Yea, i hope things work out for you! EOS 4 0 19 thanks. have a good day. good sunday. EOS 4 1 20 [Others] You as well!
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late?
2 1 0 [Question] hi! how are you doing today> EOS 2 0 1 Hello, I' m doing okay, wbu? EOS 2 1 2 [Others] ok it' s been a stressful time for most of us but we are all doing the best we can.
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. EOS 3 0 16 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. EOS 3 0 18 That is a good point.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. EOS 3 0 20 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand. EOS 3 0 22 I should trust my partner more than any random person. EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters. EOS 3 0 24 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? EOS 3 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you.... even after work. EOS 3 0 26 okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. EOS 3 0 28 That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all. EOS 0 0 45 Also being far away from him sucks. EOS 0 1 46 [Question] Are you guys FaceTiming or communicating at all other than by texts? EOS 0 0 47 You are being very helpful by the way thank you. We aren' t FaceTiming. I just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it.. EOS 0 1 48 [Greeting] I' m trying my best, thank you for the input! Upset about leaving the apartment? Or was there something else that happened that weekend?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you today? EOS 3 0 1 hi i am okay, a little bit sad though. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Okay. I am very sorry to hear that! Do you want to tell me more about that? EOS 3 0 3 Well with the holidays coming up i have been very stressed and nervous about what i am going to do. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really feel you there. Holidays are so hard.. especially with the way this year has been. Anything specific?. EOS 3 0 5 Yes. I am a college student and I live on campus. The day before I moved in my dad said some unforgivable things to me and we haven' t spoke since. I have no choice but to go live at home over the break but I am very scared about it. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Do you feel scared for your own self? Or of the situation in general? I' m sorry to hear that. Relationships with parents can be very difficult sometimes.. I' m around college age as well and also live at home. So I can understand your struggle. EOS 3 0 7 more for the situation in general. i know we will not speak but we will constantly be running into each other, my house is not big. and i have no car to escape it. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] It' s like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it' s such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you' re not positive in. I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely.. It' ll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets? EOS 3 0 9 Thank you I appreciate that. I will be fine making it over the thanksgiving break but I am more nervous about covid - 19 sending us home for good.. Not many to be honest. I have a hamster but he is at school with me so nothing at home to go back to. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like Covid - 19 is going to be a personal stressor for you. It' s such a strange thing to have to live with already, the pandemic, and i' m sorry that it might end up pushing you where you don' t want to be. Could you bring your hamster home with you? Even the smallest things could help a place feel more loving. EOS 3 0 11 Yes it is very strange and I know that it is a big stressor on all of us, i don' t want to sound selfish.. Yes i am bringing him home with me so that is my little piece of joy that is coming along. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t think you' re selfish at all. You have feelings you are entitled to have and are expressing them which is healthy and I encourage that behavior! Good! I know how hard this situation can be. Very nerve wracking. The smallest things, even a hamster, can be so beneficial. EOS 3 0 13 Well thank you that does help me to feel better. Yes I am happy to bring him home with me and hoping I can have my niece over to intro duce her to him. EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] You sound like a very determined person in making this trip as stress free as possible. I commend you for that! Maybe you could have your niece over often to play with your hamster just to soften the stress of being there. EOS 3 0 15 It is surely my goal! I appreciate your kind words. I would love that if I had a car I could do that but I am not sure how much she will be able to come to my house. I am going to try though! EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is Uber an option for you? I know there' s a lot of rideshare services but they' re not always financially reasonable. But that could be a way to get away if you ever need too! EOS 3 0 17 that is very true i didn' t even think of that to be honest! I may use that along the way, thank you for the reminder! EOS 3 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes I forget little things like that to help myself whenever I get too involved in the emotional aspect of things. I' m glad I could suggest it to you!. EOS 3 0 19 Thank you! Well i appreciate your help a lot and hope you have a great day! EOS 3 1 20 [Greeting] Of course! I hope you do as well and happy holidays!
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? I' d love to chat with you! What' s been on your mind? EOS 3 0 1 oh hello. I' m having problems with friends - or more precisely the lack of them. I don' t have any. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see. You feel as though you don' t have any friend' s currently? I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It' s so hard to see people and keep relationships right now. EOS 3 0 3 Well it' s more that I think I' ve never had friends. Not anyone I can confide in or laugh with. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a really hard thing to be going through. I' m sorry to hear that. Do you have any really close family members that you are able to confide in? EOS 3 0 5 I don' t think I' d want to let them know how unhappy I am to be honest. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Oh I see. Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn' t have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out! IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it' s 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do. I actually found a couple close friends through apps like that. Have you heard about those or looked into them? EOS 3 0 7 I' ve never heard of friendship apps to be honest. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah! They are a really good way to connect with people that you share a lot of similar interests with.. But it sounds to me that you are pretty overall sad right now. You don' t want family to know about how sad you are. Do you think it' s more than just feeling like you don' t have any friends? EOS 3 0 9 I' d really like someone local though, someone who I could meet up with face to face and who knew my town. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] On most of the apps, it connects you with people in your town! people close by. EOS 3 0 11 I don' t know if it' s more than that. What do you mean? The problem is that I lack the courage to go out and meet people. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Well personally, I have struggled with putting myself down a lot and blaming myself for things that I shouldn' t blame myself for. You shouldn' t blame yourself for not having the courage to go meet people, or blame yourself for not having any friends! And if that is what you are struggling with, then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you! You can create those bonds and connections with people close by to you on there first, and then when you feel comfortable enough with them you can meet up. That way it' s less awkward to hangout with someone you don' t really know.
0 0 0 Hello, is anone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Yes sorry, the app was misbehaving. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I don' t know. I' m shaking because I don' t know what I' m going to do. EOS 0 1 3 [Others] Im sorry to hear that, but going to do about what situation specifically? EOS 0 0 4 I know you' re busy prepping for the holiday but I described my problem earlier. It should be listed either at the top or on the left side of your screen. I know you' re probably prepping for the holiday. I didn' t mean to interrupt your Sunday. EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Im sorry but we do not get those promps. We just get to talk pretty much, we have to find out whats going on. You are not interrupting anything. EOS 0 0 6 Here! Last Christmas I bought the condo of my dreams. This April 2020 I lost my job due Covid 19. My unemployment is ending and my savings are depleted. I' ve recived an eviction notice and don' t know what to do. Help! Have you ever been evicted? EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Where are you that you are able to be evicted? You should not be able to be evicted from your home during this time in pretty much every state. Have you tried contacting anyone for help other than your landlord? EOS 0 0 8 I' m still in my condo but I no longer have a job, umemployment has run out and my savings are all gone. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well the plus side is they cannot kick you out right now. Have you talk to your landlord about working out some payment arrangement. Have you tried applying for any job? Now is not the time for pride to get in the way, i would accept anything. EOS 0 0 10 When you say work out a plan what do you mean? I have no job. I have been applying for jobs but I haven' t received a callback or an offer of employment. Have you ever been in this situation? Also, I' m calling a helpline so Pride is not my issue. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different. I am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass. I was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures. They could work out a way you can pay extra monthly when you get back on your feet. EOS 0 0 12 It' s kind of hard to work out a plan when you don' t know where your next meal is coming from don' t you think? Do you know anything about the eviction process and where do people go once they have been evicted. Who is this they that your speaking about? I don' t mean to be crass either but I have never been jobless or homeless either. So I' m desperate here and don' t know what to do? EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Your landlord. I worked out a way with payments when i was furloughed from my job. And yes i was actually homeless many years ago so i do know what it feels like to miss out on meals for a days at a time. It seems you should look up evictions during Covid. They are not allowed to throw you on the street as long as the pandemic is going on. EOS 0 0 14 How did you eat and where did you sleep when you were homeless? How long did it take to end your situation? If you were homeless what did you say to your landlord that they still put you out? Where did you wash up or brush your teeth? EOS 0 1 15 [Question] Oh for my situation it was 100% my fault i was in a bad place during that time. I spent my time couch surfing til my friends got tired of me. Bounced around shelters after i sold my car. Washing up and brushing my teeth were the least of my problems. May i ask what state you are in? EOS 0 0 16 I rather not say. But thank you for you for sharing and i hope you and your family have a good Thanksgiving. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I was going to paste a link for you on evictions during covid. Please just google Evictions during covid( your state) you will find groups that can help and the laws, that are on your side. I hope you can overcome this, i know you will.
3 0 0 Hi. I am Mike. Live in central Kansas and have been very depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that, is there a particular reason or instance for you feeling this way? EOS 3 0 2 I lost my job due to Covid and they have shut down for good. no jobs around here and no vehicle so i feel hopeless and hate my living situation. just before covid hit i was saving to move... but then job closed. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes that is a very tough situation, Covid has real placed a large amount of stress through out the world. There may be a ray of hope however with a possible vaccine in the near future, maybe this will be back to normal soon and new jobs will become available. EOS 3 0 4 I hope so and that is what i know mentally. but emotionally it is hard. i just hate having no job, being at home, no money, no vehicle, and a very bad idea to date since there is a high contagious pandemic. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand and you are right it is a a lot of mental stress. Have you reached out to claim unemployment or go to a food pantry? During this pandemic you should not feel shameful to take advantage of these services, there are alot of people who have to ask for help for the first time in their lives. EOS 3 0 6 I did not make enough to get unemployment they said. I have not tried a food pantry but that is a great idea. what makes this difficult is I am in a very small town. like we dont wal marts or McDonalds or anything like that. Whole town closes at 9. the closest actual city is 45 miles away. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well please try the food pantry and see what they have to offer. Is there anyone whom you could ask for a ride in the future when they go to the bigger city? EOS 3 0 8 I will try food pantry. my sister goes to the city once a month, we shop for the month and i stay with my siter. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well its seem that you now have a plan try it out see how it works, hopefully this will get back to normal sooner than later and life may go back to somewhat normal and your stress level and mental exhaustion will also subside. Is there anything else you would like to talk about? EOS 3 0 10 Well I have been wanting a relationship. and i normally dont feel that way at all. and past week i think how much i kind of should have a family as I am 37 but not sure if i truly want that or i just miss human contact as i have only been around family and not gone out at all except to walk and go to store in town, and am confused if it is actully me wanting somone in my life or just a physical thing. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think your exactly right, human contact is now a premium and I' m sure you miss that contact that we were once so use to. Missing the contact makes you realize how much you enjoy the company of others. Take it slow and once the vaccine is out ease your way back into the dating scene and see if a relationship is what you really wanted after all.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 Am ok but feeling sad and anxious. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that you are sad and anxious. Do you know what is causing you to feel that way? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I recently lost my childhood best friend to covid 19. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can only imagine how sad you feel from losing your best friend. Hopefully chatting some will help. I know in the past when I lost someone it was nice to just have a conversation to help put my mind at ease. EOS 0 0 5 Sure. I feel so lonely sometimes because we were very close. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that you are feeling lonely. Did you have any mutual friends with your best friend that you can reach out to? I am sure they are feeling the same way and it could help both of you to talk to each other and share stories. EOS 0 0 7 Yes we have mutual friends. I do reach out to them sometimes. But the feeling doesn' t go away. It makes me have sleepless nights. I can' t sleep. Every time I close my eyes I see him very close to me like we are having conversations. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you were really close to your best friend. It can take time to get through the grief of losing someone. Things will get better I promise.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 I am fine thank you. How are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am very well. Do you have any problems you' d like to discuss with me?
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state. EOS 0 0 6 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well. EOS 0 0 8 Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing( which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all. I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out. EOS 0 0 10 What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job: it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. Working there would be ministry, not typical work. And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, that' s a big deal. i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Much better than normal, even though the stock market is down. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Are you an investor? EOS 0 0 3 I am a student that tries to put as much money into as possible. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand the struggle with being at that stage in life. Has this affected you negatively?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi my name is Sarah, how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hi, Sarah. I am at my wits end. I feel like I am going crazy. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That sounds stressful. What' s happening? EOS 0 0 3 I am stressed out about having to move and I just can' t seem to calm down when it is time to sleep.. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Moving is such a stressful time. When do you move?. EOS 0 0 5 I am moving in a month, but there is just so much to do before then. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. What is your wind - down routine like in the evening, if you have one? EOS 0 0 7 I usually put my kids to bed and then try to relax for about an hour while I watch tv before I head to bed. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Oh you' re a parent AND you are moving, you have a lot on your plate! EOS 0 0 9 Yes, I am a homeschooling mother of two.. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried a warm bath before bed? that' s helped me before. Meditation to still my mind before sleeping helps too. I' ve read that a small carb snack before bed, like a peice of toast, is supposed to help us fall asleep, I haven' t tried it though. EOS 0 0 11 A bath does sound really relaxing. I have tried some meditations. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One thing I highly recommend is a podcast called" Tracks to Relax".
4 1 0 [Question] hi how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Not good, i am very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i' m sorry. whats making you sad? EOS 4 0 3 My friend just stopped talking to me and she won' t tell me the reason why. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] has she communicated via text or messanger? or has all communication stopped? EOS 4 0 5 She stopped communicating completely. Doesn' t even reply to me texts. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] i' m so sorry to hear that. i had a friend do that to me right after the spring pandemic lockdown. did this happen recently? EOS 4 0 7 Yes, just this past week. How did you deal with your situation? EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] i was upset, but then after thinking about it more, i figured she just was overwhelmed with everything going on. i gave her the benefit of the doubt and texted happy birthday this summer and didn' t hear anything back. can you think of anything going on with her that might cause her to stop communicating? EOS 4 0 9 That' s too bad. I suppose that one should be able to let the other person know when you no; longer want to be friends with them. That way one can move on quickly. I am completely unaware. We haven' t had any argument of late so i am completely clueless. Wish she would just reach out. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] i can imagine it' s hard to put those feeling into words when you want to move on. EOS 4 0 11 Exactly. Do you know of any online resources that one can use to get through such situations? EOS 4 1 12 [Question] but, it' s left you feeling sad. how are things going otherwise? EOS 4 0 13 The other areas of my life are doing good. Just that the sadness is getting to me at times. EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i don' t know of any specific resources. i' m sorry. however, its good that things are going well otherwise. how are relationships with others in your life going? i have found that I focusd on other friendships more since my friend ghosted me. EOS 4 0 15 The other relationships are good even though i' m now more wary of people because i don' t know who could leave my life at any moment without notice. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s understandable but just because one person has left doesn' t mean that others will.
4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 i feel depresed. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Why do you feel depressed? EOS 4 0 3 breakup with my partner. EOS 4 1 4 [Others] Breakups can be really tough. How long were you with your partner? EOS 4 0 5 3years of time we have been in love. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I once had a relationship end after 5 years with a partner. Staying active really helped me get over the relationship. Through that activity I actually met my new partner! EOS 4 0 7 but i love my partner so much that i couldnt forget her right now. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about doing something fun, like taking a trip somewhere? EOS 4 0 9 yeah we went for trip we had a god relationship. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really difficult, but I know you can get through this! What do you like to do for fun? EOS 4 0 11 we had enjoyment and romance. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about fun activities you did without your partner? EOS 4 0 13 none i love her so much so i have not done anything without her. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] What about before you met her?
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am very sorry to hear that. What are you sad about? EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently? EOS 4 0 5 It is over permanently... EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah I guess, the relationship was a little toxic and she sometimes only used me for money. Maybe is it for the best now that I think about it. EOS 4 1 8 [Others] Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!! EOS 4 0 9 Yeah I just miss having someone there for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] All you need now is to give yourself some TLC.. treat yourself to something nice and go easy on yourself. EOS 4 0 11 What is TLC. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] There will be someone else. I never thought I' d find anyone else but I did and we' ve been together ten years ago now! Tender Loving Care:) Means be good to yourself.

But still, you never know who to trust anymore. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] trust is tricky. do you know brene brown? the researcher, author, TED talk researcher? EOS 4 0 19 No i don' t. Please tell me about him. EOS 4 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] She researches shame and vunerablilty. I find her very inspriring. EOS 4 0 21 Will check her out immediately. Infact, let me do that now. EOS 4 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] there' s a great video on youtube where she talks about empathy. little cartoon animals.
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you? EOS 1 0 2 Not so good. How are you doing? EOS 1 1 3 [Question] I am doing okay thank you for asking! would you like to talk about whats wrong? EOS 1 0 4 Yes. Well today I had a delivery order. So I went to McDonald' s and pick up the order and took it to the right address and after a few hours I notice that the client did not confirm the order. EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am not knowledgeable in this service industry. Let me understand. You delivered the order, but the customer did not confirm they wanted it.. EOS 1 0 6 Five minutes later my supervisor called me saying that the client call and reported that he did not received his order. And that' s not true at all, I gave him the food. So now i don' t know if they going to fired me or let me keep the job. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation? EOS 1 0 8 Of course I did. He told me he going to give me the benefit of the doubt but that is not enough. Im an honest person and this kind of accusation makes me feel very bad. EOS 1 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I understand, but do not feel bad about yourself. You did your work honestly and delivered the food to your customer. Can I suggest something moving forward?. EOS 1 0 10 Yes. But stuff like that makes me look bad and makes people dont trust me. Sure. That can help. I would appreciate it. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe every time you make a delivery, you can take a picture of it for proof. or maybe you can have a copy of the receipt and have the customer sign it as well.
0 0 0 Hello. Feeling low today. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it. EOS 0 0 2 I' ve been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn' t go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint? EOS 0 0 4 Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don' t have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions. EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress. EOS 0 0 6 Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products. I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. Challenging face - to - face, and I have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now. What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing. EOS 0 0 8 Thanks. It helps to know that I' m not alone. Most often, I work independently my work. Involves a lot of explaining and justification. Before we just all sat in the same room and worked together. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don' t convey the meaning 100 percent. EOS 0 0 10 So, perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues? EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would personally suggest more happy hours, in case you haven' t already done so. EOS 0 0 12 Ah, something more casual? EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Holiday care packages would also be a good common ground for folks to gather around over something that is not work. EOS 0 0 14 That' s a great idea! I would love to get a care package, actually! EOS 0 1 15 [Others] Yeah maybe also virtual meditation sessions can help concentration mind and body. It doesn' t have to be hobbies of our own, but doing it as a team virtually can bring people together and boost morale.
3 0 0 Hello, is someone there? EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, my name is Jonathan. May I ask who I am speaking to today? EOS 3 0 2 Hi Jonathan, I' m Keri. EOS 3 1 3 [Greeting] Hi Keri. How are you today? EOS 3 0 4 I' m feeling a little bit down today. I' ve been feeling a little bit down a lot lately. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh no. I' m sorry to hear that. What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately? EOS 3 0 6 My ex - husband is moved in with his new girlfriend. They might get married. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh Keri, that must feel awful. Was it a recent separation between you two? EOS 3 0 8 He started dating a few months after we split up. I don' t know if this is the only person he' s dated but I think so. He really moved on quick. Hi, are you still there? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Yeah I understand what you' re going through. I was in a similar position not too long ago. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. How does it make you feel that he' s trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours? EOS 3 0 10 It makes me feel like he didn' t learn anything from our relationship or like he thinks he' s better than me because he has someone new and I don' t. I' m trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good I think, but sometimes I feel really really lonely too. Like maybe I won' t ever find anyone. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you' re doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another. EOS 3 0 12 Thank you! Exactly. But it is scary. I am guessing from your name that you identify as male( please forgive me if that is incorrect), so you might not understand what it feels like to be an older woman when your ex starts dating someone a lot younger. Men only get better and more desirable with age, not so for women. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I might not understand that particular aspect, but self worth is still self worth no matter the context. I' d say try not to pay any mind to what he' s up to. The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence, but if you just focus on watering your grass( making yourself happy) then you' ll have a much more fulfilling life. EOS 3 0 14 Haha, watering my own grass. That is a good way to put it. Thank you for talking to me for a few minutes. It makes me feel a little bit better to have someone agree that it is okay to spend time working on me, instead of thinking that it is sad or pathetic or an excuse. I really appreciate it. EOS 3 1 15 [Greeting] Oh absolutely Keri. Thanks for opening up and sharing your experience and feelings with me for just a few minutes. It was great to talk to you.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 3 0 2 well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. My life is done now. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband. EOS 3 0 4 well, I cannot say it is a new start when I will be 90 in March. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Then you' ve definitely got a lot going for you if you' re 90! EOS 3 0 6 Had. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Why did he leave you? EOS 3 0 8 He wanted a younger woman. His new girlfriend is 63. He is 45. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that is more of his problem then. You deserve someone that' s better than leaving someone because of their age. EOS 3 0 10 I thought it would be nice to have a younger man when we got married. He eventually told me he just married me for my money, and was waiting for me to pass so he could inherit all of it. He said he got tired of waiting, so he moved on to someone else. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Personally, if that' s how he felt, then you' re better off. I know that doesn' t stop the hurt you' re feeling, but you are worth more than that. EOS 3 0 12 Now I am here alone. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being single does not mean you' re completely alone. There are a lot of resources to talk to someone and make friends.
4 0 0 i cant go back to uni due to finacial issue. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Good afternoon. How may I assist you? EOS 4 0 2 good afternnon. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] What is unit? Are talking school. EOS 4 0 4 as i stated i had to cut university short and i feel like am going to finish old. EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What age are You? EOS 4 0 6 and i feel like school is my best chance to be someone and get out of the life we are in. mid twenties. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand your dilemma. I am in my 60s and desiring my degree as well. EOS 4 0 8 oh do you feel like you under achieved like you do better. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The COVID has put a lot of students is a bind. EOS 4 0 10 maybe but this is not the first time prosponding. EOS 4 1 11 [Others] No I want to study a certain field. For better understanding of the Bible. EOS 4 0 12 oh that sounds great. sometimes i feel like God is my only ally and friend. EOS 4 1 13 [Question] have you ever heard the phrase you are never to old to learn? EOS 4 0 14 Yes i have. EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Yes He truly stands by you. EOS 4 0 16 i just hope he holds me through this too, i give myself hope that he let this happen for a reason. EOS 4 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I started going to college in 94 and still going. EOS 4 0 18 wow. EOS 4 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He will see you through just keep a positive attitude. what is your field of study? EOS 4 0 20 i think i would have given up or asked God what' s his purpose with me cause i cant see it. computer engineering and information technology. EOS 4 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I know what I am after, just have to be persistent. That is a good choice of study. EOS 4 0 22 i guess so. i pray i get that too, and not give up easily. Thank you. EOS 4 1 23 [Question] Are you full time. EOS 4 0 24 yes i was. but next year am considering part time. EOS 4 1 25 [Question] What about online classes that enable you to study and work also. EOS 4 0 26 pick up work. i had a scholarship but it got cancelled when my grades dropped a bit. EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are classes you can take that can fit your schedule. EOS 4 0 28 that' s the plan next year. I have 2 more years to go. EOS 4 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But don' t give up what you started. Take classes now. See what you need and take the classes that will enable you to keep gpoing. EOS 4 0 30 i wont though two years seem like forever right now. Actually started saving up now for school next year. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Just never give up. Two years will go by quickly if you keep attending. Look for grants that will assist you. EOS 4 0 32 i really will. am going to do my best to get my family out of this place and a better life. yea am looking for every possible help i can get. but thank you so much. This was helpful. EOS 4 1 33 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So keep applying yourself and reach for your goals. Have a good day.
2 0 0 how can i find a jobs in my area. What kind of jobs open right now. EOS 2 1 1 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried the classified ads? Or check on facebook for a jobs page in your area? EOS 2 0 2 No. EOS 2 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest starting with one of those options.. do you have a resume? EOS 2 0 4 I don' t have resume. EOS 2 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest you type one up, most employers want an application and a resume. EOS 2 0 6 I will need somebody type one for me. EOS 2 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps a friend can help you, if not they have programs on the web to help assist with that. EOS 2 0 8 Thanks so much. EOS 2 1 9 [Question] Have you been out of work for a while? your welcome. EOS 2 0 10 Yes, I did, EOS 2 1 11 [Question] Are you saying you have been out of work for a while?
2 0 0 Hey. I am really scared about my job prospects. I am really fearful about my job situation. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] When did this fear start? EOS 2 0 2 It has been a while. I have had fears going back to my childhood traumas. I think that the work situation has only exacerbated that. The current economic climate has really made me fearful.... not sure if I am going to be able to keep my job. EOS 2 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct? EOS 2 0 4 Somewhat. But, my fears are relevant because I don' t know if I will always have a job. EOS 2 1 5 [Question] Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job? EOS 2 0 6 Do you know what I mean? What say u? I have some, but they have their own problems to deal with. Everyone has problems. Do you know what I mean? EOS 2 1 7 [Self-disclosure] You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me. EOS 2 0 8 It is making me have flashbacks of other traumatic situations, I think I need to find a good support chain, for sure. What say u? You take alooonnng time to respond. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many counselors who specialize in this field of job security and especially during this pandemic and the falling economy, they are great support systems. EOS 2 0 10 I am having a hard time.... Ok, I will look some of them online. I need some financial planners to help as well. Many Americans are hurting. EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic. EOS 2 0 12 Any other advices? What else can you advise me on? Should I look elsewhere for jobs? I will have to try that. Maybe it can help me ease my mind. EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Since a lot of this stress is being caused by your childhood trauma, it seems like there is something that connects that job to your trauma and if it cant be disconnected, it seems like you should find another job. And I understand that is not the easiest in these times but I believe you can do it! EOS 2 0 14 It is not easy right now. That' s for sure.. I am wondering if I could do Lyft or Uber. I think a side hustle could work, perhaps? EOS 2 1 15 [Question] Do you think those jobs would help you disconnect your childhood trauma and work life? EOS 2 0 16 Do you think I am thinking rationally? I could give it a try.... Childhood traumas are tough for sure. I am a fearful person. EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Just giving it a try is what starts every journey and I am proud of you for taking that leap! EOS 2 0 18 Thanks a lot. I appreciate you support.:) I think that your advice will help. Thank you for the chat. EOS 2 1 19 [Greeting] No problem I hope all goes well for you and I hope you stay safe. EOS 2 0 20 Thank you. Good bye. EOS 2 1 21 [Greeting] Goodbye!
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:) EOS 2 0 7 It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am in the UK. It' s sort of a grey area... police won' t really do anything but you can' t buy it over the counter. EOS 2 0 9 One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I' m very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially. EOS 2 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot. The US seems to be really strict on it tho. EOS 2 0 11 It varies, state by state, depending on which party is governing. Which you of course have a version of in the UK. Mayoral elections were today yeah? EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] They were but I didn' t pay much attention:) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that' s all. EOS 2 0 13 Oh, well, I' m sorry to hear that. I think participation in local governance is actually the most achievable path for change, but perhaps how it' s structured where you are, it wouldn' t really matter much if you participated. I guess mayorals are only technically local, not like parliamentary elections. EOS 2 1 14 [Others] If I were in London or a major city I' d vote for Mayor. I am in a rural area and we don' t have one: D. I vote for local councillors tho. EOS 2 0 15 Oh, I take it to mean that you are anti - Khan? If you feel like you' d need to vote for mayor in London. EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I like Khan:) EOS 2 0 17 Jeremy Corbyn, no surrender? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I like him too lol. EOS 2 0 19 You sound like someone I' d like to smoke a spliff with In a moderated manner of course, in relevance to the topic I opened with. EOS 2 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] But I don' t get to vote for London mayor. Only if I were a London resident or nearby would I( sorry for tortured syntax)
1 0 0 I am so mad that I can' t see straight. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello! What is on your mind today? Oh really? Why is that? EOS 1 0 2 Well, my boyfriend has cheated so many times that I cant count them. I then meet someone nice and cheat on him once and now he breaks up with me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] being mad that your boyfriend cheated is normal. being mad when dumped is normal. don' t you think you DESERVE better than he was treating you?
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Somewhat stressed but otherwise ok. How about you? EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I am great, it snowed and looks like Christmas here. Why are you so stressed? EOS 0 0 4 I' m developing romantic feelings for a friend but she doesn' t share those feelings with me in return. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. I have been there myself.. Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend? EOS 0 0 6 Yes, I had received that advice from someone and tried it but it didn' t help. We have been friends for a long time and I think it would be tough to smother these romantic feelings. EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Have you thought about talking with this friend about these feelings? EOS 0 0 8 I have but I' m sure she wouldn' t react very well and it could damage our relationship.. I' m also pretty sure she' s already aware. She' s pretty sharp. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well maybe you should address these feelings with her in a very relaxed public atmosphere. Just let her know that you really like her and you have realized that she has many of the qualities that you look for in a person to get serious with. However, you treasure your friendship more than anything and you do not want anything to come in between your friendship.... this way you have addressed your feelings, she knows how you feel and then should she decide to every take the friendship to the next step, she wouldn' t feel awkward. EOS 0 0 10 That sounds like a good plan. I do like having things out in the open instead of holding them in. My other thought was to maybe try to seek out a romantic partner that isn' t her so then maybe the feelings would go to another focus and it wouldn' t damage our relatinship. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a great idea. Have you been dating other people much? EOS 0 0 12 No, it has been difficult with the whole Corona virus thing. I have taken a large income hit and also I' m having trouble finding someone who wants to actually go do something. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes the Corona virus has really put a damper on all kinds of normal activities. Have you thought about joining like a group with similar interests as yourself? Maybe look for a local group that has a Facebook page and you can start with building friendships just by chatting online or even on the public page itself. Some of the best lasting relationships start out as friends with similar interests and then they blossom. EOS 0 0 14 I think I' ll give that a try. I could use a new hobby anyways. EOS 0 1 15 [Greeting] Sounds like a great plan, how are you feeling now? EOS 0 0 16 I feel a lot better nwo that I have some options. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s great, sometimes just being able to talk through things with someone else, really helps to get things in perspective and brainstorm some new ideas. I am glad you are feeling better and hope that you have a great rest of your day. EOS 0 0 18 Yes, thank you. And you also have a great day. EOS 0 1 19 [Greeting] Good Bye.
3 0 0 Hi, how are you today? I feel really sad all the time. I don' t know why. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] hello. you feel sad, why? EOS 3 0 2 I' m not sure. I can' t find a reason. My health is fine. I have friends. I have a place to live. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] your health is fine and you have place to live but you are still sad. EOS 3 0 4 Yes, that' s right. I feel like my life is not going in the right direction. In fact, I' m not going anywhere. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] have you talked to anyone about it. EOS 3 0 6 No, not really. I don' t know what to talk about. I just feel flat. Something' s wrong. I don' t know what. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i have felt that way before but i came over it. EOS 3 0 8 How did you do that? I really need some guidance here. What do I do? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] it came to me like a mood swing for so many days but i started going to meet friends and get closer to my friends for positive vibes. EOS 3 0 10 You met with your friends? I' ve tried meeting with my friends. I feel ok when I' m with them, but then later, I feel sad again. I can' t spend all my time with my friends, of course. They have things to do. So do I. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, you have to be positive at all time and always do something that makes you happy.
3 0 0 Hi. I am Mike. Live in central Kansas and have been very depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that, is there a particular reason or instance for you feeling this way? EOS 3 0 2 I lost my job due to Covid and they have shut down for good. no jobs around here and no vehicle so i feel hopeless and hate my living situation. just before covid hit i was saving to move... but then job closed. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes that is a very tough situation, Covid has real placed a large amount of stress through out the world. There may be a ray of hope however with a possible vaccine in the near future, maybe this will be back to normal soon and new jobs will become available. EOS 3 0 4 I hope so and that is what i know mentally. but emotionally it is hard. i just hate having no job, being at home, no money, no vehicle, and a very bad idea to date since there is a high contagious pandemic. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand and you are right it is a a lot of mental stress. Have you reached out to claim unemployment or go to a food pantry? During this pandemic you should not feel shameful to take advantage of these services, there are alot of people who have to ask for help for the first time in their lives.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello there, can I help you with any today?* anything. I am happy to talk to you about any problem that you might be having? EOS 4 0 1 I am having such a difficult time today!!! EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you. EOS 4 0 3 I think that my boyfriend is cheating on me again!!! EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Are you saying that he has cheated on you before? That does not sound very promising. EOS 4 0 5 He has but it was a long time ago and was before we had a talk about exclusivity in our relationship but it still hurt. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Have you considered getting some sort of couples counselling? Or do you just think that he is never going to change? EOS 4 0 7 We tried counselling once.. It was online and we got paid to do it.. I don' t think he took it seriously at the time. He always said he felt like he was being attacked. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. So you feel that he is not really taking your problems as a couple seriously?
0 0 0 I am really feeling the loneliness of the season and being isolated. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Good evening. EOS 0 0 2 Good evening. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just so I understand, the holiday season is making you feel alone and isolated. EOS 0 0 4 Yes as well as the virus. Are we out of time. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Is there anything in particular about the holidays that is bothering you? EOS 0 0 6 Just no family around. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I am also far away from my family for the holidays, so I know how hard that is. EOS 0 0 8 The virus this year does not help. EOS 0 1 9 [Others] Not at all. EOS 0 0 10 ARe you affected by the virus. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about setting up some video calls with your family during the holidays? I know a lot of people are doing that so they can feel closer to the family during these tough times/ I have not been able to travel as much due to the virus. EOS 0 0 12 I thought about he videos but my daughter lives in California. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is tough, but I definitely think setting up a time to chat with her would help a lot!
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 hi. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How are you? EOS 0 0 3 Ive been better. Stressful day. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Ohh.. sorry to hear that. Would you mind sharing what is going on? EOS 0 0 5 Long story short, im a recovering alcoholic, 52 days sober, however my mental health has hit me with vengeance and am really struggling day to day. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You are getting out of alcoholism and feeling bad about it emotionally, is that right? EOS 0 0 7 i used alcohol as a self medication. It helped keep bad symtoms of ADHD away. I miss what alcohol used to do for me. EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I understand you pain and frustration. I have very close friend who has ADHD and trying to cope with it. EOS 0 0 9 Thankyou for allowing me some of your time. I would be so much better if my heart wasnt poorly. I could then be medicated properly. As of now i just have to live with it. Kinda sucks. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Are you seeing any counselor to address your challenge?
0 0 0 hey. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m good, busy. I need another job to pay more bills. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having a difficult time with your finances. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 yes somewhat. i can pay it off within 2 - 3 years without a second job. id like to pay it off faster though. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure it will take dedication and hard work, but I bet you can do it! EOS 0 0 6 I think so. Im doing mturk for a second job right now. it helps some. i don' t know about getting another job. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been in your shoes and also feel that' s a good way to add a little extra income. It can really add up if left to built and used towards a specific goal. EOS 0 0 8 I agree 100%. Been spending it on new clothes and toiletries lately to stock up for the covid shutdown. the extra money helps alot. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It definitely can help. Perhaps you could have a separate way of using some of the money to go towards some of the other bills you would like to pay off? Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns. EOS 0 0 10 i currently do that. it' s hard to have the patience to pay it off. i hate having debt hanging over my head. i like to have nice things though and they cost money. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Yes, and I have found this can be a good way to provide for the extra luxuries we like, without taking away from money that' s used towards household bills. EOS 0 0 12 absolutely. i make sure all of my household bills are paid every month. i think it will get better once these debts are paid off. i needed a lot of new things at once since the old had worn out. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to use some of the scripts that can be added that allows you to catch hits that are hard to get on Mturk? They can be very helpful. Also, there are forums that have all kinds of useful information for workers. EOS 0 0 14 no i haven' t tried those yet. do i have to pay for those scripts? EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You might find it useful to do a little research and add them as extensions to Chrome or whatever browser you use. They are free and pretty simple to use. EOS 0 0 16 So I could make more money on mturk than I am now by using those? EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] They have helped me in being able to get a bit more extra income. The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It' s easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over. The forums can a large amount of help too. Perhaps try MTS. They also can show exactly how much you end up making per hour, filter by monetary amount of hits, etc. EOS 0 0 18 oh wow, thank ya! I' ll look into that. MTS is a script? Which script should I use? EOS 0 1 19 [Greeting] Of course, I hope it can be of use too you! One I use is Mechanical Turk Suite, which is an extension. I think you can look up as a search for extensions, scripts etc. Or Mturk forums and find out tons of help!

EOS 4 0 6 and i feel like school is my best chance to be someone and get out of the life we are in. mid twenties. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand your dilemma. I am in my 60s and desiring my degree as well. EOS 4 0 8 oh do you feel like you under achieved like you do better. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The COVID has put a lot of students is a bind. EOS 4 0 10 maybe but this is not the first time prosponding. EOS 4 1 11 [Others] No I want to study a certain field. For better understanding of the Bible. EOS 4 0 12 oh that sounds great. sometimes i feel like God is my only ally and friend. EOS 4 1 13 [Question] have you ever heard the phrase you are never to old to learn?
2 0 0 hi. EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hey! How are you? EOS 2 0 2 trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once:( EOS 2 1 3 [Question] What are these thoughts?:) EOS 2 0 4 Its so stupid. I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts just come so fast. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while. EOS 2 0 6 tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes I cant controll the thoughts or like I dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing. EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] A chemical thing, so maybe you need a counsellor, and then he can assess your problem, and everything will be alright:) EOS 2 0 8 I have one and it helps sometimes. I try to meditate. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. Does it help you? If it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently. EOS 2 0 10 i pretty much have to do it constantly. EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not constantly. because then you won' t have anytime to do anything else, but if negative thoughts always come into your head, maybe try doing something you enjoy doing. EOS 2 0 12 yeah maybe its as simple as that. I know Im the problem cause its very obvious that im the on ein control of the thoughts for the most part. EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, maybe. But always look at the bright side of stuff and maybe the negative thoughts can stop. EOS 2 0 14 right. I will try and start that more today and commit to it. EOS 2 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes that' s the spirit! And with that mind set good things will always come to you! EOS 2 0 16 yes i agree. when i consistently use meditation and positive attitude, any bad things are defintely minimized. EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, as long as you keep focused and not divert into any other thoughts:)
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave? EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad. EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more. I feel that everyone must know that I' ve been dumped and be laughing at me. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time. EOS 1 0 10 I did not really have any choice though. I do not see any future for myself now that we are separated. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] do you know brene brown and her work. EOS 1 0 12 No I do not, who is that? EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her TED talk and there' s a great youtube video on empathy. EOS 1 0 14 Thank you, I will. Right now I really need some sort of emotional support. I feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i bring her up because what i sounds like is that you are feeling embarrassed because your partner made a choice that wasn' t you. in reality the choice they made wasn' t about you, it was about them. EOS 1 0 16 It is not so much that - it is that I feel that I dedicated the majority of my adult life to this relationship and now there is nothing left. EOS 1 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are left and you are enough. even if you dont feel like it right now you are enough. EOS 1 0 18 I really do not feel like it right now. What was the last fifteen years all about? I wanted to have children with him and he refused but now I hear he is expecting a baby with another woman. EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] a relationship is part of who you are. it isn' t you. EOS 1 0 20 But it is very difficult to try to strike out on my own again and I do not know if I even want to. EOS 1 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it is hard. it sucks. but the voyage through the suck is going to be better for you than you may realize right now. EOS 1 0 22 But I feel that I am facing middle age on my own and I really do not want to do that. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you have survived 14 days without a bad relationship. keep on doing that day by day and before you know it, you will be on the other side of the bad feelings. EOS 1 0 24 What happens if I just can' t ever get over it though? Right now it' s hard to see any sort of way through these feelings. EOS 1 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, middle age is scary, but there are so many things you can do. ageism is out. EOS 1 0 26 I feel I might have missed out on my chance to have a family of my own though, because I waited fifteen years and my partner would not go for that. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] please watch the cartoon animals and brene brown on youtube talk about empathy. find one of your friends who has been through the suck and let them help you find your path out. EOS 1 0 28 Most of my friends seem to be very happily coupled up right now. They are sympathetic but they do not really understand. EOS 1 1 29 [Self-disclosure] i had an emergency ovary removal in my early 30s and didn' t know if i woudl be able to have children. my doctor told me that the most important thing i could do was to be healthy becuse a healthy mother was what i could give my children even if i adopted them.
4 0 0 Hi. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing these days? EOS 4 0 2 Not good. You? EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry to hear that. I am doing fine and hope I can cheer you up. EOS 4 0 4 Good to hear. Been feeling lonely due to this pandemic. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I totally understand it. I felt lonely too by staying home all the time. But I found we can borrow books online. A good book can really help. EOS 4 0 6 Do you mean physical or ebooks? EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Both will help. But ebooks are easier to get and you don' t need to contact anyone and anything outside your home. EOS 4 0 8 Any genres you would suggest? EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I like biographies. Stories of real people are inspiring. EOS 4 0 10 Oh ok. I was thinking about getting a dog, is that a good idea? EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a great idea! Dog is human' s best friend. I would love to have a dog myself. EOS 4 0 12 Do you have any dogs? EOS 4 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I don' t have a dog, because I like to travel. However I have taken care of other people' s dogs a lot when I am home. EOS 4 0 14 Oh ok. There is a lock down from where I live, how about you? EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] We are in similar situation. These days I only go out for grocery shopping. EOS 4 0 16 Same situation. I fear for the worse. Economy seems to be on a downturn. EOS 4 1 17 [Others] Yeah, economy cannot do well if this situation drags on. Hope the vaccine will soon be approved and life can be back to normal.
1 1 0 [Question] Hi - how are you today? EOS 1 0 1 hey! an doing better but things at work place gets me real down. EOS 1 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What' s going on at work that' s making you upset? EOS 1 0 3 i think boss hate me. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That can be very uncomfortable. Are there reason you feel that way? EOS 1 0 5 nothing i do pleases the man. all he does is complain. EOS 1 1 6 [Question] Ugh - is he like this with everyone else, too - or do you think it' s just directed at you? EOS 1 0 7 i think its directed to me. EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Can you give an example and then maybe we can replay it a different way? EOS 1 0 9 if am asked to complete a task, i do complete them and make sure no mistake was made, if he will evaluate the task he always sees fault in what i do. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hmm= that is frustrating. Can you sit with him and go over each section that he finds fault with and ask how he would have done it? EOS 1 0 11 he never give time to listen. i think i' ll quit the job. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe talk to his secretary and make an appointment with him. don' t quit the job unless you have another one lined up.. EOS 1 0 13 i never tried talking to his secretary. i think that' s a good idea. EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she' s your first line to getting alone time with him! she' ll get you an appointment for sure! EOS 1 0 15 i try doing just that, i hope it works. EOS 1 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] good. I wish you the best of luck! In the meantime it' s never bad to put out feelers( discreetly) for other jobs..
4 1 0 [Question] Good evening. What would you like to talk about? EOS 4 0 1 evening. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you feeling at the moment? EOS 4 0 3 i lost those books, I cannot even explain, how it happen. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have lost some books? Were they important to you? EOS 4 0 5 I price one of the books, Amazon said 1000. yes. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] So you have lost a book that is worth a thousand dollars? I can imagine you are feeling really bad about that.
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be.

I do not see any future for myself now that we are separated. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] do you know brene brown and her work. EOS 1 0 12 No I do not, who is that?

Right now I really need some sort of emotional support. I feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste.

EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] a relationship is part of who you are. it isn' t you.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 hi. Could you please help?. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How are you tonight?. EOS 3 0 3 I am okay. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 3 0 5 I caught my gf texting another guy. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So from what I understand, you caught your significant other texting someone else.. EOS 3 0 7 yes right. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] What types of things was she texting him about? EOS 3 0 9 Asking about what he was doing later. What he likes to do for fun. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Just from the few messages we have sent, I can tell you are very anxious and upset about this situation.. EOS 3 0 11 yes for sure, i was so shocked and disappointed. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand this as I had issues with my ex fiancé texting other guys and cheating on me.. EOS 3 0 13 Oh no! thats horrible too. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how hard a situation like this is, but I know you can get through it! EOS 3 0 15 Thanks so much! I think I can too. Thanks for sharing with me. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to have a conversation with her about it? EOS 3 0 17 No I feel like she should come to me about it since she was caught. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] What if she doesn' t know you caught her?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi! What' s on your mind tonight?. EOS 4 0 1 I think a friend I' ve known for 30 years since college has drifted away from me. Even during the pandemic she has made new friends. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, I' m sorry, that' s not fun at all, especially since you two have been friends for so long. Have you tried reaching out to her by phone, email or social media?. EOS 4 0 3 She has cut our conversations short by saying she is tried. She will return text but I feel like I am always initiating. She likes watching tv show and told me with her NEW friend they Facetime and watch TV together. I really hate watching TV so don' t want to offer to participate. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, it' s a positive sign that she hasn' t blocked you completely. I agree, texting her each day could irritate her. That' s okay! You shouldn' t do anything that isn' t fun or enjoyable or comfortable for either of you, in my opinion. EOS 4 0 5 I am jealous that she is more successful in making new friends. I have not made a new friend in over 10 years. EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life. EOS 4 0 7 I don' t have many other friends and they are out of state. The one we are talking about lived an hour away but we would see each other 4 to 6 times a year, EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you' re saying you feel hurt and depressed at not being able to make new friends easily in the pandemic, correct? Ahhhh.,..... yes that; s difficult, oh boy. EOS 4 0 9 Hurt, mad, jealous. I have trouble getting out enough to make friends - even if there wasn' t a pandemic. I work a lot. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] For the time being we' re all stuck at home mostly, so maybe take some comfort in that in a strange way. Heck I rarely see my friends - maybe once a year, so I know how that feels. EOS 4 0 11 Good to know I' m not alone. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] On the bright side of things, at least you have a job. Do you enjoy your job? Maybe start friendships with coworkers, possibly.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you. EOS 3 0 1 Not doing well. I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Oh no, how long had you been together? EOS 3 0 3 we were together for 2 years. It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Wow, that' s horrible. How do you feel about it? EOS 3 0 5 I feel lost. I' m so used to her being around everyday. Now I don' t know what to do with myself without her. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year.
0 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? I am feeling rather sad. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hi there. Yes, What is making you sad? EOS 0 0 2 I feel that my friends do not like me very much any more. Apparently they have been engaging in group activities without me. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities. EOS 0 0 4 Do you think that I am over - reacting? I do not want to sound over sensitive but this has been happening for a while. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you talked with your friends on how you feel? When was the last time you all connected? EOS 0 0 6 We went out for coffee the other day and I thought about saying something cos I know they went to a club without me last weekend but I couldn' t bring myself to in the end. EOS 0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand it is tough to bring up what is bothering you, especially after getting to hang out with all your friend over coffee. I' m sure this was not intentional with not inviting you to the club. EOS 0 0 8 Sometimes in the past I have turned down invitations to go out clubbing, admittedly. Could it be that they just did not think that I wanted to go?. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] From what I have experienced personally, I am not a fan of clubs and didnt want to go with my friends. After turning them down a few times, they stopped inviting as well. I think they thought that was not my thing. EOS 0 0 10 The thing is though that this is not the only thing - they have been to rock concerts without me too. I just feel I am no longer a part of the group. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I feel how this is hurting you. The best thing would be to talk to them about feeling disinvited to group activities. Let them know you are still free and really want to spend some time together. Do you think you can open up to them on whats bothering you? EOS 0 0 12 I don' t know. I don' t want to come across as just being paranoid or whiny. Sometimes I think it would be better to just forget them and not have any friends. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like this situation is really bothering you. Its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated. The bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation. If they don' t know what is bothering you, it will be harder to mend the relationship. EOS 0 0 14 It is making me really depressed and is badly damaging my sense of self worth. I feel as though I am not worth anyone' s time. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You are worth every precious second of time and should not let this diminish your self worth. Find common ground, an activity you all enjoy and invite them to hang with you. EOS 0 0 16 Thank you that is helpful. What if I reach out and they all snub me though? EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] We all have busy hectic lives at time. True friends make time to be with one another. This world is full of beautiful people to bond with. Keeping a closed circle of friends is a blessing.
4 1 0 [Question] Hey there, what' s going on today? EOS 4 0 1 Hello. It is a fine day, how about yourself? EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] It really is! I am just taking in the fresh air in the backyard. EOS 4 0 3 That is awesome. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Thanks! What is going on in your neck of the woods? EOS 4 0 5 Sort of stuck inside trying to make a dime but it is alright. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Yeah great minds think alike.. do you do anything else for work? EOS 4 0 7 Looking for a good job right now. I wanted to talk about a personal issue I have been having, though. EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Okay, you know I' m here for you. Talk to me, what' s happening? EOS 4 0 9 My father and I had a fight 2 years ago and haven' t spoke since. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] The same happened to me, and then my father passed away. If there is anything I can say, is to swallow pride and cherish the moments you have on earth together. What was the fight over? EOS 4 0 11 Yeah I am afraid that these things can happen. It was only over material things. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] That was my next question, what the fight was over. Do you think he would be open to mending things? EOS 4 0 13 It is weird because I called him out for being manipulative so this is his defense.. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Usually when people feel singled out, they only have a few mechanisms. Unfortunately, most people tend to run away instead of fixing things. It tends to be the easier option. EOS 4 0 15 I would likely take advantage of an opportunity to be the bigger person. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] When you try to fix things, just remember that this is his method. I wouldn' t hold back on what you have to say, but just word it so that he doesn' t feel the need to flee. EOS 4 0 17 That is probably decent advice. EOS 4 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is HIS responsibility as a parent to want to fix things, but you are also being the bigger person here. I applaud you and hope that he is receptive.
3 0 0 hello. anyone there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with today? EOS 3 0 2 am not fine. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What is it that is making you feel this way? EOS 3 0 4 i was cheated on severally, and it resulted me to end the relationship. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you had to deal with a partner recently cheating and a breakup, is this right? EOS 3 0 6 yes thats it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this has been stressful for you and you are trying to figure out how to move on from this. EOS 3 0 8 exactly, i can tend to focus because i have given so much time and affection, i never thought i would be called the fool after everything i did. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is incredibly difficult to get something like this off your mind and it seems like you are trying your best to move forward with your life. EOS 3 0 10 i want to move on but i dont know how, i tried to but i just cant. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I have been through this, I learned how to keep myself busy and do things that I enjoy to occupy my mind and let time heal those wounds. EOS 3 0 12 i think you right, maybe i should renew my netflix sub, since i find great interest in movies so as to get some positive vibes and think less of this whole situation. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Science shows that during a breakup sometimes you romanticize the relationship and view it as better than it actually was and missing something that wasn' t as good as you thought.
3 0 0 Hello. Hello? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hey how are you doing?. EOS 3 0 2 Doing alright, thanks. Yourself? EOS 3 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing fine, thank you.. EOS 3 0 4 Good to hear. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 6 I' ve been feeling very down lately. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] That sounds difficult, Would you like to elaborate on that? EOS 3 0 8 Sure. I feel depressed about the state of the US and of the rest of the world. It' s very overwhelming.. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now. EOS 3 0 10 Yes and a lot of uncetainty. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Most definitely, I' ve also been feeling a bit overwhelmed by what' s going on. How have you been coping? EOS 3 0 12 It' s good to know others feel the way I do. I' ve been trying to keep busy and not watch the news too much. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a good strategy, all the news outlets can be very overwhelming. EOS 3 0 14 Yes with lots of conflicting information. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] What do you like to do to keep busy? EOS 3 0 16 Work, read, exercise. I' ve been going to the gym more. EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Those sound like really good coping skills. EOS 3 0 18 Thank you. I' m trying. I really don' t want to be on medication. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a personal choice you' re completely allowed to make. It sounds like you have a good foundation for building on your ability to cope.
3 0 0 hi im sad. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Anything particular got you down? Hello. EOS 3 0 2 just life, bad year. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea bad year for everyone. The virus has really stopped us. Are you working or on layoff. EOS 3 0 4 yes it has, the political turmoil in the United States is very scary as well. I am self employed. but not working alot. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is an understatement with the politics. What do you do. EOS 3 0 6 I am a writer. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I Freelance my self. Do you work for anyone or just in general. EOS 3 0 8 mostly sights that talk about movies. there are a few i submit to. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Good. I write on a forum called Medium. I write and can get paid also. EOS 3 0 10 oh yes i know that one. EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There are various topics you can write about. Just write and post. Are you a copywriter.
2 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are we doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Okay how are you? EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Im doing great thanks. Anything on your mind today? EOS 2 0 3 Just pondering microcheating and wondering why someone who I do not like that way would be considered microcheating. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] And what do you mean by microcheating? EOS 2 0 5 It is a new thing like having a man you like that you check up on on social media even though you are in a relationship, or eating lunch with the same woman or man that you like but you don' t act on because you are married. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh i see, well i think overthinking things like that can lead to unwanted emotions. Or putting yourself in a situation with another person when you are in a relationship might mean there are other issues going on.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 Hi, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Greeting] Doing good.. How are you? EOS 0 0 3 I' m feeling really anxious these days. I' m finding the COVID online learning experience to be too much for me at this time. I want to stop school, but I don' t think I can afford to. I need to get done with school. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand your frustration. All of us are challenged due to COVID. EOS 0 0 5 School was always hard. Now it' s gotten harder. I think a lot of people are stressed.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] How long are you doing the online school? EOS 0 0 7 Last semester and this semester. It feels like a lot longer though. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What are you missing most? Friends?
6 0 0 I am having a really hard time with something that I did to my boyfriend. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Do you want to talk about it? EOS 6 0 2 Yes, thank you! I was with him since childhood and we are actually still together. I slipped up one night and hate to admit what I did. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you' re holding onto a lot of guilt about this incident. Are you comfortable talking about that night? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, it is intense guilt. I can' t think of anything else. I hate to tell you but I cheated on him. I am so sorry and can' t look at myself in the mirror. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That can really weigh you down, beating yourself up with guilt. Does he know about the incident? EOS 6 0 6 I feel like I am worthless and I don' t deserve to ever be happy or laugh again. I really do love him and I don' t ever want him to find out what I did. Yes, I cant stop beating myself up. He doesn' t know what I did but he is little suspicious. EOS 6 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You definitely deserve to laugh and be happy. One mistake doesn' t define you! EOS 6 0 8 Thank you! A long time ago his sister told me that he cheated on me and I believed her and so I wanted to get him back. EOS 6 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It says a lot about your character that you feel badly about this, that you can see and recognize you acted in a way you don' t agree with. That' s something to build on. That desire to" get even" is definitely understandable. EOS 6 0 10 I appreciate that and have been thinking about character a lot lately. I do believe he cheated on me first, if that even matters now. EOS 6 1 11 [Question] Do you feel like you got what you needed from the experience, as in, that you' ve" gotten even"?
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state. EOS 0 0 6 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well. EOS 0 0 8 Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing( which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all. I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out. EOS 0 0 10 What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job: it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. Working there would be ministry, not typical work. And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, that' s a big deal. i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it. EOS 0 0 12 Thank you. I believe there are three things in my favor: I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current( related) job fifteen years ago. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] even by working there, you will surely meet new friends. do you know many people from the church? EOS 0 0 14 We worked together for almost 13 years before she retired, but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer/ work partner? I know a few of the higher ups from the area churches, and a handful of families. I know half the core staff I would be working with daily and think of them as extended family.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you just have to be patient and don' t push it too hard so that you won' t look desperate. EOS 0 0 16 The benefits are nice, also, such as staff are provided meals prepared by the banquet chef and his team when at work. And though everyone has a role, the office staff support each other well and work as a team. EOS 0 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, banquet at work. that is a wonderland stuff. EOS 0 0 18 At the risk of preaching religion, I believe God may be calling me to serve there.. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is definitely a dream job. God is everywhere. just put your trust in Him. He never sleep nor slumber. EOS 0 0 20 When off duty, staff are encouraged to enjoy the facilities and mingle with guests. There is an Olympic sized pool, field games, a gymnasium, an exercise room, and if off duty, one can attend most any of the events on the campus, unless designated as a private event. EOS 0 1 21 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow! Olympic size pool. Keep praying. the job is yours.

EOS 0 0 4 It has been around 4 months now. It started slowly and now has ramped up to where it' s exploding and causing discourse among us all. One of my friends told a secret to another acquaintance outside of our group. My friend is raging over this which she should. trust was broken.

EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Well, it sounds like you are in a tough spot since both your friends are so mad at each other.. Why do you think your one friends shared a secret they were supposed to keep?
4 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello, How are you today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m really depressed. My fiance left me yesterday. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it? EOS 4 0 3 Yes, I think that might make me feel better. I really have no one to talk to because my family and friends didn' t like him so they think this is for the best. EOS 4 1 4 [Greeting] Ok. I am happy to listen.. EOS 4 0 5 I just don' t understand why someone would pretend to be happy for a year and then decide they were lying and leave. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Seems like you feel your partner betrayed you, does that sound right?. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I feel very betrayed.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is understandable. I know how you feel, may I suggest taking a few minutes to clear your head, and making a plan to talk with your friends and parents about how you feel? EOS 4 0 9 They think I should just get over it because they didn' t like him so they think I shouldn' t like him either. They' re making things worse for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] Oh I' m so sorry, sometimes family and friends don' t think about your feelings. When did this happen? EOS 4 0 11 He left yesterday. I had no warning. He just packed up all his stuff and said he didn' t want to marry me and the last year has been a lie. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Dang. he seems very selfish. But I understand how up setting it must have felt. My first husband left me without warning. EOS 4 0 13 I' m sorry to hear that. How long did it take you to feel better? EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Awhile. it started to feel a little bit better after I kept telling myself it was about him and not about me, then I started feeling a bit better. But it will take time, the old say is correct, good days and bad days.. EOS 4 0 15 What did you do to help feel better> EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Started back in to my routine. Work. Church. things like that.. EOS 4 0 17 I think it' s harder that it' s during the holidays because I don' t go back to work until after the new year. I thought we would be spending the next week together at home. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] My I suggestion you pick your closest friend, and talk to her/ him about your feeling, but not about your boyfriend, about how you feel your friends have been treating you. Be nice but firm. I bet once they hear your pain, they will be very supportive. EOS 4 0 19 Hopefully. I could really use to sit down with a friend right now and spend some quality time. I don' t want to be alone all week. EOS 4 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that! it is very reasonable to want to be around family and friends during the holidays. EOS 4 0 21 Thanks for chatting with me. I feel a little more relaxed now. EOS 4 1 22 [Greeting] Good! I' m glad helped, even if just a little.

7 0 0 Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well. EOS 7 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well I can help you study if you' d like? EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material... EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study! EOS 7 0 4 My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted. EOS 7 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version. EOS 7 0 6 Wow, that' s actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me. EOS 7 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot. EOS 7 0 8 That is true. I will reach out to her now. EOS 7 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will do just fine, you can do it! EOS 7 0 10 I still have some self - doubt given that I have failed an exam in the past... EOS 7 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam. EOS 7 0 12 I really appreciate this advice. I am feeling better about the exam and feel like I should envision myself passing and doing well. EOS 7 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, thats the spirit it works for me!

She lives with her husband. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] How long has it been since she moved in. EOS 4 0 18 A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you thought about a housewarming gift. EOS 4 0 20 Hmm, no I didn' t think about that, that may be a good idea. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So just a week and she is settling in. EOS 4 0 22 Yes, but the home came furnished and honestly, I didn' t think there was that much to do, but maybe I should get a gift, to break the ice. EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Friendship is important maybe she needs to hear from you. EOS 4 0 24 Yes, it is very important, I just felt if I called I would be bothering her:( EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style. EOS 4 0 26 That is possible, and it is a HUGE house, 4 stories. EOS 4 1 27 [Question] Have you tried to visit her and see if you can help. EOS 4 0 28 No, we are not seeing each other in person due to COVID. Do you think I should try calling or texting first? EOS 4 1 29 [Reflection of feelings] sometimes people get overwhelmed and need a friend to be there. EOS 4 0 30 Yes, they certainly do, darn COVID stops everything. EOS 4 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would be a great idea, especially with the holidays. EOS 4 0 32 Would a text be more appropriate vs. a phone call? What do you think? EOS 4 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah the virus has stopped a lot of people. EOS 4 0 34 I just feel so hurt and abandoned, like I don' t mean anything to her. EOS 4 1 35 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Why not text her 1st to break the ice. But maybe she is feeling like she is alone also. EOS 4 0 36 Well, I think I will try that, I mean, it' s not that intrusive. I hope she' s not feeling alone, I hope she doesn' t think I' m abandoning her! EOS 4 1 37 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The virus is stopping people but we can find away. Does she have other family. EOS 4 0 38 I am going to send her a message, do you think I should get her a digital gift card as a gift? Yes, she has a son in college. EOS 4 1 39 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The card could be a nice gift. EOS 4 0 40 I think I will text her and let her know I' m sending a gift card.... maybe she will respond. EOS 4 1 41 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Text and ask about her son.
4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 i feel depresed. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Why do you feel depressed? EOS 4 0 3 breakup with my partner. EOS 4 1 4 [Others] Breakups can be really tough. How long were you with your partner? EOS 4 0 5 3years of time we have been in love. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I once had a relationship end after 5 years with a partner. Staying active really helped me get over the relationship. Through that activity I actually met my new partner! EOS 4 0 7 but i love my partner so much that i couldnt forget her right now. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about doing something fun, like taking a trip somewhere? EOS 4 0 9 yeah we went for trip we had a god relationship. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really difficult, but I know you can get through this! What do you like to do for fun? EOS 4 0 11 we had enjoyment and romance. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about fun activities you did without your partner? EOS 4 0 13 none i love her so much so i have not done anything without her. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] What about before you met her? EOS 4 0 15 i was doing good. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] What did you do for fun before you met her? EOS 4 0 17 sighting girls. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I loved doing that too! Have you thought about going out and doing that with your friends now? EOS 4 0 19 yes. after having a chat with you i feel some goodness in me. EOS 4 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Good! From talking to you I can tell that you have a lot of goodness in you!
1 0 0 Hi. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello though, how has life been treating you lately? EOS 1 0 2 It' s been a pretty crazy year. I' m mostly bummed because of my work. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It has been a really weird year hasn' t it? Don' t worry, I think it' s been the same for all of us. Would you like to tell me more details? EOS 1 0 4 Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else' s pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss( the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That really sucks! I can understand why you are angry and anxious about this and you have every right to be!. Are there any official routes that you can use to complain? EOS 1 0 6 I work in supply chain and I see the actual sales numbers and realized 4 months ago that we were actually on track to exceed our plans, even with the covid reductions. a few weeks later I heard him tell our sales director to keep the numbers artificially low so that they will both get their bonuses. I don' t think so... He' s the VP there isn' t anyone I can go to above him. EOS 1 1 7 [Others] That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint?. It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this. EOS 1 0 8 I don' t know if it is or not... I used my EAP benefit through work where you can talk to a councilor for free( 5 visits) and they said that it' s unfortunate but they didn' t think it was illegal. EOS 1 1 9 [Others] I am very sorry to hear that, that sounds extremely unfair to me. Have you considered looking for another job? I realise it' s a very difficult time to be looking for work right now though. EOS 1 0 10 yeah, it' s tough.. I don' t know if anyone is hiring. because of the timing like you mentioned. I' ve looked a little bit though. EOS 1 1 11 [Others] I really can' t wait for this year to be over! It' s been so awful. Do you suppose anyone at all has had a good year?
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 0 0 2 Just feeling sad. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad? EOS 0 0 4 Not being able to leave the house with Covid. plus my hours were cut at work. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut. What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 2 Feeling depressed as usual. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 4 Everything. Life. It' s awful. How many years do you really need to stop enjoying this place. Ya know what I mean. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand, but just to make sure I know what is going on fully, you are depressed in general and don' t know how to get through it.. EOS 3 0 6 I would say that is fairly accurate. Often times, I wish an asteroid would come down and begin the apocolypse.. Something to break up the routine. Don' t you find life utterly boring and repetitive?. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Just from these few messages, I can tell you are extremely upset about this.. I have had problems in the past with depression as well, I used to have severe anxiety as well.. EOS 3 0 8 Sorry to hear that. Anxiety and depression are dual bladed sword of badness. Really bad mixture. I never struggled too much with anxiety.. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It was tough. Have you thought about consulting a psychological professional to help with this issue? I did when I was going through my depression and it really helped.. EOS 3 0 10 NO! I would never do that. I' m already on anti depressants. That didn' t help at all.. I just don' t understand why people like life enough to make more people! It is madness! EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I didn' t like the meds that they gave me either, however I felt that talking to someone helped me a great deal.. EOS 3 0 12 Well, I' m glad it helped you. I' m not just saying that. Being depressed is awful.. What did it do for you? How so? EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] It was good to be able to talk to an objective third party about what was going on. It allowed me to get my feelings out without the threat of being judges or harrassed.. EOS 3 0 14 I understand. Well, I appreciate your time and advice. I just don' t feel like you and I are understanding each other very well, though. Anyway, you made your bonus. I appreciate you trying to help me, though. We got to talk for another 4 minutes though. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to focus on more of your hobbies in order to get your mind off of things? EOS 3 0 16 I used to have more hobbies. Now, I' m not so motivated to do much of anything anymore. I used to play instruments. I like hiking a little, but it is winter now. So... I can' t even do that. Plus... I have to travel really far to do that because there is nothing to hike that is very close. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Why did you stop playing insturments? EOS 3 0 18 I just lost interest. I' m losing interest in everything, man. I think it' s time for my heart to give out and make space for the new, ya know. Cross my fingers at least. Dying in your sleep would be best. Wouldn' t that be nice? You just drift off after your heart stops in a dream? EOS 3 1 19 [Others] I certainly hope you don' t do that! EOS 3 0 20 Well, that' s nice. You are a nice person.. Anyway, You finally earned your 3 dollars and 50 cents. You tried. I appreciate it.. Goodbye fellow mturker slave. EOS 3 1 21 [Others] I apologize that I wasn' t able to make you feel any better.
5 0 0 im depressed and angry. EOS 5 1 1 [Question] why would you say that? EOS 5 0 2 i really want a drink. EOS 5 1 3 [Question] is there anything I can help you with? EOS 5 0 4 i' m an alcoholic. EOS 5 1 5 [Question] do you think a drink will help you? EOS 5 0 6 Just had a stressful day. depressed because if i go get a beer i wont stop. no i guess it wouldnt. it still sucks. i want to be normal lol. i get that thought in my head and its like i become obsessed. EOS 5 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] why not try to put attention in some other things instead of a beer. EOS 5 0 8 hmmm like what? EOS 5 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] its only in your mind. EOS 5 0 10 i hate my mind. EOS 5 1 11 [Question] like working out? it will give you a lot of benefits especially with your health. you can do it! EOS 5 0 12 i actually was thinking of starting again. i did about 15 min this morning. i used to workout like 2 hours a day lol. thank you. EOS 5 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] oh that' s nice. youre welcome! EOS 5 0 14 i actually just switched from beachbody to les mills. i got bored with beachb body workouts lol. having something different is nice. EOS 5 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] of course you can try different things. EOS 5 0 16 i got on a sweet tooth. which i' m mad at myself for lol. i sued to never eat candy and junk food. the past few weeks... ugh. EOS 5 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] just do it with moderation, don' t be mad at youself. EOS 5 0 18 ive always been really hard on myself, i dont know why. EOS 5 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] we all want to eat sweets.
4 0 0 I' m feeling really sad, I thought it was going somewhere. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What do you mean you thought it was going somewhere? Are you okay? EOS 4 0 2 yes I' m okay, I' m so sad. five years, I gave my heart to this girl. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Did you guys break up recently? EOS 4 0 4 yes she broke my heart last night, what did I do wrong? EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong. You shouldn' t blame yourself. EOS 4 0 6 but I gave her my all. I feel so betrayed. I' m feeling so sad I want to jump over a bridge. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there, a few years before I was married, my boyfriend broke up with me. We had some space, and then were able to become friends again. And you know what? We ended up getting back together and getting married. EOS 4 0 8 you think it' s my fault? 5 years man, 5 years and just like that she broke my heart. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t give up, you never know what the future holds. I don' t know your particular situation, but it takes two to make relationships work. I don' t think you should blame yourself. EOS 4 0 10 thank you, will try to keep my head up. you think she cheated on me? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] I don' t know what happened. Is that what you think happened? EOS 4 0 12 well I don' t know. why end so abruptly. EOS 4 1 13 [Question] What did she say when you broke up? EOS 4 0 14 she just said it' s over! over the damn phone. EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Yikes! I' m sure that didn' t feel very good.
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state. EOS 0 0 6 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well. EOS 0 0 8 Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing( which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all. I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out. EOS 0 0 10 What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job: it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. Working there would be ministry, not typical work. And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, that' s a big deal. i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it. EOS 0 0 12 Thank you. I believe there are three things in my favor: I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current( related) job fifteen years ago. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] even by working there, you will surely meet new friends. do you know many people from the church? EOS 0 0 14 We worked together for almost 13 years before she retired, but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer/ work partner? I know a few of the higher ups from the area churches, and a handful of families. I know half the core staff I would be working with daily and think of them as extended family.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you just have to be patient and don' t push it too hard so that you won' t look desperate. EOS 0 0 16 The benefits are nice, also, such as staff are provided meals prepared by the banquet chef and his team when at work. And though everyone has a role, the office staff support each other well and work as a team. EOS 0 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, banquet at work. that is a wonderland stuff. EOS 0 0 18 At the risk of preaching religion, I believe God may be calling me to serve there.. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is definitely a dream job. God is everywhere. just put your trust in Him. He never sleep nor slumber. EOS 0 0 20 When off duty, staff are encouraged to enjoy the facilities and mingle with guests. There is an Olympic sized pool, field games, a gymnasium, an exercise room, and if off duty, one can attend most any of the events on the campus, unless designated as a private event. EOS 0 1 21 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow! Olympic size pool. Keep praying. the job is yours. EOS 0 0 22 Because my job is to sell repeat business, it is essential that I get out and meet guests and make certain that their needs are met, but it usually comes in the form of serving snacks at intermission and saying hellos as one passes. It would feel like a family reunion, but in a family where everyone gets along. EOS 0 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] that is good, i work in such place where everyone is like a family. EOS 0 0 24 The music events year round are outstanding. They have many well known names in Christian music as well as speakers who are well worth hearing. To be able to hear these messages at no cost makes the job priceless. EOS 0 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i can feel your excitement. EOS 0 0 26 As I said to my pastor, just to work somewhere where people say thank you and ask how you are doing rather than criticize every move would be such a blessing. And since I work nights already, I am more than happy to cover the office overnight to attend to guests who have locked themselves out, or have other concerns. I used to live on site at the motel where I work now, and on my days off, all I did was make keys and walk the grounds to ensure safety. At this facility, there are beautiful benches to sit and watch the moon and stars and enjoy the sunrise or just take a moment. There are covered gazebos and a couple buildings have deep covered porches for days when it' s a bit rainy or the sun is strong. And we' re across the street from mountains and a river. The campus is simply beautiful. EOS 0 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] we are trying to make impact and survive which is what you have been doing with your current work. but sooner or later you will get your real job. EOS 0 0 28 I pray you are right. I feel as though I have been running on a hamster wheel, but it has brought me to this. Fifteen years of directly related experience, with about another 15 to 20 years of customer service, call center, and customer facing work. EOS 0 1 29 [Reflection of feelings] I hope and pray everything happens the way you wished. you have been working hard. I will put you in my prayers.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there how can be of help? EOS 3 0 2 I am suffering from low mood and general depression. I don' t know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down( obviously) and there doesn' t appear to be any real reason behind it. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue? EOS 3 0 4 I felt this way for a while actually isn' t a recent change it' s been building slowly over time. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same? EOS 3 0 6 I think I know what you mean. It' s getting worse. I feel very down. EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse. EOS 3 0 8 Yeah. I worry that I' ll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. I' m really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Firstly, you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with depression and it' s good that you have reached out for help for this. EOS 3 0 10 Any suggestions on what to do about it? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many reasons people have depression. It is a recognised medical condition and the good news is that there is help out there. The first step is recognising the problem. EOS 3 0 12 Ok well there is definitely a problem. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Have you spoken to friends and family about this? do they know how much you are struggling with it at the moment? EOS 3 0 14 not really I don' t want to bother other people with my problems. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. I think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help. EOS 3 0 16 Yeah maybe. I suppose nobody really understands but I could at least speak to them about it. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] everyone has problems and it is good to talk about them because a problem shared is a problem halved. It doesn' t mean the problems will go away but it might help you understand them and then be able to deal with them better. EOS 3 0 18 I don' t want to feel like this anymore. I' m willing to at least give it a go. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also think that it will be worse to get in touch with your doctor or a medical professional. these people are trained to deal with problems like yours and will be able to offer effective Solutions from a medical perspective. EOS 3 0 20 I haven' t spoken to a doctor about this before to be clear I don' t want any medication. EOS 3 1 21 [Question] are you worried that speaking to a doctor will lead to you being given medication, and you don' t want this? EOS 3 0 22 yes that' s right I don' t want to take any pills or anything like that. EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know that some forms of depression are caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain and medication in these cases can help. Also psychologists can support with mental health which means that this would not be a rude day involves any medication at all potentially. EOS 3 0 24 what do you mean be a rude day. EOS 3 1 25 [Others] apologies this was a typo by autocorrect. I meant to say that this would not be a route that involves any medication at all potentially. EOS 3 0 26 ok thanks for explaining. I think I' ll speak to my sister about this. if this doesn' t help I' ll look into making an appointment with the psychologist maybe.. EOS 3 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s great. I think the first step is always the hardest but you come across as someone that is willing to seek help and I believe that if you face into this you can overcome it witht he right support. EOS 3 0 28 Thanks for that. EOS 3 1 29 [Greeting] You' re welcome.

EOS 0 0 3 im feeling very overwhelmed and cant get anything done cause i dont know where to start! i want to declutter my house but dont know where to start. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I hear you, feeling overwhelmed and like you don' t know where to start can leave a person feeling stressd forsure! Decluttering sounds like a great idea! Sometimes taking baby steps is a good place to start! EOS 0 0 5 but there are so many thinggs to do and ideas i have. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Of course! It can feel so stressful when we have all these little things we want to do but don' t know where to start! EOS 0 0 7 should i start in one room or one group of things and collect them from all the rooms? EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What is one little area that maybe seems easier to start with? Yeah, that' s a great idea! EOS 0 0 9 well i seem to start and them i end up jumoing to another thing! jumping. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, well that' s okay! starting is half the battle, so that' s an accomplishment right there!
5 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling today? EOS 5 0 1 uninspired. broken. a rock. a static object. bananas. EOS 5 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, that' s a start. Do I hear you saying that you' re confused at the moment? EOS 5 0 3 not confused. frustrated that I have to produce art for marks when I am not inspired. EOS 5 1 4 [Question] Ah I hear you, education can be both wonderful and difficult can' t it? What are you supposed to produce? EOS 5 0 5 painting after painting. like I am an ikea machine, photocopying picasos for A' s. EOS 5 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that that is very frustrating. Would you consider switching majors? EOS 5 0 7 What is life but a stage. Art is life. I love art.. no. EOS 5 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass. Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of your future and one day it will pay off? EOS 5 0 9 does the sun now set and then rise again. Does the spring not come after winter. Yet I cannot see how art will give me grades. EOS 5 1 10 [Question] Well, I am assuming that you want to go into an artistic field on graduation? EOS 5 0 11 yes, but no like a 9 - 5 job. perhaps i am yet another art failure. art has no time. EOS 5 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you are putting yourself down unnecessarily. Many people do make a lucrative career from an art qualification. I would urge you to keep working to the best of your ability and see what happens. EOS 5 0 13 you speak the truth. I will again pick up my brush and see where my inspiration takes me. oh it has been a joy talking to you. EOS 5 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you ever tried searching for information about careers in your field? We still have a few minutes left:) There are a lot of different ways in which you can use an art degree! EOS 5 0 15 Yes. we do. I will call my newest work the brilliant support of mturk! pls give me more inspriation. EOS 5 1 16 [Others] That sounds like a definite winner:) I see a Turner prize beckoning in your future. EOS 5 0 17 wow. Turner. are you in the UK? is the UK. EOS 5 1 18 [Others] Yes I am, where are you?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello there! How can I help you this afternoon?. EOS 3 0 1 I' m just feeling really down lately and would like to talk to someone who understands. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Feeling consistently sad is a tough place to be. I' m sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 3 0 3 Thank you. I think since the pandemic it' s gotten worse. It' s hard to find the" reason" to go about my day. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand that. Are you working or attending classes from home?. EOS 3 0 5 I graduated in the spring but haven' t been able to find a job because of what' s going on, so that' s been tough. My wife works from home though. What about you? EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It' s very hard to maintain a sense of consistency when we have few boundaries on our time, or a daily routine.. EOS 3 0 7 Very true! I try to keep a routine with exercise and cooking, things like that. Going outside for walks... EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I have been attending school online, and I occasionally make deliveries for my husband and I' s small business.. EOS 3 0 9 Oh that' s great! EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, a daily routine is good for normalizing change. It' s also good for structuring in time to relax and recharge, which you still need even if you aren' t currently employed. Times are still very stressful and uncertain, and that takes an emotional toll no matter who you are..
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work. EOS 4 0 14 Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn' t even want me to help her, no she doesn' t work. EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family. EOS 4 0 16 Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] How long has it been since she moved in.
1 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How may I help you today? EOS 1 0 1 hi. I am stressed with my 25 year old moved back from NYC.. My boyfriend and I have a home and my son does not like him. EOS 1 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that i can understand how you must be feeling. Why does your son not like your boyfriend? EOS 1 0 3 He is going back to school and I am supporting him in that. The problem is that my boyfriend thinks my son should speak to me more respectfully. He gets upset when my son is swears and shows anger to me. EOS 1 1 4 [Question] Have you talked to your boyfriend about how you are feeling? EOS 1 0 5 He knows that I am torn. I am not going to put my son out of the house. I am also not one to get loud and angry. My son verbally is aggressive. EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand why your boyfriend be getting upset if your son is disrespectful to you and is aggressive but you know that is your son and you going to be there for him no matter what. EOS 1 0 7 Yes, and I have gotten my son to go to a therapist weekly to try to express his anger about the pandemic and the changes it has brought in his lifestyle. He cannot take his frustrustations out on us. EOS 1 1 8 [Question] How long has this been going on? Is the therapist working for him? EOS 1 0 9 He came back last March for what we thought at the time would be a month or two. EOS 1 1 10 [Question] Have you had a conversation with your son about the way he is acting? EOS 1 0 11 He is difficult to get through to. He seems to have traded midwestern charm for NYC bullying. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe he should start seeing a therapist every day maybe that will help. EOS 1 0 13 I am not sure that he can afford that, but I have seen small changes in his behavior since he started seeing her. I want him to stop seeing my boyfriend as the enemy. EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe your boyfriend and your son needs to sit down and have a talk. EOS 1 0 15 That may work with a therapist. I have tried to mediate and both were terribly bull headed and argumentative. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] or you know your boyfriend can plan out a day or something and your son and your boyfriend can go out and do something fun. EOS 1 0 17 I am a quiet person and I want a happy household.. EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] They should have a talk because communication is key and that will solve a lot. EOS 1 0 19 Thank you. You are right. I just want to get rid of the tension in the house. EOS 1 1 20 [Others] I am sure he will stop the way he is acting it just may take some time.
0 0 0 Hello? Is anyone there? Is anyone there. HELLO? no one is supporting me here..:: twiddles thumbs:: the instructions for the support seeker are incorrect as there is no button that has shown for" the partner' s reasons".. the supporter did not respond. This test is skewed. No one is here to chat with. even after being matched. Ridiculous. hello????? hello? no other messages except my own are showing up. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Sorry, I had a bad connection. Hello, what can I help you with? EOS 0 0 2 Hi. i wasn' t sure anyone was there. i left my job about three months after 8 years.. haven' t found another one.. trying to find one has been challenging. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Just be clear, you' re worried about finding a new job? EOS 0 0 4 well, yeah. in the middle of a pandemic, and being in a new town. all of that has been really hard. and stressful. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a difficult position to be in. It is a hard time, but there' s always a way to persevere. EOS 0 0 6 yeah... i don' t know... i' m not sleeping well because i' m so worried. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I could imagine that being a constant worry. I understand how you may feel. EOS 0 0 8 thanks for trying to understand. it just seems pretty hopeless. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] No problem. I am encountering a similar situation, looking for a well suited job. Have you tried looking in to new career fields that have always interested you? EOS 0 0 10 Yeah, I am looking in a variety of fields. not much out there that is remote. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are a lot of jobs in technology where the only requirement is learning a few courses, such as programming. EOS 0 0 12 that would be cool. i really enjoy tech. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It would be nice to work in a field that you also enjoy! EOS 0 0 14 yes it would.. just don' t have much energy to keep turning in cover letters and resumes.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It can seem hopeless right now, but think about how you felt when you were in a better position. EOS 0 0 16 yah thats true. you have any ideas on how to be less anxious. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] That helps me balance things out in my head sometimes. Sometimes we get stuck. It happens. EOS 0 0 18 yeah, stuck is a good description. EOS 0 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Accept that you are anxious so you can control it instead of it control you. Accepting actually makes you less focused on it, because you don' t have to wonder about it. I hope that helps and good luck!
5 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 5 0 1 am fine thank you. EOS 5 1 2 [Question] Is there anything that you would like to talk about? EOS 5 0 3 no, now am okay. EOS 5 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well I am happy to listen to any problems that you have. EOS 5 0 5 problem with cowoorkers but i solved. EOS 5 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, can you tell me about it anyway? I am happy to listen. Do feel free to talk:) EOS 5 0 7 we had agree with them work to do and date to submit it to me, but unfortunately their fail to do so. EOS 5 1 8 [Question] Are you still working at that place?

Bearing in mind that you are not going to be paid for this HIT unless you actually make an effort. EOS 5 0 11 NO AM DONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN. EOS 5 1 12 [Others] I think you have not put any real effort into completing this HIT. EOS 5 0 13 WHY, AM SORRRY FOR THAT. EOS 5 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] please press quit now. Press the quit button or you will not get paid. I s till will. EOS 5 0 15 HELLOW AM READY TO GO ON WITH OUR CONSERVATION. SOORRY FO THE FAIL. EOS 5 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The conversation is over - it needed to only be15 minutes. Please press the quit button. If you do not, I will my end but then neither of us gets paid anything.
0 0 0 hey. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m good, busy. I need another job to pay more bills. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having a difficult time with your finances. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 yes somewhat. i can pay it off within 2 - 3 years without a second job. id like to pay it off faster though. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure it will take dedication and hard work, but I bet you can do it! EOS 0 0 6 I think so. Im doing mturk for a second job right now. it helps some. i don' t know about getting another job. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been in your shoes and also feel that' s a good way to add a little extra income. It can really add up if left to built and used towards a specific goal. EOS 0 0 8 I agree 100%. Been spending it on new clothes and toiletries lately to stock up for the covid shutdown. the extra money helps alot. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It definitely can help. Perhaps you could have a separate way of using some of the money to go towards some of the other bills you would like to pay off? Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns. EOS 0 0 10 i currently do that. it' s hard to have the patience to pay it off. i hate having debt hanging over my head. i like to have nice things though and they cost money. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Yes, and I have found this can be a good way to provide for the extra luxuries we like, without taking away from money that' s used towards household bills. EOS 0 0 12 absolutely. i make sure all of my household bills are paid every month. i think it will get better once these debts are paid off. i needed a lot of new things at once since the old had worn out. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to use some of the scripts that can be added that allows you to catch hits that are hard to get on Mturk? They can be very helpful. Also, there are forums that have all kinds of useful information for workers. EOS 0 0 14 no i haven' t tried those yet. do i have to pay for those scripts? EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You might find it useful to do a little research and add them as extensions to Chrome or whatever browser you use. They are free and pretty simple to use. EOS 0 0 16 So I could make more money on mturk than I am now by using those? EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] They have helped me in being able to get a bit more extra income. The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It' s easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over. The forums can a large amount of help too. Perhaps try MTS. They also can show exactly how much you end up making per hour, filter by monetary amount of hits, etc. EOS 0 0 18 oh wow, thank ya! I' ll look into that. MTS is a script? Which script should I use? EOS 0 1 19 [Greeting] Of course, I hope it can be of use too you! One I use is Mechanical Turk Suite, which is an extension. I think you can look up as a search for extensions, scripts etc. Or Mturk forums and find out tons of help! EOS 0 0 20 Thank ya! I' ll check it out. EOS 0 1 21 [Greeting] You' re welcome! Best of Luck! EOS 0 0 22 Thank ya! Have a good night. Bye. EOS 0 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] I think you have it. You too.
5 0 0 im depressed and angry. EOS 5 1 1 [Question] why would you say that? EOS 5 0 2 i really want a drink. EOS 5 1 3 [Question] is there anything I can help you with? EOS 5 0 4 i' m an alcoholic. EOS 5 1 5 [Question] do you think a drink will help you? EOS 5 0 6 Just had a stressful day. depressed because if i go get a beer i wont stop. no i guess it wouldnt. it still sucks. i want to be normal lol. i get that thought in my head and its like i become obsessed. EOS 5 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] why not try to put attention in some other things instead of a beer.
0 0 0 hello? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 stressed. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It is a stressful time, why are you feeling stressed?
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic? EOS 0 0 16 so literally, I only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. I only started a new work in September, and it' s not much( about two days a week), so I can' t comment too much about that. It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps. EOS 0 0 18 so I get nervous in general when I am at work but I do my work just the same. May not be able to work as well because I have to breathe through a mask, and some other small difficulties. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is good that you can continue to do your work the same. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you for all the positive messages so far and in understanding and sympathizing with me.. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] Is there anything else I should know about how the pandemic is affecting you? EOS 0 0 22 pretty much. If anything, it' s my academic life at home that has changed not so well.. EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Are you a student? EOS 0 0 24 yes, I take online courses and I tend to procrastinate a lot more and get distracted as I find myself more and more at home. Just getting carried away and now have impending deadlines.. I can get through it but it has had a toll on my productivity.. I was just taking my sweet time with it and that wasn' t good. EOS 0 1 25 [Self-disclosure] I am also a student and am not motivated to do school work at home, so I completely understand. I am sure you are successful at school! Having a planner may keep you organized and on - task. Dedicating a certain time frame and area for school work might help, as well.. EOS 0 0 26 Because prior to the pandemic, I was pretty regimented with set schedules and can clear my mind with work - outs and going to the gym and movies, but now it' s not that simple.. EOS 0 1 27 [Question] Is there anything else I can help you with? EOS 0 0 28 Thank you and I hope your schooling goes well also.. EOS 0 1 29 [Greeting] Thank you, you too! EOS 0 0 30 yeah I like your idea of dedicating the time. I find that I am slacking off and being disorganized in areas like time management. So yes I have to improve on that.. I suppose you have been doing your schooling relatively better in your situation?. I hope you do anyhow. EOS 0 1 31 [Question] Great ideas! Is there anything else I can help you with? EOS 0 0 32 would you have any other advice on how to overcome things like time management with academics? like how to avoid procrastination? Because this was so much better in the past that I just had set schedules and can clear my mind by going out, etc.. and feeling refreshed and feeling the urgency to study again.. But that' s gone for me now.. EOS 0 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would reccomend setting deadlines in your planner of when tasks need to be completed and also setting timers for 20 minutes at a time where you have to focus for that long before you can do any other task. EOS 0 0 34 Great, I think that' s a good area for me to go into.. Timers and set agendas. EOS 0 1 35 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes!
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? I' d love to chat with you! What' s been on your mind? EOS 3 0 1 oh hello. I' m having problems with friends - or more precisely the lack of them. I don' t have any. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see. You feel as though you don' t have any friend' s currently? I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It' s so hard to see people and keep relationships right now. EOS 3 0 3 Well it' s more that I think I' ve never had friends. Not anyone I can confide in or laugh with. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a really hard thing to be going through. I' m sorry to hear that. Do you have any really close family members that you are able to confide in? EOS 3 0 5 I don' t think I' d want to let them know how unhappy I am to be honest. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Oh I see. Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn' t have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out! IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it' s 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do. I actually found a couple close friends through apps like that. Have you heard about those or looked into them? EOS 3 0 7 I' ve never heard of friendship apps to be honest. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah! They are a really good way to connect with people that you share a lot of similar interests with.. But it sounds to me that you are pretty overall sad right now. You don' t want family to know about how sad you are. Do you think it' s more than just feeling like you don' t have any friends? EOS 3 0 9 I' d really like someone local though, someone who I could meet up with face to face and who knew my town. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] On most of the apps, it connects you with people in your town! people close by. EOS 3 0 11 I don' t know if it' s more than that. What do you mean? The problem is that I lack the courage to go out and meet people. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Well personally, I have struggled with putting myself down a lot and blaming myself for things that I shouldn' t blame myself for. You shouldn' t blame yourself for not having the courage to go meet people, or blame yourself for not having any friends! And if that is what you are struggling with, then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you! You can create those bonds and connections with people close by to you on there first, and then when you feel comfortable enough with them you can meet up. That way it' s less awkward to hangout with someone you don' t really know. EOS 3 0 13 oh you mean chat online first, before actually meeting in person? EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, that is what is great about those friendship apps. You can get comfortable with them before you hangout:) EOS 3 0 15 That' s so cool. Thanks for your help. EOS 3 1 16 [Greeting] Yeah of course! I hope this helps you, and I wish you the best during these weird times:)
3 0 0 hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hey. How are you? EOS 3 0 2 i am not feeling too great. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why not? EOS 3 0 4 i am not able to find a job for over 5 years. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] How have you been able to get by? EOS 3 0 6 i am on social assiatnce but its not enough and i feel so worthless. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If you keep trying things will work out in the end. EOS 3 0 8 but i have been tryin for so long, i dont know what ti do. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Perhaps you havent searched well enough, have you gone to many interviews? EOS 3 0 10 yes I did do a lot of interveiws but no one hired me. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps on the interviews you are doing something wrong, because it have been a while.
4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 4 1 2 [Greeting] I am good how are you. EOS 4 0 3 I am glad you are doing well, I have been struggling lately as my girlfriend that I was going to propose to broke up with me. She told me that my career path was different then hers and she just did not see it working out. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] How was your career path different? I understand how you are feeling everything will be okay. EOS 4 0 5 She had a desire to do marine biology and I wanted to pursue law enforcement as a police officer, however due to my back injury that fell through recently. She would spend most of her time doing field work, which would require her to spend time out at sea. She was working in a nursing home at the time and was not a marine biologist.. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] She did not like your career path?
6 0 0 Hi. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. how are you? how may i help you today? EOS 6 0 2 Kinda sad today. Wanted to ask for some mental support. EOS 6 1 3 [Question] what is making you sad? EOS 6 0 4 Not being able to find a job after graduation. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand how you are feeling i had the same problem after i graduated. EOS 6 0 6 okay. EOS 6 1 7 [Question] have you put in job applications everywhere. EOS 6 0 8 Yes I did, and quite a lot but I think because of the pandemic they are not hiring that much. EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] With this pandemic going on i know it is even more harder to get a job. EOS 6 0 10 yes. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you are right. Have you looked on the internet such as indeed? EOS 6 0 12 I' ve tried LinkedIn they have many companies hiring. maybe my CV is just bad. EOS 6 1 13 [Question] yes they do i am familiar with that. how is your resume looking?
2 0 0 hi. EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hey! How are you? EOS 2 0 2 trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once:( EOS 2 1 3 [Question] What are these thoughts?:) EOS 2 0 4 Its so stupid. I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts just come so fast. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello, I am looking for help in managing some depression. EOS 3 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You' ve come to a good place to start. Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 3 I am feeling resentful towards my husband for quitting his job, and my son for being the reason that he quit his job.. My son' s behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us. EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband' s loss of work and your son' s loss of his job is entirely understandable. EOS 3 0 5 I have a hard time not dwelling on the negative things going on. It' s hard to see anything positive or feel hopeful for the future. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and I understand the added stress that can cause in your household. That is a really difficult position to be in.
4 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 4 0 2 I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age? EOS 4 0 4 He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough, both for you and him. I know it' s meaningless to tell you not to be sad, however, you can think that he' s not in a better place. EOS 4 0 6 I presume you mean now and not not;). Though I simply am not a believer. It just made me think how meaningless life was.. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn' t it? I sometimes think it' s meaningless too. EOS 4 0 8 I do not really know what to do about my feelings. They are not going away. EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I feel you, coping with losing your loved ones is never easy. In fact, it' s confusing when you grieve and even when you recover and move on.
2 0 0 hi. EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hey! How are you? EOS 2 0 2 trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once:( EOS 2 1 3 [Question] What are these thoughts?:) EOS 2 0 4 Its so stupid. I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts just come so fast. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while. EOS 2 0 6 tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes I cant controll the thoughts or like I dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing. EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] A chemical thing, so maybe you need a counsellor, and then he can assess your problem, and everything will be alright:) EOS 2 0 8 I have one and it helps sometimes. I try to meditate. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. Does it help you? If it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently. EOS 2 0 10 i pretty much have to do it constantly. EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not constantly. because then you won' t have anytime to do anything else, but if negative thoughts always come into your head, maybe try doing something you enjoy doing. EOS 2 0 12 yeah maybe its as simple as that. I know Im the problem cause its very obvious that im the on ein control of the thoughts for the most part. EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, maybe. But always look at the bright side of stuff and maybe the negative thoughts can stop. EOS 2 0 14 right. I will try and start that more today and commit to it. EOS 2 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes that' s the spirit! And with that mind set good things will always come to you!
3 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you. EOS 3 0 1 Not doing well. I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Oh no, how long had you been together? EOS 3 0 3 we were together for 2 years. It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Wow, that' s horrible. How do you feel about it? EOS 3 0 5 I feel lost. I' m so used to her being around everyday. Now I don' t know what to do with myself without her. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year. EOS 3 0 7 Not only that, but with Covid going on I have noone i can see to talk about it. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have any family? EOS 3 0 9 Yes, i do, but they are far away. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Friends closeby? Hobbies? What kind of work do you do? EOS 3 0 11 I do have friends, who are also friends with her. However they have families and do not visit prople because of covid. I don' t have any true hobbies. I don' t think they will fill the void anyways. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow. EOS 3 0 13 I do software development, but its a work at home situation. So i have been just by myself for the last week, and its driving me crazy. All i do is think about why she would do that. I' ve had time to myself but its not getting any better. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have always tried to think of things in a positive way. This way even when something really bad happens, it doesn' t seem so bad as to overwhelm us from recovering. EOS 3 0 15 What positive are there here? EOS 3 1 16 [Question] I' m actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it? Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren' t hurting for money. EOS 3 0 17 It' s ok. pays the bills. But my job is pretty independent. so i don' t even get to meet new people. I am usually home, while she was always out of the house during the day. EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can use that stress that has been building up to find a new outlet for the stress.

EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out. EOS 4 0 6 I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night? EOS 4 0 8 I can' t sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it' s typically late afternoon. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds like you are doing the very best you can under difficult circumstances. you should feel very proud about that. EOS 4 0 10 thank you. i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] it sounds to me that your sleep issue is really weighing on your mind. you may be setting yourself up for sleep issues by thinking about this so much. is that possible? EOS 4 0 12 yes it may be. i' m not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking.

EOS 4 0 18 maybe overwatch. i haven' t been playing them much. EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] i' m wondering: are you a reader? do you enjoy reading? i' m asking because i find when i read a good book, time seems to move very quickly. EOS 4 0 20 i am. but i have a hard time focusing as of late. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can make a goal of reading a few pages and then see if you can build on that. then, if you want, you can make a goal of reading a chapter. EOS 4 0 22 that' s a great idea. that may help a lot with focus. EOS 4 1 23 [Self-disclosure] personally i love reading; especially non fiction. what type of books do you enjoy? EOS 4 0 24 dystopian fantasy style books. and also historical nonfiction. EOS 4 1 25 [Self-disclosure] i enjoy historical non fiction very much. do you have any favorite authors?

0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic? EOS 0 0 16 so literally, I only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. I only started a new work in September, and it' s not much( about two days a week), so I can' t comment too much about that. It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps. EOS 0 0 18 so I get nervous in general when I am at work but I do my work just the same. May not be able to work as well because I have to breathe through a mask, and some other small difficulties. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is good that you can continue to do your work the same. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you for all the positive messages so far and in understanding and sympathizing with me.. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] Is there anything else I should know about how the pandemic is affecting you? EOS 0 0 22 pretty much. If anything, it' s my academic life at home that has changed not so well.. EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Are you a student? EOS 0 0 24 yes, I take online courses and I tend to procrastinate a lot more and get distracted as I find myself more and more at home. Just getting carried away and now have impending deadlines.. I can get through it but it has had a toll on my productivity.. I was just taking my sweet time with it and that wasn' t good. EOS 0 1 25 [Self-disclosure] I am also a student and am not motivated to do school work at home, so I completely understand. I am sure you are successful at school! Having a planner may keep you organized and on - task. Dedicating a certain time frame and area for school work might help, as well.. EOS 0 0 26 Because prior to the pandemic, I was pretty regimented with set schedules and can clear my mind with work - outs and going to the gym and movies, but now it' s not that simple.. EOS 0 1 27 [Question] Is there anything else I can help you with? EOS 0 0 28 Thank you and I hope your schooling goes well also.. EOS 0 1 29 [Greeting] Thank you, you too! EOS 0 0 30 yeah I like your idea of dedicating the time. I find that I am slacking off and being disorganized in areas like time management. So yes I have to improve on that.. I suppose you have been doing your schooling relatively better in your situation?. I hope you do anyhow. EOS 0 1 31 [Question] Great ideas! Is there anything else I can help you with? EOS 0 0 32 would you have any other advice on how to overcome things like time management with academics? like how to avoid procrastination? Because this was so much better in the past that I just had set schedules and can clear my mind by going out, etc.. and feeling refreshed and feeling the urgency to study again.. But that' s gone for me now.. EOS 0 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would reccomend setting deadlines in your planner of when tasks need to be completed and also setting timers for 20 minutes at a time where you have to focus for that long before you can do any other task. EOS 0 0 34 Great, I think that' s a good area for me to go into.. Timers and set agendas. EOS 0 1 35 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes! EOS 0 0 36 like a timetable when they used to hand out when I used to be in high school, let' s say. and this hour I do this, etc.. and as you say, yoga or work out in between. all great ideas I think. EOS 0 1 37 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, excellent!

EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is natural to feel sad when someone you care about dies. EOS 4 0 4 IS there something I can do to feel better? EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are you with family? Sometimes it helps to be with others who are grieving? EOS 4 0 6 No, I live alone, my family lives in another state. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being by yourself is rough after a death. Can you talk with your family by phone? Do you have a friend who has gone through a similar loss?
1 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 1 0 1 I am just a little angry. My mother and I had another blow - up. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother? EOS 1 0 3 It is why I am angry. This occurs at least every other day. I say something harmless and she thinks I am saying it in a way that is rude or something. EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you can figure out a way to communicate better. EOS 1 0 5 I do not know for sure where to start. If I try to tell her that is not what I mean it is like she doesn' t understand? EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to feel misunderstood. EOS 1 0 7 For example today I was just saying I like the food she had cooked us for supper. She took that to mean I never liked the food she made before. She says I do not appreciate her and I should be grateful to have her. EOS 1 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing your best to be nice but it isn' t getting through. EOS 1 0 9 Maybe it was the way she was brought up that she is so sensitive. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everybody has stuff from their past that affects them. EOS 1 0 11 But they should not take how they feel on others right? But I know I have to be understanding. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You should be understanding, especially since you already know this. EOS 1 0 13 Can you relate to this situation?

How long were you with your partner? EOS 4 0 5 3years of time we have been in love. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I once had a relationship end after 5 years with a partner. Staying active really helped me get over the relationship. Through that activity I actually met my new partner! EOS 4 0 7 but i love my partner so much that i couldnt forget her right now. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about doing something fun, like taking a trip somewhere? EOS 4 0 9 yeah we went for trip we had a god relationship.

1 0 0 I am so mad that I can' t see straight. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello! What is on your mind today? Oh really? Why is that? EOS 1 0 2 Well, my boyfriend has cheated so many times that I cant count them. I then meet someone nice and cheat on him once and now he breaks up with me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] being mad that your boyfriend cheated is normal. being mad when dumped is normal. don' t you think you DESERVE better than he was treating you? EOS 1 0 4 Thank you! I can see that I am talking to someone who understands. I am wondering if I should beg him back?? I really do love him. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there too. Expecially with covid, it can be hard realiing you may be alone and it may be frusterating dating someone new. if you really love someone, shouldnt they love you back? did his actions show love? EOS 1 0 6 Yeah, and we have been together since high school so it is really hard to think of ever marrying anyone else. He asked me to marry him but we never made it official or got rings. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak. i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart. EOS 1 0 8 He told me he never wants kids with me but acts like he would have them someday, somehow? I think you' re right. EOS 1 1 9 [Self-disclosure] i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter. trust me, its not worth it in the long run. maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you! EOS 1 0 10 Noway! That is my worst nightmare, I am so sorry. That is a real eye opener for me/ That is exactly what I don' t think I could handle. I just am in the worst cycle ever and don' t have any friends to turn to or anybody who wants to listen to the drama. I think I have wasted a lot of my life and I can' t ever get the time back that I have invested in him. EOS 1 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i think a lot of couples are feeling stuck with covid. once things open up and everyone is vaccinated and get togethers happen again, i bet there will be a LOT more breakups and a lot more options out there! all we can do is learn from our mistakes and not let the past repeat itself. EOS 1 0 12 Yeah, I can see your point. It is nice being able to vent to you and feel like I am being heard. I never got that in my relationship with him. I need to learn from the past this time and stop repeating it. EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] with your newly aquired free time, you can focus on you! start a new hobby, dye your hair, do something you always wanted to do!

EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I agree, it is hard to spend time with people at the moment. We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted. It would be good to have something positive to look forward to. EOS 0 0 11 I try the dating sites, but they seem to far away or impersonal. Hope things are better. Just the current season ahs me down.

I am wondering if your friend might be upset and embarrassed that they can not pay you back immediately? Have you asked her if she could even afford some sort of small payments? EOS 1 0 8 Yes, i asked her how we could restructure the payment in her favor because i understand how difficult it is for everyone right now but she did not answer. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Were you speaking on the phone or in person? Is this a financial burden for you? Would you consider this person a good friend? Would you be sad if they were not in your life anymore? EOS 1 0 10 We were speaking on phone because i wanted to set up a physical meeting where we could discuss the logistics.

I was with him since childhood and we are actually still together. I slipped up one night and hate to admit what I did.

I can' t think of anything else. I hate to tell you but I cheated on him. I am so sorry and can' t look at myself in the mirror.

He doesn' t know what I did but he is little suspicious. EOS 6 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You definitely deserve to laugh and be happy. One mistake doesn' t define you! EOS 6 0 8 Thank you! A long time ago his sister told me that he cheated on me and I believed her and so I wanted to get him back. EOS 6 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It says a lot about your character that you feel badly about this, that you can see and recognize you acted in a way you don' t agree with. That' s something to build on. That desire to" get even" is definitely understandable. EOS 6 0 10 I appreciate that and have been thinking about character a lot lately. I do believe he cheated on me first, if that even matters now. EOS 6 1 11 [Question] Do you feel like you got what you needed from the experience, as in, that you' ve" gotten even"? EOS 6 0 12 Yes, I feel very even! I won' t do it again. Can I ever give up the guilt that I feel and move on in our relationship or do I have to tell him what I did? I have known couples who don' t tell each other and they are happy now. EOS 6 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] While it may be true in general that honesty is the best policy, in this case I wouldn' t suggest telling him. It is just going to cause angry feelings. But, the fact you already believed he cheated on you and it motivated you to do the same shows a basic lack of trust in this relationship. That' s something you should really look at.
3 0 0 Hi. I am Mike. Live in central Kansas and have been very depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that, is there a particular reason or instance for you feeling this way? EOS 3 0 2 I lost my job due to Covid and they have shut down for good. no jobs around here and no vehicle so i feel hopeless and hate my living situation. just before covid hit i was saving to move... but then job closed. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes that is a very tough situation, Covid has real placed a large amount of stress through out the world. There may be a ray of hope however with a possible vaccine in the near future, maybe this will be back to normal soon and new jobs will become available. EOS 3 0 4 I hope so and that is what i know mentally. but emotionally it is hard. i just hate having no job, being at home, no money, no vehicle, and a very bad idea to date since there is a high contagious pandemic. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand and you are right it is a a lot of mental stress. Have you reached out to claim unemployment or go to a food pantry? During this pandemic you should not feel shameful to take advantage of these services, there are alot of people who have to ask for help for the first time in their lives. EOS 3 0 6 I did not make enough to get unemployment they said. I have not tried a food pantry but that is a great idea. what makes this difficult is I am in a very small town. like we dont wal marts or McDonalds or anything like that. Whole town closes at 9. the closest actual city is 45 miles away. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well please try the food pantry and see what they have to offer. Is there anyone whom you could ask for a ride in the future when they go to the bigger city? EOS 3 0 8 I will try food pantry. my sister goes to the city once a month, we shop for the month and i stay with my siter. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well its seem that you now have a plan try it out see how it works, hopefully this will get back to normal sooner than later and life may go back to somewhat normal and your stress level and mental exhaustion will also subside. Is there anything else you would like to talk about? EOS 3 0 10 Well I have been wanting a relationship. and i normally dont feel that way at all. and past week i think how much i kind of should have a family as I am 37 but not sure if i truly want that or i just miss human contact as i have only been around family and not gone out at all except to walk and go to store in town, and am confused if it is actully me wanting somone in my life or just a physical thing. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think your exactly right, human contact is now a premium and I' m sure you miss that contact that we were once so use to. Missing the contact makes you realize how much you enjoy the company of others. Take it slow and once the vaccine is out ease your way back into the dating scene and see if a relationship is what you really wanted after all. EOS 3 0 12 yeah i mean emotionally i want to go maybe try a date or two or even just an adult night out but know logically it is a VERY risky idea. And that I need to not do anything like that till next year at the minimum. I do appreciate the advice and ideas. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] Remember that age is only a number and love will no no number, we are hear to listen and support you so if you ever need to talk just know we are a mouse click away. EOS 3 0 14 And appreciate that especially during the current situation. EOS 3 1 15 [Greeting] Your welcome stay strong.
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why? EOS 4 0 8 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID - 19 lockdowns. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] How long have you been working there? EOS 4 0 10 I am very sad about this country and my work situation. For 5 years. I work in accounting. EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID - 19 really has got us all down. EOS 4 0 12 What a great nation we live in..... a future 3rd world one. Yeah, but I was a good accountant. EOS 4 1 13 [Others] WOW, I' m sure that is a big change for you... EOS 4 0 14 Yeah, I have not told my wife about it just yet. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] I agree, this country has got some issues but we can get through them. Uh, oh, how do you think she will react? EOS 4 0 16 Yeah, I am not sure. I better wait to break the news in 2021. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there. EOS 4 0 18 And I am not the only one who is losing my job. Seems that all of accounting is going to be getting the axe. It makes me sad.... EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year. Do you have a resume?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello. How can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 What should I do. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Tell me about the situation that you are facing. EOS 0 0 3 I try to find a job but there is not many. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking? EOS 0 0 5 About 6 months. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that there are a lot of job loss in the Covid time. Is your job seeking related to that? Yeah it must be very difficult. EOS 0 0 7 yes. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and I got an offer in February right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you. I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family. EOS 0 0 9 I don' t know what types of jobs that fit me. yeah, but it is still rough to get by. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] Tell me more about it if you don' t mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking? EOS 0 0 11 I worked in manufacturer. technical skill in trade school but not degree from college. EOS 0 1 12 [Others] I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position? EOS 0 0 13 I will seek for another jobs if possible but I can work on manufacturer company too. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the Covid time? EOS 0 0 15 If I can work remotely I will do it. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have been browsing job boards every now and then. There are consistently some grocery store jobs, or cashier jobs. If you don' t mind the location, I am sure you would be a good fit for these. EOS 0 0 17 The job market is very competitive. I tried but there are no responds after my interview. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I completely understand. I was looking for jobs for almost a year. I have a spreadsheet that keeps track of all the jobs I applied. Maybe only 2 or 3 percent of them replied( with an interview request, etc.) I would suggest trying applying for jobs via Linkedin, or google jobs. You can sort them by posted date. My experience is that the more recent the posting date is, the more likely they will review your application.
4 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 4 0 2 I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age? EOS 4 0 4 He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough, both for you and him. I know it' s meaningless to tell you not to be sad, however, you can think that he' s not in a better place. EOS 4 0 6 I presume you mean now and not not;). Though I simply am not a believer. It just made me think how meaningless life was.. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn' t it? I sometimes think it' s meaningless too. EOS 4 0 8 I do not really know what to do about my feelings. They are not going away. EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I feel you, coping with losing your loved ones is never easy. In fact, it' s confusing when you grieve and even when you recover and move on. EOS 4 0 10 Do you think that people ever really recover from a significant bereavement? I think that what you said there was very wise. Maybe it' s worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened.. there is guilt that comes with that. EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t think people can completely get over that, you just get used to the pain of not having them around. EOS 4 0 12 Whilst it hurts to think about him being dead, I think that it would hurt more if I had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I just need you to know that whatever your feeling is, it' s completely normal and you shouldn' t feel guilty for having it. EOS 4 0 14 It is just - very hard. I keep thinking about all the times I disagreed with him or did not appreciate him enough and I never got to tell him how much I loved him. EOS 4 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Your dad wouldn' t want to see you grieving everyday either. You should live the way you know he' d love to see. I believe he knew you loved him regardless how much you two argued.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 I am well, thanks for asking. I am doing some studying and taking a break now. Just to talk about some of the feelings, thoughts, and stresses. The big thing on my mind now is the pandemic. And it' s the start of the second wave in my city.. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand what you are going though, indeed it is tough times. EOS 3 0 4 yeah it sure has been since March this year for my city. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So tell me, what are you going through your mind regarding the pandemic and the second wave? EOS 3 0 6 There' s kind of a lag as I am on the East Coast. So the cases didn' t really show up for the second wave until this month, only sporadically last month. But we were doing now until about two to three weeks ago. well fear, anxiety. worries, and also anger that people are being foolish and complacent, especially the youth groups that go to gyms and restaurants a lot, or to gatherings. even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, I don' t know and it just boggles on my mind.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I understand, I' m from the east coast and I' m deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown. EOS 3 0 8 I get that there' s a fatigue but I was there and I had that fatigue and I got over that a few months ago late summer when I tried to reason myself that it was safe to go out when there weren' t any cases then, as the first w ave was gone from my city. I see. Yeah I feel you definitely. like people are becoming impatient but this is not the right time to be. If I can overcome that initial impatience, others should also. If they have no right reason to be out except for work and personal business, then I don' t think they should be doing that too much.. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I think those who are aware of the situation should follow the rules and be aware. We really can' t change the situation because it human nature. EOS 3 0 10 it is. And that' s sad but true. It' s in our nature, as you say. It' s in our nature to destroy and to consume, etc. unfortunate but I can only cope by doing what I feel is right, and continue to do so. and not compromise my values along with others. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] However, we shouldn' t let it affect us physically, spiritually and most importantly mentally. We need stay relax and be aware of whats going on and believe that by following the rules we are doing our part in reducing the speard. EOS 3 0 12 yes I agree also. It' s hard though and it was getting to me even more middle of this year. I was more affected and more emotional. So I do see that I am getting used to it, though how long is uncertain, as the cases rise again. So hopefully I can stay well mentally. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Every night, I give myself an hour to unwind and relax. Things like, enjoying a movie, snack, drink or even favorite candle helps a lot.. EOS 3 0 14 and yeah, that' s the best we can do for now, as you say, is follow the rules and science, and do our part.. ignore the naysayers and compromisers. that' s really good. the relaxation technique, I mean. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Exactly, keep calm and relax. Avoid any negative vibes. Aim is to distress yourself. EOS 3 0 16 yeah I take time every now and then off from my studies, but my schedules are not set or consistent, and I procrastinate a lot. So that when I fall behind on a typical day, I try to catch up and end up not having enoug h time to even work out at home, or feel tired and sleepy, when I should have finished with my academic work early in the day. yeah that' s good advice. I will keep trying to tune out and filter the negativity and daily news. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m on the same boat. Build yourself a well structure schedule and aim to follow it. Trust me if accomplish 90% of it, that one hour me time will feel even better.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 3 0 1 Hello. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, i feel like i am in depsression. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed?? EOS 3 0 5 My partner broke up with me impromptu. EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now. EOS 3 0 7 Exactly, that is my current situation. I feel like my entire life has been rearranged. How did you deal with them and specifically what was your coping mechanism? EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days. I slowly realised that i had put myself in slow motion and then slowly started to do things i used to do to maybe come out of it. EOS 3 0 9 True, what ways would you suggest i use to approach my situation and get out of this state? It is very pathetic really when you think of it, halting all your life activities and plans just because a relationship ended. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well i had a close friend that i was able to vent to and help me see what was important. Do you have anyone close in your life you could talk to for guidance? EOS 3 0 11 Close friends can really be helpful in such situations. Yes, i do have a close friend even though i am very poor when it comes to opening up. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see what you mean about pathetic lol. But rather than see yourself as pathetic in a negative, use that defiance to push yourself back out into the world. Start slowly with opening up, maybe even tell your friend you intent and ask them to be patient as you learn to better express your inner feelings. EOS 3 0 13 Yes, i should do that because at the end of it all i still have myself to take care of. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think youre already on the right track. I just know you can get back to you! EOS 3 0 15 Opening up is a skill that i could do better at because i have never been the open type. But with a little practice i could get better at it. I have to get better no matter what. Are there other tactics you can share with me with regards to my current situation? EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are resources online that perhaps you could look into to help with expressing yourself.
4 0 0 I' m feeling really sad, I thought it was going somewhere. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What do you mean you thought it was going somewhere? Are you okay? EOS 4 0 2 yes I' m okay, I' m so sad. five years, I gave my heart to this girl. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Did you guys break up recently? EOS 4 0 4 yes she broke my heart last night, what did I do wrong? EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong. You shouldn' t blame yourself. EOS 4 0 6 but I gave her my all. I feel so betrayed. I' m feeling so sad I want to jump over a bridge. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there, a few years before I was married, my boyfriend broke up with me. We had some space, and then were able to become friends again. And you know what? We ended up getting back together and getting married. EOS 4 0 8 you think it' s my fault? 5 years man, 5 years and just like that she broke my heart. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t give up, you never know what the future holds. I don' t know your particular situation, but it takes two to make relationships work. I don' t think you should blame yourself. EOS 4 0 10 thank you, will try to keep my head up. you think she cheated on me? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] I don' t know what happened. Is that what you think happened? EOS 4 0 12 well I don' t know. why end so abruptly. EOS 4 1 13 [Question] What did she say when you broke up? EOS 4 0 14 she just said it' s over! over the damn phone. EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Yikes! I' m sure that didn' t feel very good. EOS 4 0 16 not at all, so heart broken. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] Have you tried talking to her since? Oftentimes people have confused feelings and after some time to reflect, things might change..
4 0 0 Hi I am so sad my boyfriend was cheating and broke up with me when I found out. I don' t think I can ever be happy again. EOS 4 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self - esteem is that true? EOS 4 0 2 I have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. I have lost interest in everything I can barely make myself go to work. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better? EOS 4 0 4 Maybe, why would he cheat? I have seen her she is not that pretty. I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination. EOS 4 1 5 [Others] remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren' t right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else. EOS 4 0 6 I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn' t want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn' t mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that. EOS 4 0 8 I trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. I thought we were so perfect together, I don' t want him back I could never trust him again, I am not sure I could trust any guy right now, I am so hurt and confused. I don' t ever want to feel like this again. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] relationship issues, especially when they and suddenly can be one of the most stressful periods in an adults life. you are not alone in that other people have been through similar experiences themselves.
3 1 0 [Question] Hi! Hope you are doing well? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, yes am doing well. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Glad to know that you are doing well. How may I assist you today? EOS 3 0 3 I had a drinking challenge which has been affecting my marriage for quit sometime now. EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So as far as I understand that you had issues with your wife due to your drinking. Am I right? EOS 3 0 5 Yes that is true. EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is really a serious problem. I know it must be very tough time for you. Hope you are trying your best to save your marriage.
5 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. I' m here to listen. EOS 5 0 1 The unemployment office is overwhelmed and I' m overwhelmed trying to help my family member.

3 0 0 Hi, how are you today? I feel really sad all the time. I don' t know why. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] hello. you feel sad, why? EOS 3 0 2 I' m not sure. I can' t find a reason. My health is fine. I have friends. I have a place to live. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] your health is fine and you have place to live but you are still sad. EOS 3 0 4 Yes, that' s right. I feel like my life is not going in the right direction. In fact, I' m not going anywhere. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] have you talked to anyone about it. EOS 3 0 6 No, not really. I don' t know what to talk about. I just feel flat. Something' s wrong. I don' t know what. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i have felt that way before but i came over it. EOS 3 0 8 How did you do that? I really need some guidance here. What do I do? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] it came to me like a mood swing for so many days but i started going to meet friends and get closer to my friends for positive vibes. EOS 3 0 10 You met with your friends? I' ve tried meeting with my friends. I feel ok when I' m with them, but then later, I feel sad again. I can' t spend all my time with my friends, of course. They have things to do. So do I. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, you have to be positive at all time and always do something that makes you happy. EOS 3 0 12 I' m trying to be positive. It doesn' t seem to work. I don' t know how to change my mood without chemicals. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you try yoga or meditating as a therapy. EOS 3 0 14 No, I haven' t tried yoga. I thought it was for women. Therapy? You mean like a shrink? EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yoga is not only for women, and yes therapy like a shrink but you don' t have to talk to anybody if you do yoga or meditating.
2 0 0 hi. EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hey! How are you? EOS 2 0 2 trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once:( EOS 2 1 3 [Question] What are these thoughts?:) EOS 2 0 4 Its so stupid. I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts just come so fast. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while. EOS 2 0 6 tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes I cant controll the thoughts or like I dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing. EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] A chemical thing, so maybe you need a counsellor, and then he can assess your problem, and everything will be alright:) EOS 2 0 8 I have one and it helps sometimes. I try to meditate. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. Does it help you? If it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently. EOS 2 0 10 i pretty much have to do it constantly. EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not constantly. because then you won' t have anytime to do anything else, but if negative thoughts always come into your head, maybe try doing something you enjoy doing. EOS 2 0 12 yeah maybe its as simple as that. I know Im the problem cause its very obvious that im the on ein control of the thoughts for the most part. EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, maybe. But always look at the bright side of stuff and maybe the negative thoughts can stop.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 0 0 2 Just feeling sad. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad? EOS 0 0 4 Not being able to leave the house with Covid. plus my hours were cut at work. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut. What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time? EOS 0 0 6 Yes it sucks. I live alone now so there really hard sometimes. I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos. Nothing productive. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it' s not the same as face to face. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I have one close friend that I talk to every now and then. Its not like it use to be. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That' s still a win.

EOS 0 0 7 I live in a hotel currently. No family or friends around, especially with the virus. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What do you do for work? Are you able to get out of the hotel frequently?
3 0 0 hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 i am ok so far. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 4 i am depressed. and need some inspiration. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression? EOS 3 0 6 Covid - 19. and money issues. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, this has really been a hard time for all of us. How has it impacted you personally? EOS 3 0 8 my mom and sister had caught the virus they are doing ok now but it was rough. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how hard that must have been. I' m glad they are doing ok now though! EOS 3 0 10 yeah me too. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] How have you been using your time during the crisis? EOS 3 0 12 yeah mostly working and meditation. EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] That' s great! Meditation is also something I' ve picked up during this time. It' s really helpful and can keep you balanced. Do you have a routine or do you just do it sporadically? EOS 3 0 14 i mostly do it sporadically but i do need to do it more often. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It' s great to try to integrate it into your day. All of us tend to have at least a few moments each day to ourselves. Even if it' s during a shower or bathroom break, you really can meditate anywhere! It' s all about being in the here and now.
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m really stressed with school exams. and I' m struggling with anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Ah that sounds tough, why exactly are you stressed? EOS 0 0 4 I have 3 big exams coming up at the same time, and they' re all really important for my final grade. I know I' m going to badly because I haven' t been learning well during the pandemic. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Okay, I understand, I see how that can also make your anxiety worse. Currently, on a scale of 1 - 10 how well are you understanding your course material? EOS 0 0 6 Probably 4. My roommates are just so loud and inconsiderate, I can' t make any progress studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s completely normal you haven' t made any progress. That would make things so hard and I applaud you for coming so far with that going on! EOS 0 0 8 I guess so. But if I fail or do badly on my exams it' s really not going to be good. I' m on a scholarship and have to keep above a 3. 0 gpa. EOS 0 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Would you say your problems start with your roommates? EOS 0 0 10 They' re the biggest problem right now. But I think having to learn from home is the main problem. It' s so hard in a tiny room with just a laptop. No library, no office hours, no study groups. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand, the same goes for me. It can be hard to keep up with grade expectations especially when money is on the line.
1 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How may I help you today? EOS 1 0 1 hi. I am stressed with my 25 year old moved back from NYC.. My boyfriend and I have a home and my son does not like him. EOS 1 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that i can understand how you must be feeling. Why does your son not like your boyfriend? EOS 1 0 3 He is going back to school and I am supporting him in that. The problem is that my boyfriend thinks my son should speak to me more respectfully. He gets upset when my son is swears and shows anger to me. EOS 1 1 4 [Question] Have you talked to your boyfriend about how you are feeling? EOS 1 0 5 He knows that I am torn. I am not going to put my son out of the house. I am also not one to get loud and angry. My son verbally is aggressive. EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand why your boyfriend be getting upset if your son is disrespectful to you and is aggressive but you know that is your son and you going to be there for him no matter what. EOS 1 0 7 Yes, and I have gotten my son to go to a therapist weekly to try to express his anger about the pandemic and the changes it has brought in his lifestyle. He cannot take his frustrustations out on us. EOS 1 1 8 [Question] How long has this been going on? Is the therapist working for him? EOS 1 0 9 He came back last March for what we thought at the time would be a month or two. EOS 1 1 10 [Question] Have you had a conversation with your son about the way he is acting? EOS 1 0 11 He is difficult to get through to. He seems to have traded midwestern charm for NYC bullying. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe he should start seeing a therapist every day maybe that will help. EOS 1 0 13 I am not sure that he can afford that, but I have seen small changes in his behavior since he started seeing her. I want him to stop seeing my boyfriend as the enemy. EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe your boyfriend and your son needs to sit down and have a talk. EOS 1 0 15 That may work with a therapist. I have tried to mediate and both were terribly bull headed and argumentative. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] or you know your boyfriend can plan out a day or something and your son and your boyfriend can go out and do something fun.
0 0 0 Hi. Hello, can you help me? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I hope so. What kind of problem are you having? EOS 0 0 2 I am really struggling with my studies at the moment, I am so anxious that I keep putting off my essays and worrying all the time. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are a student who is having trouble. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, I am a mature student and struggling with my course. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand how you feel. I was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school. It is very understandable that you are feeling stressed, especially with the pandemic and other issues happening. EOS 0 0 6 yes, the pandemic is making it worse. I am working as well so I am struggling juggling them all and running a house. I just don' t know how to get back on track with my studying.

EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you go online, there are different templates for students. One would be a time management template where you fill in the blocks of different times of the day. Also, do you know any of your classmates that you could email or text for support?
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one. EOS 4 0 16 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. What else can I do besides meditation? EOS 4 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds? EOS 4 0 18 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. Candles are much better for me. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil. EOS 4 0 20 I haven' t heard of that website before. I' ll have to check it out. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships. EOS 4 0 22 Well, I haven' t been in a long - term relationship like this before.. My past relationships were all in high school, and they only lasted a few weeks or months at a time. I really cared for this one, and we were together for so long. EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] I feel obligated to help during Christmas because I had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts. EOS 4 0 24 You had a fight with your partner? I' m sorry, it' s the worst when people fight over what' s supposed to be something nice. EOS 4 1 25 [Question] What was the fight over? Food? Money? Sex? EOS 4 0 26 I forget what started it, it was something stupid. He didn' t like the way I said something and it kind of blew up from there. We were fighting over the smallest things these last few months. It just kind of built up to the point where he said he couldn' t take fighting with me anymore and just wanted to end it. EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would let things decompress for a long while. EOS 4 0 28 End the relationship, I mean. You think maybe if we just take some time apart, he might want to talk about it? EOS 4 1 29 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest thinking through ending the relationship if he has a hot temper.. EOS 4 0 30 He does get upset very easily. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, just think it through for some time..
2 0 0 Hello. Maybe you can help me calm down. I just found out that I' m losing my job in January.( 1) EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hello! I hope I can. I am so sorry to hear that. That' s so rough. There are so many people going through this right now. EOS 2 0 2 Yes and that worries me even more. More people competing for the same jobs.( 2) EOS 2 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a fare worry but you can' t be discourged. YOu need to think positively. You can use this as a time to reconnect with family and to get your resume together. EOS 2 0 4 I will have to do a new resume definitely. It' s been awhile.( 3) EOS 2 1 5 [Question] That' s a good activity!! Do you have anyone who can help you with it? EOS 2 0 6 I' ll have to think on that, I have a friend that might be able to help but it' s been awhile for both of us( 4) EOS 2 1 7 [Question] Do you have any hobbies you can work on while you' re home? EOS 2 0 8 Well I don' t think they are hobbies, but there are things that need to be done around the house. Guess I can keep myself busy at least( 5) EOS 2 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s really helpfuL! staying busy is good. It' s also really good time to reconnect with a loved ones and friends. You can try virtual connections. EOS 2 0 10 Yes, but I know I' ll also have a lot of work to do to get ready to find a new job. I' m really hoping I can find one before I lose this one( 6) EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] HAve you been searching online sites? They post so many nowadays! If you spend a few hours a day. i' m sure that you' ll find one in no time!! EOS 2 0 12 I looked at indeed and I did apply to one thing. But when it came back to me it said that 4970 other people had applied for the same job!( 7) EOS 2 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That happens but keep looking. It' s a numbers game, so you have to just apply to a ton them once your resume is ready. EOS 2 0 14 I wish I knew how to make myself stand out more. So many people are out there looking for work.( 8) EOS 2 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online career counselors or resume helpers, they can help you figure out how to make your resume stand out. What industry are you in?
0 0 0 Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, what seems to be on your mind?. EOS 0 0 2 Friends and our relationships amongst one another. Two are arguing and I want to help both. We only can facetime each other because of Corona and it is taking a toll among our group. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I see. How long have your two friends been arguing? EOS 0 0 4 It has been around 4 months now. It started slowly and now has ramped up to where it' s exploding and causing discourse among us all. One of my friends told a secret to another acquaintance outside of our group. My friend is raging over this which she should. trust was broken. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like tempers are all running pretty hot for everyone right now, is that correct? EOS 0 0 6 I believe in forgiveness, and the friend that told is very remorseful How do I help them? EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Well, it sounds like you are in a tough spot since both your friends are so mad at each other.. Why do you think your one friends shared a secret they were supposed to keep? EOS 0 0 8 The acquaintance knew something of the secret because she had experienced this before. I think my friend was more - so trying to help my other friend, not betray her. She went outside the group but not for spitrful reasons i think. EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I think I understand. Sometimes we accidentally hurt the people we love when we are trying to help.
1 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 1 0 1 I am just a little angry. My mother and I had another blow - up. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother? EOS 1 0 3 It is why I am angry. This occurs at least every other day. I say something harmless and she thinks I am saying it in a way that is rude or something. EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you can figure out a way to communicate better. EOS 1 0 5 I do not know for sure where to start. If I try to tell her that is not what I mean it is like she doesn' t understand? EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to feel misunderstood. EOS 1 0 7 For example today I was just saying I like the food she had cooked us for supper. She took that to mean I never liked the food she made before. She says I do not appreciate her and I should be grateful to have her. EOS 1 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing your best to be nice but it isn' t getting through. EOS 1 0 9 Maybe it was the way she was brought up that she is so sensitive. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everybody has stuff from their past that affects them. EOS 1 0 11 But they should not take how they feel on others right? But I know I have to be understanding. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You should be understanding, especially since you already know this.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi! What' s on your mind tonight?. EOS 4 0 1 I think a friend I' ve known for 30 years since college has drifted away from me. Even during the pandemic she has made new friends. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, I' m sorry, that' s not fun at all, especially since you two have been friends for so long. Have you tried reaching out to her by phone, email or social media?. EOS 4 0 3 She has cut our conversations short by saying she is tried. She will return text but I feel like I am always initiating. She likes watching tv show and told me with her NEW friend they Facetime and watch TV together. I really hate watching TV so don' t want to offer to participate. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, it' s a positive sign that she hasn' t blocked you completely. I agree, texting her each day could irritate her. That' s okay! You shouldn' t do anything that isn' t fun or enjoyable or comfortable for either of you, in my opinion. EOS 4 0 5 I am jealous that she is more successful in making new friends. I have not made a new friend in over 10 years. EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life. EOS 4 0 7 I don' t have many other friends and they are out of state. The one we are talking about lived an hour away but we would see each other 4 to 6 times a year, EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you' re saying you feel hurt and depressed at not being able to make new friends easily in the pandemic, correct? Ahhhh.,..... yes that; s difficult, oh boy. EOS 4 0 9 Hurt, mad, jealous. I have trouble getting out enough to make friends - even if there wasn' t a pandemic. I work a lot. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] For the time being we' re all stuck at home mostly, so maybe take some comfort in that in a strange way. Heck I rarely see my friends - maybe once a year, so I know how that feels. EOS 4 0 11 Good to know I' m not alone. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] On the bright side of things, at least you have a job. Do you enjoy your job? Maybe start friendships with coworkers, possibly. EOS 4 0 13 Work place is very small and I' m not in the clique there. Vaccine will be available to my age group soon and the weather is getting warmer. So there is that to look forward too. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] How often do you get out for fresh air? Sure it' s not going to solve the lack of friends but it does help to clear your mind to go outside the next few months after work. EOS 4 0 15 Good idea. I really hope being able to take walks will help me clear my thoughts. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, I agree with you, the warmer weather with the vaccine will probably speed up the end of all this. Cabin fever is real.

I am working as well so I am struggling juggling them all and running a house. I just don' t know how to get back on track with my studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about putting together a schedule to help you manage your time? EOS 0 0 8 How would I go about that? EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you go online, there are different templates for students. One would be a time management template where you fill in the blocks of different times of the day. Also, do you know any of your classmates that you could email or text for support? EOS 0 0 10 okay, I can see the sense in that. Have you used them before, if so would you recommend putting everything on there or keeping it flexible? I do have a couple that i could contact, I' ve been feeling really embarrassed to contact them, like they might think I am being silly. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] To start, fill in one week to see what all activities you have to do. Set aside specific time for doing your schoolwork. Try and stick with the schedule. EOS 0 0 12 Okay, one week doesn' t seem too scary. I could colour coordinate it, I like things in colour. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] . I would try it. EOS 0 0 14 Ok, do you think I should reach out to my classmates, will they think i' m being silly, I really don' t want to alienate them. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe there is a discussion board where you could be anonymous. Break your writing down in small chunks. Just brainstorm one day, for example. EOS 0 0 16 I don' t think so, however, I might just start with the template and see if that helps first. I like the idea of breaking things into the chunks. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try one thing at a time so you are not overwhelmed. EOS 0 0 18 Thank you, I feel a little better, maybe I just needed some control. Yes, that' s good, one thing at once. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I agree. You are not alone. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you, you have been really helpful. EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hang in there. It is great that you are in school.
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why? EOS 4 0 8 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID - 19 lockdowns. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] How long have you been working there? EOS 4 0 10 I am very sad about this country and my work situation. For 5 years. I work in accounting. EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID - 19 really has got us all down. EOS 4 0 12 What a great nation we live in..... a future 3rd world one. Yeah, but I was a good accountant. EOS 4 1 13 [Others] WOW, I' m sure that is a big change for you...
2 0 0 Good evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hi, how' s things? EOS 2 0 2 Things are ok I am just having issues with the problem above. EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I am afraid that I am not able to see that.. can you tell me about it? EOS 2 0 4 Yes, so I have always done very well in school and university. I have always had A' s or high B' s. Last semester in university, I failed one of my exams. I still passed the class with an A, but for some reason, that exam haunts me and gives me bad dreams. I don' t know why it happens and it worries me. EOS 2 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - when I was sitting my final exams I constantly had nightmares about failing. Nearly thirty years on and I still do!! But - you did really very well and you passed with an A. Do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself? EOS 2 0 6 Maybe, I got a 46% on the exam( so an F) but I did all my other assignments and exams almost perfect and got an A overall. I never once failed a test in my life, and have always held myself to a very high academic degree to make my parents proud. I come from a poor family, so succeeding in life is very important to m, e. me* EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds as though you feel that academic success is the most important thing in your life, would I be right in thinking this? EOS 2 0 8 Yes you are correct. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered talking to anyone about these feelings of perfectionism? A therapist perhaps? There is a good deal of useful help and information out there for people who are struggling.
0 0 0 Hello, I' m having a terrible day. My name is Sean and I work for a large distribution company. EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] hi! i' m sorry to hear that. how is your work going so far. EOS 0 0 2 The problem with a job like Amazon or Kehe distribution is the quotas. The pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID? EOS 0 0 4 no COVID 19 has nothing to do with any of this work. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how anxious you are right now. Can you give me some more info on your job.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 0 0 1 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am doing great, how about you? EOS 0 0 3 I am doing good. Can I talk to you about something? EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course you can, tell me about it:) EOS 0 0 5 I am worried that I won' t be able to complete my degree. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Why so? EOS 0 0 7 I can' t get motivated, it doesn' t seem worth it. EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Hey I' ve been there too, but it really helped me meditating and going out with nature to clear my mind of things. You should try it!
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello.:) How are you? EOS 0 0 1 I am okay. A little anxious I am feeling helpless. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am sorry to hear that. What are you feeling helpless about? EOS 0 0 3 I am worried about upcoming bills. I lost my job. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I see. I would be worried about that as well. How long have you been out of work? EOS 0 0 5 About 2 weeks. Christmas is right around the corner. I dont know how I am going to get the kids presents. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anyone you are able to ask for support right now, like your parents? I am sure they would understand, since so many people have been losing jobs lately. EOS 0 0 7 I don' t have a lot if family.. I have my sister who lives far away. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I see. And your kids are depending on you to be able to take care of them. I am so sorry; I know that must be extremely stressful. Are you married right now? If so, does your spouse have a job? EOS 0 0 9 Yes, my kids are older, yes I am married and he is working. He isnt easy to talk to.. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] I see. Do you mean that you are not on good terms with him? EOS 0 0 11 Its off and on. Some days are better than others.. I think its just the weather. Its cold. Gloomy that doesn' t help either. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I can understand that. It' s been cold and gloomy over here and my whole family has been in a bad mood. It seems like a little thing, but I find that taking Vitamin D supplements when the weather is bad helps me not to get depressed. EOS 0 0 13 I am just ready for 2021. It has been a scary year all around. Hmm, Maybe I should try that.. EOS 0 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Yep. Me too. I' m ready for all of this mess to be over.

3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 3 0 1 Hello. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, i feel like i am in depsression. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed?? EOS 3 0 5 My partner broke up with me impromptu. EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now. EOS 3 0 7 Exactly, that is my current situation. I feel like my entire life has been rearranged. How did you deal with them and specifically what was your coping mechanism? EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days. I slowly realised that i had put myself in slow motion and then slowly started to do things i used to do to maybe come out of it. EOS 3 0 9 True, what ways would you suggest i use to approach my situation and get out of this state? It is very pathetic really when you think of it, halting all your life activities and plans just because a relationship ended. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well i had a close friend that i was able to vent to and help me see what was important. Do you have anyone close in your life you could talk to for guidance? EOS 3 0 11 Close friends can really be helpful in such situations. Yes, i do have a close friend even though i am very poor when it comes to opening up. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see what you mean about pathetic lol. But rather than see yourself as pathetic in a negative, use that defiance to push yourself back out into the world. Start slowly with opening up, maybe even tell your friend you intent and ask them to be patient as you learn to better express your inner feelings. EOS 3 0 13 Yes, i should do that because at the end of it all i still have myself to take care of. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think youre already on the right track. I just know you can get back to you! EOS 3 0 15 Opening up is a skill that i could do better at because i have never been the open type. But with a little practice i could get better at it. I have to get better no matter what. Are there other tactics you can share with me with regards to my current situation? EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are resources online that perhaps you could look into to help with expressing yourself. EOS 3 0 17 Is there any particular resource you can refer me to? EOS 3 1 18 [Others] Yes just a moment. EOS 3 0 19 Waiting, thank you. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I was going to send you a few links but it wont let me. EOS 3 0 21 Ooh too bad. Could you just name a few then i can look them up on my own later? EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] instead try googling the phrase" how to open up to others" and there should be a few sites with tips and references. EOS 3 0 23 Ok that' s rather helpful. EOS 3 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] healthyplace. com has a good article.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? I' d love to chat with you! What' s been on your mind? EOS 3 0 1 oh hello. I' m having problems with friends - or more precisely the lack of them. I don' t have any. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see. You feel as though you don' t have any friend' s currently? I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It' s so hard to see people and keep relationships right now. EOS 3 0 3 Well it' s more that I think I' ve never had friends. Not anyone I can confide in or laugh with. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a really hard thing to be going through. I' m sorry to hear that. Do you have any really close family members that you are able to confide in?

I haven' t been doing well in my academics. EOS 2 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I have a real talent to provide guidance to people out there in the World. Not doing well in college or high school? Are you in a trade school? Or in academia? EOS 2 0 5 In college. I started off really well until the pandemic hit. Now my family is struggling financially and it has greatly affected my academics. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Well, I went through a similar situation when a pink - eye breakout hurt my school.... I struggled financially, but took any job I could..... EOS 2 0 7 What kind of jobs did you take? EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Work part - time and go to school part - time. EOS 2 0 9 I' m trying to find a steady job. jobs that can help support both my family and my tuition. EOS 2 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest creating flyers and ask to be a dog walker. Americans love their dogs. 70 Percent of Americans have dogs.
0 0 0 hey. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m good, busy. I need another job to pay more bills. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having a difficult time with your finances. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 yes somewhat. i can pay it off within 2 - 3 years without a second job. id like to pay it off faster though. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure it will take dedication and hard work, but I bet you can do it! EOS 0 0 6 I think so. Im doing mturk for a second job right now. it helps some. i don' t know about getting another job. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been in your shoes and also feel that' s a good way to add a little extra income. It can really add up if left to built and used towards a specific goal.
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night.
3 0 0 Hi. I am Mike. Live in central Kansas and have been very depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that, is there a particular reason or instance for you feeling this way? EOS 3 0 2 I lost my job due to Covid and they have shut down for good. no jobs around here and no vehicle so i feel hopeless and hate my living situation. just before covid hit i was saving to move... but then job closed. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes that is a very tough situation, Covid has real placed a large amount of stress through out the world. There may be a ray of hope however with a possible vaccine in the near future, maybe this will be back to normal soon and new jobs will become available. EOS 3 0 4 I hope so and that is what i know mentally. but emotionally it is hard. i just hate having no job, being at home, no money, no vehicle, and a very bad idea to date since there is a high contagious pandemic. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand and you are right it is a a lot of mental stress. Have you reached out to claim unemployment or go to a food pantry? During this pandemic you should not feel shameful to take advantage of these services, there are alot of people who have to ask for help for the first time in their lives. EOS 3 0 6 I did not make enough to get unemployment they said. I have not tried a food pantry but that is a great idea. what makes this difficult is I am in a very small town. like we dont wal marts or McDonalds or anything like that. Whole town closes at 9. the closest actual city is 45 miles away. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well please try the food pantry and see what they have to offer. Is there anyone whom you could ask for a ride in the future when they go to the bigger city? EOS 3 0 8 I will try food pantry. my sister goes to the city once a month, we shop for the month and i stay with my siter. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well its seem that you now have a plan try it out see how it works, hopefully this will get back to normal sooner than later and life may go back to somewhat normal and your stress level and mental exhaustion will also subside. Is there anything else you would like to talk about? EOS 3 0 10 Well I have been wanting a relationship. and i normally dont feel that way at all. and past week i think how much i kind of should have a family as I am 37 but not sure if i truly want that or i just miss human contact as i have only been around family and not gone out at all except to walk and go to store in town, and am confused if it is actully me wanting somone in my life or just a physical thing. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think your exactly right, human contact is now a premium and I' m sure you miss that contact that we were once so use to. Missing the contact makes you realize how much you enjoy the company of others. Take it slow and once the vaccine is out ease your way back into the dating scene and see if a relationship is what you really wanted after all. EOS 3 0 12 yeah i mean emotionally i want to go maybe try a date or two or even just an adult night out but know logically it is a VERY risky idea. And that I need to not do anything like that till next year at the minimum. I do appreciate the advice and ideas. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] Remember that age is only a number and love will no no number, we are hear to listen and support you so if you ever need to talk just know we are a mouse click away.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi my name is Sarah, how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hi, Sarah. I am at my wits end. I feel like I am going crazy. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That sounds stressful. What' s happening? EOS 0 0 3 I am stressed out about having to move and I just can' t seem to calm down when it is time to sleep.. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Moving is such a stressful time. When do you move?.
4 0 0 I feel sad, and feel like need help. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you identify why you feel sad? EOS 4 0 2 yes, my aunt pass away a couple weeks ago. and since then im feeling really sad. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is natural to feel sad when someone you care about dies. EOS 4 0 4 IS there something I can do to feel better? EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are you with family? Sometimes it helps to be with others who are grieving? EOS 4 0 6 No, I live alone, my family lives in another state. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being by yourself is rough after a death. Can you talk with your family by phone? Do you have a friend who has gone through a similar loss? EOS 4 0 8 I feel like everybody is in their own bussines and have no time to hear my complains. I talk to my family, but the whole family is not doing really fine. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you feel people think you are complaining when you talk about your Aunt' s death making you sad. Is that correct? EOS 4 0 10 yes. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Do you feel you are complaining? EOS 4 0 12 yes, I feel like noone wants to listen. I need to do something by mnyself. Can you recommend someting for me to do to feel better? EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] My own experiences with family deaths is they are sad. I just wanted to" feel better". My experience was it did not help to complain about" being sad" but it did help to talk about why I missed my family member. If no one was available, sometimes I would journal. Do you think that might help you?
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing? EOS 6 0 1 I' m doing okay.. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you want to talk about? EOS 6 0 3 I' m having problems with getting up everyday and doing my daily routine. I feel bad because these are things that other people do normally. EOS 6 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah, I' ve definitely felt that way... especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day? EOS 6 0 5 Exactly. Jogging, eating breakfast, getting dressed. EOS 6 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yep, for me it' s kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just" take a break" from grinding. MTurk has kind of helped me get back in a working mindset and given me more energy... have you been doing a lot of MTurk lately? EOS 6 0 7 Yeah, 2020 has been a crazy year. I' ve been doing Mturk here and there. I plan on doing it more. It helps me stay productive. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah it helps, just forcing yourself to have goals, for sure. I' ve been determined to hit a number on MTurk and exercise every time I' m feeling tired, instead of taking a nap because my boss can' t see me, lol. I would definitely say just start setting goals and try to look forward to 2021 being better. EOS 6 0 9 Okay, I hear you. Thanks. Yeah, I guess I have to really force myself. EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Force yourself at first, then the" body in motion, stays in motion" law will take over.:) All I know, is that nothing is worse than ending a day without a sense of accomplishment and then stringing those kinds of days together. EOS 6 0 11 Okay okay. cool. That' s a helpful concept. I' m going to force myself to get up and then hopefully my body will get used to it. Yes, that' s true. I hate ending the day knowing I' ve bummed it out. EOS 6 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] One of the things I' ve noticed about 2020 and I think this contributes is that this year has taken away almost all incentives... you know before it would be like," I' m looking forward to this concert, or this movie coming out next weekend." So, when you aren' t planning things and don' t have these milestones throughout the year of events breaking up the monotony, it stinks. EOS 6 0 13 Yes, I agree. I used to go to at least one concert every year. Now that' s out of the question. It gets boring and a little depressing. Hopefully 2021 will be better. EOS 6 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m sure it will be. Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the MTurk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills. EOS 6 0 15 I will definitely. I just got to get up and get with it. I' m really in need of some exercise so I' ll do that too. I used to paint and draw but I kind of fell off and stopped doing it. I' ll get back into that too. EOS 6 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] Oh yeah, nothing is worse than losing joy in something you love doing. But, getting back in an active mindset helps. I used to love to have bonfires, it really was therapeutic for me but then I just lost the will to have them. Since I' ve been back on MTurk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks, I had one on Saturday and really enjoyed it. So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn' t because we grow out of them, it' s quite frankly because we are probably just depressed. EOS 6 0 17 I agree fully and I' m happy for you. I think I' ve been in some sort of depression for some time now. I stopped doing everything I loved. I used to love jogging but I stopped doing that too. I ended up gaining a lot of weight and now I don' t like going anywhere or being seen at all. I' m usually 130 and I' ve shot up to 200. So I think if I can just get my routine down and exercise, I' ll be alright. EOS 6 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yep for sure, just get back at it and learn to love it again. Anyways, good talking to you!
4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days.

EOS 4 0 18 maybe overwatch. i haven' t been playing them much. EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] i' m wondering: are you a reader? do you enjoy reading? i' m asking because i find when i read a good book, time seems to move very quickly. EOS 4 0 20 i am. but i have a hard time focusing as of late. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can make a goal of reading a few pages and then see if you can build on that. then, if you want, you can make a goal of reading a chapter. EOS 4 0 22 that' s a great idea. that may help a lot with focus. EOS 4 1 23 [Self-disclosure] personally i love reading; especially non fiction. what type of books do you enjoy?

4 1 0 [Question] Hi, what brings you to seek support, today? EOS 4 0 1 I am having ongoing depression. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin? EOS 4 0 3 I have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It first began a couple of weeks ago. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I am sad and anxious about the coronavirus. I miss seeing my friends and family. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you must really care about your friends and family, and this awful pandemic is prevent your from seeing them. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, definitely. I hope the pandemic will end. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all? EOS 4 0 9 I haven' t thought about dying at all. I take medication each day for my depression, but there are times when I still feel sad. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay, thanks for sharing that personal information. I only ask because thoughts of suicide are normal and anxiety and depression increase the chances of suicide. EOS 4 0 11 You' re welcome. I understand, but I am not suicidal. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] What would you like to talk about, then? We could talk about the problem more, or if you feel like it is defined, we could talk about solutions, or not talk about solutions at all. What would make you feel better?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello. How can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 What should I do. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Tell me about the situation that you are facing.

EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and I got an offer in February right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you. I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family. EOS 0 0 9 I don' t know what types of jobs that fit me. yeah, but it is still rough to get by. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] Tell me more about it if you don' t mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking? EOS 0 0 11 I worked in manufacturer. technical skill in trade school but not degree from college. EOS 0 1 12 [Others] I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position?

EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me.

3 0 0 I am feeling depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about your feelings? EOS 3 0 2 I feel lost and lonely, i do not know what to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] When did these feelings come about. EOS 3 0 4 They came about when i lost my job in August of this year. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can understand where your coming from with that, especially since this pandemic occurred. EOS 3 0 6 Yes, finances have especially been very tight. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] it seems like this could be overwhelming to you and trying to figure out the right path to go forward. EOS 3 0 8 It is, have you ever encountered such a situation in your life? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I can relate to you in this situation 100% and if it wasnt for me stepping out on faith and opening my own practice, I wouldnt be here now. EOS 3 0 10 How did you snap out of the situation, did you have some savings? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Always putting money aside when able, and doing lots of research about first time businesses gave a lot of insights. Have you tried to look into things like that yourself? EOS 3 0 12 Yes, i have been researching a lot too but it is difficult given that i have been surviving on the savings i had. Also it is very difficult to get a loan currently. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] That I do understand as well. This pandemic has made it hard for everyone. Are you a parent with any little ones by chance? EOS 3 0 14 Yes, i have two children, 5 and 9 year olds. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] So here is some information that I have in my files to help others during this time. There is self - help. org that is labeled as being a self help during these times. There is also websites that i used like offerup and PoshMark where I was able to start selling some of my belongings to constantly bring in funds. Also try to google" How to become a first time business owner" and see if any of this information helps you and your family.. EOS 3 0 16 That is very helpful of you. I have been wandering all over the internet lost and not knowing where to find help from. I will definitely check this out and make good use of them. Did you also get any funds from anyone? EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know that it can be hard and frustrating during this time, but you have to remain focused for your family and stay strong because I am sure they look up to you. With myself I did have to go to a lot of friends and family, but my faith and my blessings came from God. Looking to him to help with your problems and actually listening to his words would really alleviate some of the stress that is so draining.
0 0 0 I am very worried about losing my job. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello - How are you today? EOS 0 0 2 Anxious. I think my boss wants to fire me. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so sorry you are worried about losing your job. I have been in your shoes before. Why do you think your boss wants to fire you? EOS 0 0 4 Thank you. I think if I am late again, I will be let go.. I have a sick child and my boss does not understand. How can I explain that I may be late to the office, but that I am a valuable employee? EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Have you explained to him your reasoning? I also once had to take care of my sick grandmother after work and had a tough time explaining it to my boss. Have you offered to stay later to make up the work? EOS 0 0 6 No. But that is a good idea. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe your boss can compromise with you. It' s worth a shot! EOS 0 0 8 It' s a very competitive office and I don' t want to look weak. EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] You sound like you care about this job and that is a valuable asset in a an employee. EOS 0 0 10 I do. I hope I can explain the situation clearly and offer to make up time by staying late. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand. Is there a coworker or mentor that maybe you can talk to? EOS 0 0 12 I will reach out to HR. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a great idea! EOS 0 0 14 Thank you. You have been very helpful and uplifting. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Also review your employee handbook and see if there are things you can do to negotiate with HR or your boss in regards to your hours. Always best to come prepared:) EOS 0 0 16 My anxiety is disappearing with the suggestions you have offered. EOS 0 1 17 [Question] That' s great! I am happy I could help you during such a difficult time. How long have you been at the job? EOS 0 0 18 I have only been here for 6 months. I think being new is contributing to the anxiety I am feeling. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. Being new at a job can have its difficulties. From speaking with you, it seems like you are caring and hardworking. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you for your encouragement. EOS 0 1 21 [Greeting] I hope your boss can understand you are facing a difficult time. If he has loved ones or family of his own, he surely will. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed! EOS 7 0 7 And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that' s one method I have used.. Thank you for your trust in me.. EOS 7 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don' t overdo it.. EOS 7 0 9 I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible. true, very true.. Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen? EOS 7 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you. EOS 7 0 11 Thanks for sympathizing and understanding.. EOS 7 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation. EOS 7 0 13 ok. That' s true and I have to do more of that. Phone is also a big distraction for me. I heard that it' s best to get it out of one' s reach for best results.. Timer, great idea.. EOS 7 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I struggl ed with focus but once I put my phone away, my focus increased a lot. EOS 7 0 15 I think that' s pretty good advice. I know which room I can do this, but just away from temptation plus having an alarm from the other room to go off after an hour or so of reading. ok, I will employ these methods more.. Thank you for sharing these. EOS 7 1 16 [Question] Of course! Is anything else on your mind? EOS 7 0 17 then hopefully after these two courses are done, I can have renewed faith and maturity after the new year and take new courses with better results.. not much, just academic pressure and how to deal with time management and being contentious.. EOS 7 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, that sounds like a great idea. It sounds like you' re really trying to help yourself grow. EOS 7 0 19 Yes I hope so, because when I was younger, I used to be great at not being distracted so much in my studies and just bang it out real quick and well with my books. and all this is also worsened by the pandemic, I am afraid, of just not having a renewed from the indoor isolation.. EOS 7 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, it' s true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood. I understand how you' re feeling, COVID has affected me negatively as well but I' m just trying to look at the bright side. EOS 7 0 21 yes it has on us all. I guess the other thing is that my city has been doing fine so far, but just the past two weeks or so has been more and more cases, so just getting stressed and depressed with that and prospects of a second shut down.. so yes, the second wave is here it seems( belatedly), but hopefully it doesn' t get worse, because I have seen worse in other places right now. EOS 7 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I would suggest taking up yoga or meditation to lessen the stress COVID has on your brain. EOS 7 0 23 so I suppose just trying to cope with that also because I get nervous having to go out for work or errands, and I also have to write my exam outside of my home.. ok. I could look into that. I work out in general, but have been slacking off on those ever since the pandemic started this year.. EOS 7 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I' d recommend wearing a mask whenever you go out to lessen the chance of you contracting anything. At the moment, it' s all we could do.
6 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there! How may I support you? EOS 6 0 2 Well, I' m really upset with my friends. EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I am so sorry to hear that. Did something happen?
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, is there anything I can help you with today? EOS 4 0 1 I am really depressed because of my recent break up. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Oh no, that is really sad. I know break ups can be very hard.. EOS 4 0 3 yeah. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel you are depressed about it? Were you together a long time? EOS 4 0 5 i was with her for more then 2 years and without her everthing seems incomplete. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I completely understand. I have had break ups too. They are never easy. EOS 4 0 7 what should i do now? EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Well, if the break up is still fresh, it will take some time before you start feeling yourself again. Breaking up with someone can be as devastating as a death. Because you mourn the loss of the person. What do you think you could do to help yourself feel better? EOS 4 0 9 that is very true. what i need right now is to distract my mind and think about something else. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] What kind of hobbies do you have? Or are you involved in sports or any type of other activities that you enjoy? EOS 4 0 11 i mostly play soccer. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That could be a great distraction. You could start practicing soccer again. You definitely have more time for it now. Do you have anyone you can talk to about the break up? Sometimes talking with a close friend or family member can help a lot too. EOS 4 0 13 I have my best friend and he is also helping me recover but my main issue is inner will power. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] Why do you say that? Are you focused on trying to get back with them? EOS 4 0 15 My mind is just not accepting the change. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] That is difficult. What caused the break up? Was it mutual? Or was it one sided? EOS 4 0 17 it was one sided and that is why it' s so problematic. anyways. EOS 4 1 18 [Question] Ok, so your ex broke up with you. Did they give you a reason why? Or did they just say it' s over and that was it?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello. I need some help. I have been depressed. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you doing today? Do have anything on your mind? Oh i see, well we can talk about that if you like. Has anything happened recently to make you feel this way? EOS 4 0 3 I am not doing very well. Very depressed with having to stay home because of the COVID - 19/ I will appreciate anything you can do to help me. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like social isolation is really weighing on you... EOS 4 0 5 Yes, it sure is. I feel so alone. I feel it will help to talk to an outsider. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Human being are social creatures by nature so please understand that the feelings that you are having are absolutely normal. So dont judge yourself or feel as if something is wrong with YOU. EOS 4 0 7 Sometimes it helps to a stranger - most of my friends feel as I do. I am sure you are right - I thank you for your support.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You mentioned your friends feel the same way you do... Have you guys thought about making trying to do a zoom party? EOS 4 0 9 No, we haven' t talked about that, but that is a great idea. I will talk to them to see how they feel about doing this. Thank you. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have a group of sister friends and we threw a zoom party. we scheduled it out and we decorated our own spaces and we made a spotify playlist that everyone contributed a song to and basically just had a video party. Do you think your frinds may like to try that with you?
3 0 0 hi there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! what seems to be bothering you today? EOS 3 0 2 currently, i am living in a house with my brother, which i co own and can not afford to move out.. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Is living with your brother a bad thing? What specifically is making you upset? EOS 3 0 4 yes it is. he acts like a azz most of the time. he dosent care about anyone but himself. just like his fiancé. he throws away the bills and expects me to pay to keep the utilities on when they are about to be disconnected. then tells me i dont contribute to the house.. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems like he would be a very difficult person to live with. And that is hard for you obviously. I' m thinking your upset because you can' t leave so you' re stuck. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 6 yes, felling very stuck.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s completely normal to feel that way. I' m sure you' re handling the situation as best as you can. What have you done to try and help the situation? EOS 3 0 8 trying to, looking for every way possible to make money and save it up and move out. really dont want to have to partition the property as its the house we grew up in.. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I would feel the same way if that' s a house I grew up in. I' m so sorry! EOS 3 0 10 i tried to talk to him, in his mind its all my fault he cant pay the bills he had before i moved in. i had been living in california for the last few years, but came back with corona virus on the rise there.. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If he' s in a certain mindset, it would be hard to change that. Do you have people to talk to about this? It sounds like a lot to handle. EOS 3 0 12 right? and his fiancé is the same way, they are both alcoholics and spend most of their income on their habits. its all i can do right now to keep food in the house, let alone running water.. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think it would be good for you to talk to someone and get help. Right now, all you can do is keep chugging along and trying your best to stay afloat. EOS 3 0 14 i have a couple of friends that i have talked to about it, but it just seems like i am screaming at a brick wall and nothing changes.. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest talking to a therapist if your insurance can handle that! Talking with them can help you figure out what you should do. EOS 3 0 16 honestly, i think its him that needs the therapist. he is clearly bi polar like my father was, and dosent want to admit to it. several people have tried to talk to him about it but he just denies it and goes to the other room. i know what a the therapist will tell me, that i need to either resolve the conflict or try and move out, hard to do with the epidemic going on and a lack of funds to do it.. is it normal to always feel helpless? cause thats how its been. either rip everything to shreds or do nothing.. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] Yes it is. Especially now. I just want to encourage to keep pushing. Think about yourself in a year or two from now. Do everything you can right now to get out of the situation. If it gets really bad, don' t be afraid to call out for help( like the police). Stay safe and do what' s best for you. You' ve got this!
4 1 0 [Question] HI there, How are you doing today? EOS 4 0 1 Its hard for me to find a job. things could be doing better. it' s been a bad week for me. EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] I understand that, it is hard to find a job. I got terminated during the beginning of covid. EOS 4 0 3 Yea, i got laid off in July. the market has been tough. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I actually took a job at walmart just to make ends meet. Not the best situation but hey, my family can eat.
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Greeting] hi there. How are you? EOS 1 0 2 I am so frustrated. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] May I ask why you are feeling frustrated? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, my school was closed without warning because of COVID. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand how that could make you so frustrated, that would make me frustrated too. I am waiting to hear about my school. EOS 1 0 6 Yes I don' t even know what is going to happen with finals now. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure that whatever happens, you will do well with them. Have you thought about talking to an administrator at your school?
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 6 0 1 hi. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing?
3 0 0 hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hey. How are you?
1 0 0 hi there. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hi! Hope you are doing well. How can I help you today? EOS 1 0 2 I am having such a hard time falling asleep at night.... I toss and turn and cannot shut my mind off. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep. Hope I get it right? EOS 1 0 4 yes that' s right. my mind just races thinking about problems it seems. I am irritable and frustrated. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Is there a specific thing or task which is bothering you for long? EOS 1 0 6 I worry about my daughter, she has addictions. I never know if she is okay or not, she doesn' t call me very often and is hard to get a hold of. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It must be a tough time for you and is a enough reason to not getting good sleep. despite of it you should need a complete rest. EOS 1 0 8 Have you any suggestions to help me get to sleep easier? I have tried meditation, but it doesn' t seem to help much. EOS 1 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I feels like you are having less energy and feel tired due to lack of sleep. Try to follow a particular schedule and u can put soothing music before bed. It might calm you down and make you sleep.
0 0 0 hi there. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m surviving. Today is better than yesterday was. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. What is bothering you?
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi like I said a bit down. EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I did not see that, I am sorry. Do you want to talk about it? It might help. EOS 4 0 3 Ohh thank you for the offer. Proscanation is my thing i guess, and this days I am paying for it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Is it affecting your work or your home life? EOS 4 0 5 Yes it affects everything. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Can you give me an example of something that has been affected recently? For instance, I had been putting off cleaning my house and then some friends dropped by without warning and I was mortified. EOS 4 0 7 I didn' t meet deadline a year back, and lost my job. Now I couldn' t even pay rents. Living with a sibling. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That sounds bad. Have you considered you might be suffering from depression? EOS 4 0 9 Probably. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You sound quite lethargic. I think you should see a GP? EOS 4 0 11 Thank you. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you feel as though life is hopeless and there is no way forward?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi! What' s on your mind tonight?. EOS 4 0 1 I think a friend I' ve known for 30 years since college has drifted away from me. Even during the pandemic she has made new friends. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, I' m sorry, that' s not fun at all, especially since you two have been friends for so long. Have you tried reaching out to her by phone, email or social media?. EOS 4 0 3 She has cut our conversations short by saying she is tried. She will return text but I feel like I am always initiating. She likes watching tv show and told me with her NEW friend they Facetime and watch TV together. I really hate watching TV so don' t want to offer to participate. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, it' s a positive sign that she hasn' t blocked you completely. I agree, texting her each day could irritate her. That' s okay! You shouldn' t do anything that isn' t fun or enjoyable or comfortable for either of you, in my opinion.
1 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 1 0 1 I am just a little angry. My mother and I had another blow - up. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother? EOS 1 0 3 It is why I am angry. This occurs at least every other day. I say something harmless and she thinks I am saying it in a way that is rude or something. EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you can figure out a way to communicate better. EOS 1 0 5 I do not know for sure where to start. If I try to tell her that is not what I mean it is like she doesn' t understand? EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to feel misunderstood. EOS 1 0 7 For example today I was just saying I like the food she had cooked us for supper. She took that to mean I never liked the food she made before. She says I do not appreciate her and I should be grateful to have her. EOS 1 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing your best to be nice but it isn' t getting through. EOS 1 0 9 Maybe it was the way she was brought up that she is so sensitive. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everybody has stuff from their past that affects them. EOS 1 0 11 But they should not take how they feel on others right? But I know I have to be understanding. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You should be understanding, especially since you already know this. EOS 1 0 13 Can you relate to this situation? EOS 1 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have had personal disputes with my parents in the past. Most of the time there' s other things going on that makes a person act different. EOS 1 0 15 Maybe I could just take deep breath and kind of step back a minute before I respond. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It would be good to do that. Maybe try to have a conversation and tell her you support her no matter what she' s going through. EOS 1 0 17 I guess the best time to do that was when she is in a very good mood. EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do some chores or something that helps her out and just let her know you want to have a serious talk some time. EOS 1 0 19 But what if she thinks me helping her out is criticizing the way she does things? That seems like the way she would be. EOS 1 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try giving reassurance that you want to show you care. EOS 1 0 21 I will try this. It is worth a shot. We can' t go through life being upset at each other. EOS 1 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] I feel the same way. I hope you can get things on better terms. EOS 1 0 23 I appreciated the help. I was just so upset. I didn' t want to talk to anyone in our family and have them take sides or make them uncomfortable. EOS 1 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you can set a better example about being open.
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 6 0 1 hi. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing? EOS 6 0 3 Well I' m distraught. EOS 6 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel that way? EOS 6 0 5 Because my girlfriend has left me. EOS 6 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard for you. I haven' t personally had to deal with that, but I have had friends that have. How long were you together? EOS 6 0 7 four years. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being together that long must have made that break up difficult. How are you coping with it? EOS 6 0 9 well I' m not really, especially as she' d gone off with someone else. But I' m to blame which makes it worse. EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened? EOS 6 0 11 I cheated on her on a drunken night. It was a one - off and I regret it terribly. But she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain. EOS 6 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I see how she would be upset. It must be difficult for you though because she didn' t give you another chance. Do you have someone to talk to about your feelings?
4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 tired. and u? EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like an exhausting time for a lot of people right now. I' m also a bit tired but doing OK. What' s been on your mind recently? EOS 4 0 3 just trying to finish this semester. EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like a stressful time to be in college. How have you been coping with everything going on? EOS 4 0 5 listening to music. EOS 4 1 6 [Others] Nice! What kind of music do you like? EOS 4 0 7 mainly hip hop and r& b but I dabble in some alternative, hyperpop, and edm. EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I also like hip hop and r& b. It' s too bad we aren' t able to go to any live music events for a while, though. EOS 4 0 9 yea. have u done any of the virtual concerts? EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I' ve seen them advertised but I haven' t tried any of them yet. I think I saw there was a Lil Nas X one coming up though, might check that out. Have you done any? EOS 4 0 11 yea the travis scott one and the nas one just happened yesterday. think there is only one showing left today then theyre done. it was ok nothing amazing. EOS 4 1 12 [Others] Oh good to know. Yeah, I don' t know if virtual concerts can ever really compare to live ones. EOS 4 0 13 whos some of your favorite artists? EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Well, I' m in my 30s so I like the artists who were big about the time I was in high school/ college since I have fond memories of that. So, artists like Nelly, 50 cent, Eminem. Also I' m from California so I have to say Tupac. What about you?
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. EOS 3 0 16 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. EOS 3 0 18 That is a good point.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. EOS 3 0 20 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand. EOS 3 0 22 I should trust my partner more than any random person. EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters. EOS 3 0 24 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? EOS 3 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you.... even after work.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, I' m here to listen. What' s going on? EOS 0 0 1 Thank you. I' ve lost my job and I' m very nervous about the future. As a result I am having a hard time sleeping. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Wow, that' s very hard. I would be anxious too. EOS 0 0 3 That makes me feel a lot better. Have you ever lost your job? EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I have. I was laid off. It was nerve - racking, but also really sad. EOS 0 0 5 What helped you get through it? EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I had a bit in savings, but I looked for new jobs mostly. I was on unemployment insurance for about a month before I found a new job. Have you made any plans yet about how to move forward? I can offer some suggestions if you would like. I know about a lot of resources. EOS 0 0 7 I am a gig worker, so I cannot apply for IU. Its very hard, but i also have some savings. What kind of tools would you recommend I use to get through this. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, falling back on savings while you look for more work is good for a while. If you have any food insecurity as a result, there are often local food banks. It' s really not something to be embarrased about, so many people face food insecurity through no fault of their own. You could also give a call to your local social services because they will be able to tell you what resources would be available, whether it' s a vocational program or temporary assistance. EOS 0 0 9 Wow you' re so helpful and encouraging! It' s very nice to talk to you.. Are there any meds you can recommend to help me sleep? EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, if it' s possible, I would talk to a doctor. If you' re looking for Over - the - counter sleep medication, melatonin has helped me in the past. EOS 0 0 11 Wow! I' ve never used melatonin before. Did it really help you? Are you doing much better now? EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] It defiitely helps me fall asleep. It' s a natural sleep aid. If something like that doesn' t work, I would talk to a doctor. I know money will be tight though. Are there any free clinics near you?. EOS 0 0 13 I' ll look into it. There' s a lot of services in the general area that might be able to help me. It' s been really nice talking to you. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Thank you. I hope you' re feeling a bit better. Is there anything else you want to talk about?
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, what brings you to bring the seeker? EOS 6 0 1 I feel upset with myself over my situation. Did you read it? EOS 6 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I did not see it. What is your situation? I am here to listen. EOS 6 0 3 I feel ashamed of my depression symptoms. I feel other people are ashamed of me. EOS 6 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how? EOS 6 0 5 I just can' t live reguarly life like" healthy" people do and they notice my symptoms. They don' t understand how your mind can be your enemy. EOS 6 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are saying that you can' t live regularly and people don' t understand that your mind isn' t working in your favor. Is that right? Can you tell me what you mean by your mind being your enemy?
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 0 0 2 Just feeling sad. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad?

Would you mind sharing what is going on? EOS 0 0 5 Long story short, im a recovering alcoholic, 52 days sober, however my mental health has hit me with vengeance and am really struggling day to day. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You are getting out of alcoholism and feeling bad about it emotionally, is that right? EOS 0 0 7 i used alcohol as a self medication. It helped keep bad symtoms of ADHD away. I miss what alcohol used to do for me. EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I understand you pain and frustration. I have very close friend who has ADHD and trying to cope with it. EOS 0 0 9 Thankyou for allowing me some of your time. I would be so much better if my heart wasnt poorly. I could then be medicated properly. As of now i just have to live with it. Kinda sucks. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Are you seeing any counselor to address your challenge? EOS 0 0 11 I feel for your friend. EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you.. you know you are not alone in such journey... EOS 0 0 13 yes i have a therapist and currently on a 10 week post detox intensive plan to keep me focused. I have a good support network.

0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you feeling? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay. Thank you. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i' m okay too. EOS 0 0 4 Thats good. Do you have plans for the holidays? EOS 0 1 5 [Others] not really, i will probably just relax. what about you? EOS 0 0 6 Just hanging out at home with my husband and son. EOS 0 1 7 [Others] how' s your relationship with your family? EOS 0 0 8 It is pretty good. We all get along good. No issues. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] glad to hear so! EOS 0 0 10 How is your relationship with your family? EOS 0 1 11 [Others] it' s overly alright but i don' t really get along with my father. EOS 0 0 12 Oh i am sorry to hear that.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] don' t worry, it' s okay i am used to it. EOS 0 0 14 Has the Pandemic affected your work life at all?. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] not really i' ve always worked from home. what about you? EOS 0 0 16 Not me so much. Business was slow for quite a while because nobody was really working. But it affected my husband, because everytime anyone in our house got sick he had to leave work becase his work didnt allow anybody to be there if anybody in there household was sick.. So he missed quite a bit of work. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that must have been really terrible, i hope you all are coping with that. how did that make you feel? EOS 0 0 18 It was nerve wracking because you never knew how long he was going to be out of work for. his work changed their policy about when he could come back everytime he was out. EOS 0 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] just from talking to you i can see that it was very stressing for you. is he back to work yet? EOS 0 0 20 oh yes it defintely was. he is out again because I just tested positive for COVID. So he will be out of work for two weeks. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] is there any possibility of him getting a vaccine? he seems to be testing positive fairly often. EOS 0 0 22 He has never tested positive. I tested positive. Just anytime you get any kind of sickness his work makes you take time off just in case you have COVID. He has been tested 3 different times and it has always been negative. EOS 0 1 23 [Others] oh sorry for misunderstanding you. EOS 0 0 24 Thats okay. EOS 0 1 25 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] correct me if i' m wrong but sickness causes you nervousness? EOS 0 0 26 most things cause me nervousness. i am a very anxious person. not sure why.. EOS 0 1 27 [Self-disclosure] i am nervous at times too and i usually try to take a break and do something i find comfort in when i feel like that. i can' t imagine how siffucult must be for you to feel like this often. i' m sure you will be able to find a way to relief your anxiety.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello how are you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I am good, how are you? EOS 3 0 3 I am doing well just dealing with some problems with my friends. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I' m sorry, what type of problems are you having? EOS 3 0 5 Friends not being there for me when I need emotional support. They also do not pay for their stuff when we go out to eat or go to the bar as well. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand, you are having issues with your friends not being there for you emotionally and you are worried about them taking advantage of you when you go out.. EOS 3 0 7 Yes that is exactly it. Just sucks not having that emotional support. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] I completely understand what you are feeling. Have you tried to talk to your friends about your concerns? It helps to clear the air and make sure everyone understands everyone elses perspective. EOS 3 0 9 I have and it seems that they just tell me what I would like to hear! It sucks when I am always there for them when they need me but they cannot do the same. EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have had the same problems in the past with some friends not being there for me when I need it, so I completely understand where you' re coming from.. EOS 3 0 11 It' s good to know that I am not the only one going through this. What is your advice from experience with this? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have anyone else to talk to about what you' re going through? It also helps a lot of the time to talk to an objective 3rd part to help give you some advice on what they think you should do.. EOS 3 0 13 My grandma mostly who is an experienced family therapist but she is going through her own stuff as well. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Another thing that might help is focusing on some of your hobbies, I often find it helpful to use my hobbies to get my mind off of things that are bothering me. EOS 3 0 15 That is definitely helpful. I will look into being more productive and also doing more hobbies around the house to help clear my mind. Any hobbies that you do now that really help? EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I enjoy building model cars in my free time, it really does a good job of keeping me occupied. I also find that reading helps a lot too! EOS 3 0 17 Sounds good to me. I will take up building something... maybe turn it into a business as well. Thank you for the advice. EOS 3 1 18 [Greeting] Not a problem! I am glad I was able to talk to you tonight!
0 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? I am feeling rather sad. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hi there. Yes, What is making you sad? EOS 0 0 2 I feel that my friends do not like me very much any more. Apparently they have been engaging in group activities without me. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities. EOS 0 0 4 Do you think that I am over - reacting? I do not want to sound over sensitive but this has been happening for a while. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you talked with your friends on how you feel? When was the last time you all connected?
3 1 0 [Question] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I' m a little bummed because my friend is not only a junkie but he got arrested last week. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ouch! Your friend got arrested for drugs last week?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hi, how are you feeling today? EOS 3 0 2 I am not feeling the best. I have been having some depression, because of not being able to see friends and family during this pandemic. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Oh, boy, do I know that feeling! How are you dealing with it?( if I may ask) EOS 3 0 4 I try to message them as much as possible and call them on the phone but it is just not the same as actually getting to give the a hug and see them in person. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] I know that. I use Zoom, just to see them... do you have a computer? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. That works for some of my family but I have family in the nursing home that does not have access to computers. I haven' t seen them in several months. It just breaks my heart. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh. I can feel it. I have someone who' s sick as well. Do you have any one friend with whom you can share your feelings, your depression. I understand you' re having issues with depression, right? It sometimes helps me to feel that we' re all in this together. And, at the other end of this, we will be able to give the biggest hugs ever! EOS 3 0 8 Yes. I have some very dear friends that have helped me a lot. I guess the depression is just worse because it is the holidays and this is the first year that I haven' t got to spend it with my extended family members. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Oh.... That' s so tough... it being the first year!!!! Sometimes, I cry( I cry with my cat), and just to say the feelings out loud makes me feel a bit better. EOS 3 0 10 Yeah. I have a little dog that has been my cuddle buddy. I have had him for 13 years so he has seen me ugly cry many times. What are some things you do to deal with depression? EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I try to read, watch programs or podcasts that take away my negativity. Anything that will give me a lift, so that my own depression won' t get so bad that I can' t remember what it felt like to be a bit happy. EOS 3 0 12 That sounds like some good advice. I think I will try to find a good podcast or a good comedy series that I like and spend time doing that. It' s hard to be sad when you are watching something funny or listening to something funny. Thank you for the good advice and the listening ear. EOS 3 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I wish that I could listen to more.... this thing is so slow. Remember, we' re all in this together, and we will come out the other end. Isn' t it OK to be happy a bit, even though this takes such a toll on so many people? EOS 3 0 14 That is so true. I guess we tend to feel guilty if we feel happy since there is so much sadness in the world right now. But you are so right about the fact that we will come out on the other side. It helps to remember that bad things don' t last forever. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, and are you somewhere where you can walk or exercise a bit? I always feel better if I can move around... dance... something active. What I find helps me the most is to remember that we need to stay safe and be OK, so that we will be here to celebrate when this is over. EOS 3 0 16 Yes. I live in the country so I can go for nice walks when the weather is nice. Staying safe is definitely important right now. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh... it' s fortunate that you live in the country. Can you take some deep breathes and watch the trees, the animals, and nature.... they are all here for us??? EOS 3 0 18 Yes that is exactly what I do. Thank you so much for your help today. You have made me feel better just having someone to vent to. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Keep venting, if it makes you feel better. I know I do when I can talk to someone I don' t know. Is it nice where you are today, so that you can look at something bigger than the indoors?? That often helps me feel better. EOS 3 0 20 Yes. It the weather is very pretty here today. As a matter of fact, I think I am fixing to go for a nice walk. I hope you have a wonderful day and thank you for listening. EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You bet, I hope you feel so much better and can take that with you tomorrow - - that you had a good day on the day after Christmas!!!!
4 0 0 I am so embarassed and saddened. I can not believe he cheated on me. I thought we were going to work out. I was really attracted into him and I cared for him a lot. I wanted to date him longer. Thank Goodness I did not sleep with him. What a disaster. Why are men like this? Why do they break women' s hearts? I wish there were more decent men out there that did not play around. Men can be such pigs! EOS 4 1 1 [Question] what happened? EOS 4 0 2 I met a handsome intelligent man. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how are you feeling lately? EOS 4 0 4 We dated for a month. Then out of nowhere he cheated on me. I' m so sad. I am just trying to understand what I did wrong. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s okay. we should learn from things like this.
3 0 0 hello. how are you today? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today?.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 hi. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How are you? EOS 0 0 3 Ive been better. Stressful day. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Ohh.. sorry to hear that. Would you mind sharing what is going on? EOS 0 0 5 Long story short, im a recovering alcoholic, 52 days sober, however my mental health has hit me with vengeance and am really struggling day to day. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You are getting out of alcoholism and feeling bad about it emotionally, is that right? EOS 0 0 7 i used alcohol as a self medication. It helped keep bad symtoms of ADHD away. I miss what alcohol used to do for me. EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I understand you pain and frustration. I have very close friend who has ADHD and trying to cope with it.
3 0 0 hello. anyone there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with today? EOS 3 0 2 am not fine. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What is it that is making you feel this way? EOS 3 0 4 i was cheated on severally, and it resulted me to end the relationship. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you had to deal with a partner recently cheating and a breakup, is this right? EOS 3 0 6 yes thats it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this has been stressful for you and you are trying to figure out how to move on from this. EOS 3 0 8 exactly, i can tend to focus because i have given so much time and affection, i never thought i would be called the fool after everything i did. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is incredibly difficult to get something like this off your mind and it seems like you are trying your best to move forward with your life. EOS 3 0 10 i want to move on but i dont know how, i tried to but i just cant. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I have been through this, I learned how to keep myself busy and do things that I enjoy to occupy my mind and let time heal those wounds. EOS 3 0 12 i think you right, maybe i should renew my netflix sub, since i find great interest in movies so as to get some positive vibes and think less of this whole situation. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Science shows that during a breakup sometimes you romanticize the relationship and view it as better than it actually was and missing something that wasn' t as good as you thought. EOS 3 0 14 yh thats true. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] My suggestion is to focus on new hobbies, spend time with friends and family when possible, if you have work you can do in the mean time, if you like to exercise or go outside, all of this is a helpful tool. EOS 3 0 16 this is really helpful, i really do appreciate this suggestions. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] Don' t be afraid to express your feelings and confide in others about your emotions and mental health. It is still a loss and something you should feel comfortable grieving. EOS 3 0 18 Thanks alot, i feel very relieved talking to you alone, i feel like something negative just left me, i know i will be a better person from this day onward. EOS 3 1 19 [Others] I am glad this was helpful for you and hope you will seek further advice if you feel the need to discuss with someone unbiased.
4 0 0 I just lost my job and am worried about paying the bills. EOS 4 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills. EOS 4 0 2 There is just too much pressure, but I have to succeed. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is hard having so much pressure but I think you will be able to soon get employed again. EOS 4 0 4 I am trying. I' ve started looking online for new positions but it is a process. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise. EOS 4 0 6 I just still am continually nervous and having a hard time coping. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes deep breaths help people calm down. Have you tried that at all? EOS 4 0 8 I haven' t but maybe that will help me stay calmer. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That can sometimes help you to regain your focus and be able to do more for yourself. EOS 4 0 10 That makes sense. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Also, job counselors may help at employment agencies to match you with potential employers. Have you tried any? EOS 4 0 12 I haven' t but that may be helpful as well. EOS 4 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I sought out help from a recruiter online who helped me to find a job as well. Have you heard of that option or tried it? EOS 4 0 14 That might help me to take the stress off myself and get someone to help in the search. EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I see that you seemed to be more relieved finding out these options. Would you say these suggestions have been helpful?
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you feeling? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay. Thank you. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i' m okay too. EOS 0 0 4 Thats good. Do you have plans for the holidays? EOS 0 1 5 [Others] not really, i will probably just relax. what about you? EOS 0 0 6 Just hanging out at home with my husband and son. EOS 0 1 7 [Others] how' s your relationship with your family? EOS 0 0 8 It is pretty good. We all get along good. No issues. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] glad to hear so! EOS 0 0 10 How is your relationship with your family? EOS 0 1 11 [Others] it' s overly alright but i don' t really get along with my father. EOS 0 0 12 Oh i am sorry to hear that.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] don' t worry, it' s okay i am used to it. EOS 0 0 14 Has the Pandemic affected your work life at all?. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] not really i' ve always worked from home. what about you? EOS 0 0 16 Not me so much. Business was slow for quite a while because nobody was really working. But it affected my husband, because everytime anyone in our house got sick he had to leave work becase his work didnt allow anybody to be there if anybody in there household was sick.. So he missed quite a bit of work. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that must have been really terrible, i hope you all are coping with that. how did that make you feel?
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 3 0 2 well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. My life is done now. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband. EOS 3 0 4 well, I cannot say it is a new start when I will be 90 in March. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Then you' ve definitely got a lot going for you if you' re 90! EOS 3 0 6 Had. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Why did he leave you? EOS 3 0 8 He wanted a younger woman. His new girlfriend is 63. He is 45. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that is more of his problem then. You deserve someone that' s better than leaving someone because of their age. EOS 3 0 10 I thought it would be nice to have a younger man when we got married. He eventually told me he just married me for my money, and was waiting for me to pass so he could inherit all of it. He said he got tired of waiting, so he moved on to someone else. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Personally, if that' s how he felt, then you' re better off. I know that doesn' t stop the hurt you' re feeling, but you are worth more than that. EOS 3 0 12 Now I am here alone. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being single does not mean you' re completely alone. There are a lot of resources to talk to someone and make friends. EOS 3 0 14 I am looking on Tinder for a new friend, but nobody wants someone that is 90. I never used it before, but someone told me about it. Considering I haven' t dated in 25 years. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could you try something like Facebook or Instagram to connect with old friends or acquaintances? EOS 3 0 16 What are those? I heard of them, but never used them. Most of my old friends are no longer around... EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Social networks online, you can connect with family or old coworkers. And post pictures and see what other people are doing with their lives. EOS 3 0 18 I am looking for something quicker, I don' t know how much longer I have. I can' t be spending months waiting for the right person. EOS 3 1 19 [Question] So you' re looking for a strictly romantic relationship? EOS 3 0 20 well.... someone to spend time with. My great grandson said people meet others on Tinder now. Told me I should try it. Have you heard of it or used it? EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Can you go to the park? Maybe visit there to meet new people? EOS 3 0 22 Possibly. My cats don' t like to have a leash on them though. EOS 3 1 23 [Others] I' ve never used it, not sure if Tinder is the right place to meet someone to spend time with. Not always the best intentions. EOS 3 0 24 why? EOS 3 1 25 [Others] People are not always who they say they are. EOS 3 0 26 oh that' s scary... and dangerous. Thank you for telling me that. I will have a talk with my great grandson. I am going to try the park. There have been some cute gentlemen feeding the birds there. Maybe they want to talk. Thank you for the help. EOS 3 1 27 [Others] That' s a great idea, everyone loves feeding birds! Glad we were able to chat.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all. EOS 0 0 45 Also being far away from him sucks. EOS 0 1 46 [Question] Are you guys FaceTiming or communicating at all other than by texts? EOS 0 0 47 You are being very helpful by the way thank you. We aren' t FaceTiming. I just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it.. EOS 0 1 48 [Greeting] I' m trying my best, thank you for the input! Upset about leaving the apartment? Or was there something else that happened that weekend? EOS 0 0 49 Just leaving him. EOS 0 1 50 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you guys thought about scheduling date nights through FaceTime? EOS 0 0 51 I think he would but he hasn' t been feeling really good about his appearance lately. I asked and that' s what he told me. EOS 0 1 52 [Self-disclosure] I understand that completely, I can relate a lot. EOS 0 0 53 Same. EOS 0 1 54 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If it makes any difference, my partner and I have been doing date nights where we would dress up, put make up on and do our hair and everything as if we were going to the restaurant, and even if it is through Facetime or whenever we see each other in real life, it helps not only with our own self - esteem but also our relationship. EOS 0 0 55 That is very cute. EOS 0 1 56 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could open the discussion with your boyfriend, tell him that you have a date planned over Facetime and you want him to order his favorite dinner, take a shower, do his hair and dress up real nice. EOS 0 0 57 I don' t know if he would be open to that but I could try. He isn' t really the romantic type. EOS 0 1 58 [Question] You have been friends for a long time before getting together, you guys are comfortable with each other, right? EOS 0 0 59 Yes. EOS 0 1 60 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay well you do know him more than I do haha, so what would be his ideal date night? EOS 0 0 61 Probably just being at home. EOS 0 1 62 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hm okay, well I' m sure that if you do propose and organize something for him, even if it is not his favorite thing to do, if he sees that it would make you happy, he will at least consider it don' t you think? EOS 0 0 63 Yeah probably. Things are hard right now though. EOS 0 1 64 [Question] In other ways than financially? EOS 0 0 65 The financial things make things emotionally hard. I am one of the only people he has in his corner right now. EOS 0 1 66 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I' m sorry to hear that... it must be difficult for you to be in this position, I understand the stress and pressure. Is the pandemic the reason he is having also financial difficulties at the moment? EOS 0 0 67 Yes sort of. He was let go cause of covid. EOS 0 1 68 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that. Has he also been in the search for another job? EOS 0 0 69 Yes he' s trying unemployment. EOS 0 1 70 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m confused he isn' t trying to find a job? EOS 0 0 71 Unemployment helps you find jobs and pays you while you do it here. EOS 0 1 72 [Greeting] Oh okay I didn' t know that thanks!

EOS 1 0 7 Yes, and I have gotten my son to go to a therapist weekly to try to express his anger about the pandemic and the changes it has brought in his lifestyle. He cannot take his frustrustations out on us. EOS 1 1 8 [Question] How long has this been going on? Is the therapist working for him? EOS 1 0 9 He came back last March for what we thought at the time would be a month or two. EOS 1 1 10 [Question] Have you had a conversation with your son about the way he is acting? EOS 1 0 11 He is difficult to get through to. He seems to have traded midwestern charm for NYC bullying. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe he should start seeing a therapist every day maybe that will help. EOS 1 0 13 I am not sure that he can afford that, but I have seen small changes in his behavior since he started seeing her. I want him to stop seeing my boyfriend as the enemy. EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe your boyfriend and your son needs to sit down and have a talk. EOS 1 0 15 That may work with a therapist. I have tried to mediate and both were terribly bull headed and argumentative. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] or you know your boyfriend can plan out a day or something and your son and your boyfriend can go out and do something fun. EOS 1 0 17 I am a quiet person and I want a happy household.. EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] They should have a talk because communication is key and that will solve a lot.

They also do not pay for their stuff when we go out to eat or go to the bar as well.

EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck. EOS 0 0 7 How did you push past that job? EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work. EOS 0 0 9 Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career? EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too. EOS 0 0 11 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Can you give me some more details? EOS 0 0 13 I just find the work mundane and way too remedial. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable. EOS 0 0 15 did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job? EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have you a few, there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit. EOS 0 0 17 what types of skill can I gain online? EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Indeed is one of the better ones to look for jobs, honestly I would suggest looking at jobs that you normally wouldn' t and see what kind of qualifications they need and see if you can get that done online.

I have had that one recommended to me before, they said its a great way to neatly organize accomplishments and personal background. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes especially if you are applying for anything in a professional setting that is very important. EOS 0 0 25 do you have any examples of online skills you completed? EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] coursera has a lot of great courses, it really depends on what you are looking for. EOS 0 0 27 if I was looking to enter the engineering field, any recommendations? EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Is that what you are going to school for?
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay just anxious. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that' s bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I believe i am going to fail all my finals for college. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] College finals are a stressful time for sure, I' m sure you' re doing your best to prepare. EOS 0 0 6 Yes i have been studying for hours everyday. sometimes it is hard to focus. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s best to take a short break to reset when you feel like your gears are grinding. EOS 0 0 8 that is true, but i feel guilty when i take breaks. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I often feel the same way when I' m not busy doing work. But sometimes you need that little break to get back into the zone and be more productive. EOS 0 0 10 I try to take multiple 5 min breaks throughout my studying but it usually turns into hours breaks lol. its hard to focus. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You sounds pretty stressed about it, make sure you' re getting enough sleep so you don' t get run down. EOS 0 0 12 Yes i. do sleep for at least 10 hours. i also take 20 minute power naps because i have read somewhere it helps. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there someone you could study with to help break up how you' re studying? EOS 0 0 14 yes i live with a roommate and we are in the same program, but i sometimes feel dumb when i study with her. EOS 0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Try not to think of yourself that way. I' m sure you both provide a benefit to each other while studying. EOS 0 0 16 it is fun when we study together,. i also forget to eat sometimes because im so stressed. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I also felt that way around finals and with friends, I think it' s important to recognize this is one semester and that it' s equally as important to take care of yourself as it is to pass those finals.
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 3 0 2 Not feeling good. Trying to find a job but no success. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] It' s a really hard time to be finding new work isn' t it? Are you getting unemployment or anything? EOS 3 0 4 I am getting unemployment but that is not sufficient with 6 children. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wow that' s a lot of kids. Do you know that there are foodbanks out there which might be able to help you? EOS 3 0 6 As a single mother It' s pretty hard to go to search for food bank. I am spending most of my time in looking for a job. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are there any organisations that you could just call and explain your predicament to?
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless.

EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long!
3 0 0 I am so stressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi, what' s going on? EOS 3 0 2 I have a college course in the evening, but I cannot concentrate while distance learning. I am expected to watch the instructor do excel on a tiny phone screen and follow along. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oooff that sounds brutal... especially the excel part! do you have a bigger screen you can use? EOS 3 0 4 It is stressful. I am able to pull up zoom on my laptop, but it is almost more cumbersome because I must switch back and forth. I have to also manipulate an excel as well as watch the instructor. My colleagues in the class are annoying, because they do not know how to use mute correctly. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have access to a second screen or have the ability to stream the class on your tv through chromecast or something? EOS 3 0 6 I don' t have a second screen, but I do have a large TV. I may be able to hook it up via HDMI. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The mute thing is horrible. I have no ideas for that. hahah. I' m looking for help with that too! Yeah try the HDMI hook up you can sometimes find cheap attachements on amazon if you don' t have the right connections. EOS 3 0 8 Sometimes I get really anxious. My ears will be pounding and I feel like I can' t hear anything. It is worse when using in ears, because it' s like all I can hear is my heartbeat. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yeah if you stream it on your tv, you won' t have to wear headphones... that way you can control the volume better too. EOS 3 0 10 That sounds like a great idea. Have you had any weird technological solutions to help you through distance learning? EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' m not really doing any distance learning right now. Just working from home and coincidentally most of my work uses excel. I have constant virtual meetings where I have to show people things via excel. It' s pretty tough but I found if I use multiple monitors it makes things easier. EOS 3 0 12 I have considered making impulse buys to help with some things. Do you know about portable second monitor screens for laptops? It seems almost like a thin tablet that you plug in to your laptop. I like the idea. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] my second monitor is not portable. I don' t know if that would work for me because I work better in one designated spot. So I have 3 monitors on my desk( 2 separate monitors and my laptop screen). however something like That would definitely be something I' d look into if I was in school or taking classes.
5 1 0 [Question] Hi there. How are you today? EOS 5 0 1 I' m good. how r u? EOS 5 1 2 [Question] I' m doing good today. What brings you on here? EOS 5 0 3 I' m not happy with an ex friend who talks behind my back to my current friends. EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] ugh. There' s nothing worse than that. Have you confronted the ex friend? EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking. EOS 5 1 6 [Question] oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it? EOS 5 0 7 they' re still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander. EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s an option but I hope it doesn' t go that far again. Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 4 1 2 [Greeting] I am good how are you. EOS 4 0 3 I am glad you are doing well, I have been struggling lately as my girlfriend that I was going to propose to broke up with me. She told me that my career path was different then hers and she just did not see it working out. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] How was your career path different? I understand how you are feeling everything will be okay. EOS 4 0 5 She had a desire to do marine biology and I wanted to pursue law enforcement as a police officer, however due to my back injury that fell through recently. She would spend most of her time doing field work, which would require her to spend time out at sea. She was working in a nursing home at the time and was not a marine biologist.. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] She did not like your career path? EOS 4 0 7 I am thinking that would be the case, however we dated for 3 years and then reconnecting about a year later which at this time was a distant relationship. She now has a boyfriend which she started date about 2 months she broke up with me. I found out that he works with her at the nursing home. I am unsure what to think, but she did say that she just didn' t see how our career paths would work out and that was that.. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right. It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after. EOS 4 0 9 I have had some friends echo that. I agree, it definitely felt like I was giving a lot through the time we dated. I have always wondered if this was a true statement, knowing her I think she probably got scared of what that entailed or just the distance. The new boyfriend was definitely a wild card, that I think has caused me to question her parting words. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don' t support your career. I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self. EOS 4 0 11 I appreciate your feedback on this,( this event for context occurred about a year ago and I have moved on from it) my support system has said the same thing. I think the difficult part is just overcoming that mental/ emotional hurdle of having the desire to marry her, which failed since it was an expectation of what was to come. I appreciate your suggestions. I think being the best" me" will help equip me for my future spouse!:). EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Right i can understand how you are feeling. We all have been in a situation where we have the desire to marry someone and all that fails. I have been in a situation like that.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am very sorry to hear that. What are you sad about? EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently? EOS 4 0 5 It is over permanently... EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah I guess, the relationship was a little toxic and she sometimes only used me for money. Maybe is it for the best now that I think about it. EOS 4 1 8 [Others] Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!! EOS 4 0 9 Yeah I just miss having someone there for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] All you need now is to give yourself some TLC.. treat yourself to something nice and go easy on yourself. EOS 4 0 11 What is TLC. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] There will be someone else. I never thought I' d find anyone else but I did and we' ve been together ten years ago now! Tender Loving Care:) Means be good to yourself.

4 0 0 I am so embarassed and saddened. I can not believe he cheated on me. I thought we were going to work out. I was really attracted into him and I cared for him a lot. I wanted to date him longer. Thank Goodness I did not sleep with him. What a disaster. Why are men like this? Why do they break women' s hearts? I wish there were more decent men out there that did not play around. Men can be such pigs! EOS 4 1 1 [Question] what happened? EOS 4 0 2 I met a handsome intelligent man. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how are you feeling lately? EOS 4 0 4 We dated for a month. Then out of nowhere he cheated on me. I' m so sad. I am just trying to understand what I did wrong. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s okay. we should learn from things like this. EOS 4 0 6 That' s true. It' s crazy we have to experience heart ache. To learn... EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] don' t think much and keep yourself engaged in the activities you like the most. EOS 4 0 8 Hey, that is great advice! EOS 4 1 9 [Question] can you tell me how are you before this incident? EOS 4 0 10 I was happy. But when a man breaks your heart, it makes you feel very ugly.

4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling pretty good right now.. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk to me about? EOS 4 0 3 I have a friend who knew me since I was little. She is a little older than me. She still treat me like I' m still little. I tried to explain to her that I' m a grown woman and I grew out of lot of things when I was a kid.. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Is she listening to you? I know how it feels to be patronised by people who are older. EOS 4 0 5 She still didn' t get it. I want our relationship to move further but with her like this. I feel sad. Is there anything I can do? EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Well, if she is not listening to you when you try to talk to her you have to ask yourself whether the relationship is really worth it? EOS 4 0 7 That' s true. I didn' t think about it. Should I approach her and talk about it before? EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I think it' s always worth fighting for a friendship but there does come a point when it stops being at all viable. EOS 4 0 9 Yeah, that' s definitely true. I know she is a good person. So I would give her a chance and we can talk about it before. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Does she have younger siblings? I am the eldest of four and I sometimes, even at age forty five, find myself trying to tell them what to do. EOS 4 0 11 She have a younger brother that is 9 years younger. She used to be only child for a while before her brother was born.. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It could be the cause of her behaviour. EOS 4 0 13 Maybe that' s why. She have different personality than me. She is more into logical thinking and she love people and has bubbly personality. While I' m emotional but are social butterfly and after a while, I would need a break from people.. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] How much would it hurt you to end the friendship? Do you think you could make other friends and survive it or is it worth fighting for? EOS 4 0 15 To be honest, there are some times when she made me cry or mad when I get home. I think that over the time and the more older I get, the more I would knowledge my relationship with her.. EOS 4 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] I know that I don' t know her but to be honest it does sound to me like your friendship is a bit toxic.. EOS 4 0 17 I do have other friends that I could purse the relationship farther. I think I just felt bad that I known her for years and she is a good person. It' s just not what I need right now.. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes we really just have to let things go. I know it' s hard but it will probably good for your mental health. I hope that I have been able to help you today! It' s a difficult situation for sure.

EOS 0 0 6 We went out for coffee the other day and I thought about saying something cos I know they went to a club without me last weekend but I couldn' t bring myself to in the end. EOS 0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand it is tough to bring up what is bothering you, especially after getting to hang out with all your friend over coffee. I' m sure this was not intentional with not inviting you to the club. EOS 0 0 8 Sometimes in the past I have turned down invitations to go out clubbing, admittedly. Could it be that they just did not think that I wanted to go?. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] From what I have experienced personally, I am not a fan of clubs and didnt want to go with my friends. After turning them down a few times, they stopped inviting as well. I think they thought that was not my thing.

EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I can relate to you in this situation 100% and if it wasnt for me stepping out on faith and opening my own practice, I wouldnt be here now. EOS 3 0 10 How did you snap out of the situation, did you have some savings? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Always putting money aside when able, and doing lots of research about first time businesses gave a lot of insights. Have you tried to look into things like that yourself? EOS 3 0 12 Yes, i have been researching a lot too but it is difficult given that i have been surviving on the savings i had. Also it is very difficult to get a loan currently. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] That I do understand as well. This pandemic has made it hard for everyone. Are you a parent with any little ones by chance? EOS 3 0 14 Yes, i have two children, 5 and 9 year olds. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] So here is some information that I have in my files to help others during this time. There is self - help. org that is labeled as being a self help during these times.

Also try to google" How to become a first time business owner" and see if any of this information helps you and your family.. EOS 3 0 16 That is very helpful of you. I have been wandering all over the internet lost and not knowing where to find help from. I will definitely check this out and make good use of them. Did you also get any funds from anyone? EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know that it can be hard and frustrating during this time, but you have to remain focused for your family and stay strong because I am sure they look up to you. With myself I did have to go to a lot of friends and family, but my faith and my blessings came from God. Looking to him to help with your problems and actually listening to his words would really alleviate some of the stress that is so draining. EOS 3 0 18 I agree that God is our ultimate guide and helper in all this. He will never forsake us no matter what. I will definitely turn to him at this time to seek for his guidance and with faith He will see me through. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Just keep your eyes on the prize because this means that HE has something bigger in store for you!

EOS 1 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that i can understand how you must be feeling. Why does your son not like your boyfriend? EOS 1 0 3 He is going back to school and I am supporting him in that. The problem is that my boyfriend thinks my son should speak to me more respectfully.

6 0 0 Hello, how are you?. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 6 0 2 I' m alright, honestly I' m feeling rather ashamed. The reason for that and the problem that I' m facing is that I' ve had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and I' m only 24 years old. Right now in my life I' m ready to seek help, but I' m having a lot of anxiety about it because I' m very worried about how others will judge me. I' m worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that I will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. I' m ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that I' ve made that have gotten me here and I guess my problem is that I just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that I can just finally make the step that I need so desperately and get help. EOS 6 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am in a good position to help you as I am in the same situation. Please know you are not alone. I would definitely recommend seeking help sooner rather than later! Hello? Are you wanting to talk? EOS 6 0 4 Yes of course I didn' t hear it go off, my apologies. I really appreciate that, it really is helpful knowing that I' m not the only one who feels this way. I really know that that' s what I need to do, and I am trying my best to get over my fears and just do it ya know. EOS 6 1 5 [Question] What level of alcohol consumption do you have? EOS 6 0 6 no matter how hard it seems, maybe it wont be when I actual do it. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Trust me everyone will be very sympathetic:). Everyone there will be in the same place. And the longer you keep drinking the more damage you are doing to yourself. EOS 6 0 8 and quite a bit, about half a gallon or more a day. And thank you, I really do appreciate your help. I know that and I know its time for me to better my life because its no way to live ya know. Id like to grow up and have a normal life(:. EOS 6 1 9 [Others] I am not sure how much half a gallon is to you... I am in the UK and I know it differs between the US and UK:) EOS 6 0 10 thank you, i do feel better about going now. I just dont know what to expect and it can be scary sometimes. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You will be treated with respect at all times. You might even find that you make some new friends:) Ping:) EOS 6 0 12 You' re right, and that' s what I probably need also is some friends who are in similar positions. EOS 6 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' d recommend online message boards. EOS 6 0 14 They' d understand my situation more, and be good influences.

4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi like I said a bit down. EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I did not see that, I am sorry. Do you want to talk about it? It might help.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 hi. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How are you?
4 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 4 0 2 I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age? EOS 4 0 4 He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough, both for you and him. I know it' s meaningless to tell you not to be sad, however, you can think that he' s not in a better place. EOS 4 0 6 I presume you mean now and not not;). Though I simply am not a believer. It just made me think how meaningless life was.. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn' t it? I sometimes think it' s meaningless too.
0 0 0 hi there. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m surviving. Today is better than yesterday was. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. What is bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I' ve been out of work since Covid closed down the live event industry in March. the unemployment system still hasn' t processed any of my claims, and I have been surviving off of what I can make driving for doordash, which hasn' t been a lot. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough. The unemployment system has been very slow during COVID, so I completely understand your frustration and worry. I am glad to hear that you are doing door dash, even if you aren' t making a lot that is still something!
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 2 Feeling depressed as usual. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 4 Everything. Life. It' s awful. How many years do you really need to stop enjoying this place. Ya know what I mean. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand, but just to make sure I know what is going on fully, you are depressed in general and don' t know how to get through it.. EOS 3 0 6 I would say that is fairly accurate. Often times, I wish an asteroid would come down and begin the apocolypse.. Something to break up the routine. Don' t you find life utterly boring and repetitive?. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Just from these few messages, I can tell you are extremely upset about this.. I have had problems in the past with depression as well, I used to have severe anxiety as well.. EOS 3 0 8 Sorry to hear that. Anxiety and depression are dual bladed sword of badness. Really bad mixture. I never struggled too much with anxiety.. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It was tough. Have you thought about consulting a psychological professional to help with this issue? I did when I was going through my depression and it really helped.. EOS 3 0 10 NO! I would never do that. I' m already on anti depressants. That didn' t help at all.. I just don' t understand why people like life enough to make more people! It is madness! EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I didn' t like the meds that they gave me either, however I felt that talking to someone helped me a great deal.. EOS 3 0 12 Well, I' m glad it helped you. I' m not just saying that. Being depressed is awful.. What did it do for you? How so? EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] It was good to be able to talk to an objective third party about what was going on. It allowed me to get my feelings out without the threat of being judges or harrassed.. EOS 3 0 14 I understand. Well, I appreciate your time and advice. I just don' t feel like you and I are understanding each other very well, though. Anyway, you made your bonus. I appreciate you trying to help me, though. We got to talk for another 4 minutes though. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to focus on more of your hobbies in order to get your mind off of things? EOS 3 0 16 I used to have more hobbies. Now, I' m not so motivated to do much of anything anymore. I used to play instruments. I like hiking a little, but it is winter now. So... I can' t even do that. Plus... I have to travel really far to do that because there is nothing to hike that is very close. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Why did you stop playing insturments?
4 0 0 hi. hello!!??!!?? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] hello. EOS 4 0 2 hi. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I apologize I was having a sneezing fit! What is on your mind today? EOS 4 0 4 oh no. i hope its not covid!. my friends aunt is in the hospital with double pneumonia from covid. EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] No, cats and out of claritin. oh my, that is horrible! EOS 4 0 6 i hear ya. just bought some claritin this morning for allergies. I agree. at least she is responding to the treatments in the hospital. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That' s great to hear she is responding! EOS 4 0 8 I was happy to hear it too. I' ve been extra careful not to get it cuz of my parents. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] ah, are they elderly or have a weakened immune system? EOS 4 0 10 elderly. dads doctor told me not to meet friends in person cuz i could pass it onto him. EOS 4 1 11 [Others] gotcha. you must live with them to help them out! EOS 4 0 12 i sure do. thing is people my age are getting very sick with it too. and some elderly are not. so i could be helping myself more than my dad. EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] mine are in another state so i don' t have to worry about my behavior. you are right though, anyone can get it... i should probably be more careful myself.
4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 i feel depresed. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Why do you feel depressed? EOS 4 0 3 breakup with my partner. EOS 4 1 4 [Others] Breakups can be really tough. How long were you with your partner? EOS 4 0 5 3years of time we have been in love. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I once had a relationship end after 5 years with a partner. Staying active really helped me get over the relationship. Through that activity I actually met my new partner! EOS 4 0 7 but i love my partner so much that i couldnt forget her right now. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about doing something fun, like taking a trip somewhere? EOS 4 0 9 yeah we went for trip we had a god relationship. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really difficult, but I know you can get through this! What do you like to do for fun? EOS 4 0 11 we had enjoyment and romance. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about fun activities you did without your partner? EOS 4 0 13 none i love her so much so i have not done anything without her. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] What about before you met her? EOS 4 0 15 i was doing good. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] What did you do for fun before you met her?
0 0 0 Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, what seems to be on your mind?. EOS 0 0 2 Friends and our relationships amongst one another. Two are arguing and I want to help both. We only can facetime each other because of Corona and it is taking a toll among our group. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I see. How long have your two friends been arguing?
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Same old.. still trying to lose weight. Already on day 20 for fasting. did not lose a single pound. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight. What kind of methods have you been using?
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work. EOS 4 0 14 Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn' t even want me to help her, no she doesn' t work. EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family. EOS 4 0 16 Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] How long has it been since she moved in. EOS 4 0 18 A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you thought about a housewarming gift. EOS 4 0 20 Hmm, no I didn' t think about that, that may be a good idea. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So just a week and she is settling in. EOS 4 0 22 Yes, but the home came furnished and honestly, I didn' t think there was that much to do, but maybe I should get a gift, to break the ice. EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Friendship is important maybe she needs to hear from you. EOS 4 0 24 Yes, it is very important, I just felt if I called I would be bothering her:( EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style. EOS 4 0 26 That is possible, and it is a HUGE house, 4 stories. EOS 4 1 27 [Question] Have you tried to visit her and see if you can help.
3 1 0 [Question] Good day, how are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 Not too well. I have been depessed because of our state shut down and today an old friend from unior high school passed. EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that. I absolutely understand, it' s been hard on most people having to deal with the current state of affairs and losing people.. Do you think things will improve? EOS 3 0 3 Thank you. I know we are all in the same predicament.. I think things will improve, but not for a year or more.. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I agree. I lost a teacher some time ago and I' ve been thinking a lot about when things might improve. A year seems plausible. Since it' s so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up? EOS 3 0 5 A year is a long time when y. A year is a long time when you are 76 years old. I just want to enjoy the rest of our lives - my husband and me - and travel until we can' t enjoy it any longer. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that. It is really tough being restricted to not travelling. I call my parents( around your age) about once a week. EOS 3 0 7 Thank you so much for your support. It is tough and there is nothing to do. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have family you can talk to? Have you considered volunteering? I ask because my neighbor bakes for the local food bank and it helps her. EOS 3 0 9 Yes, I do, but I can' t talk to my son in Florida because he lost his job and havng tough time. I don' t feel like I should enjoy my life when he is suffering. We may need to help him financially. I use to volunteer at a nursing home, but I am afraid to now with the virus. EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is reasonable. And it sounds like you are doing all you can. Could you teach from home online and keep yourself safe? Or perhaps provide your son financial support? EOS 3 0 11 I am trying to do what I can for my son and also to help so I don' t get too down and depressed. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are doing everything you can. Some things are just beyond our control. And we are all struggling, so please know you are not alone in your feelings.
1 0 0 I' m qualified for a promotion but my boss is refusing to promote me based on biased feedback he has received from someone else. EOS 1 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn' t willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right? EOS 1 0 2 Yes that' s right. It' s frustratgn.* frustrating. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co - worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective. EOS 1 0 4 Unfortunately I can' t really talk to anyone at work because there is no one I trust to this extent. Promotions are a bit of a sensitive issue. EOS 1 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you reported to your HR department the issue around biased feedback being used as a determining factor in not being considered? EOS 1 0 6 The HR department favours managers so I am worried that will damage my chances of promotion further. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry you have to deal with this at work. I think you deserve the promotion because you are very dedicated.
0 0 0 Hello my situation is that I' m facing an enormous amount of academic pressure. EOS 0 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello. Academic work can be overwhelming at times. I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though. Could you tell me what the issue is in particular? EOS 0 0 2 It' s just a huge amount of work that I' m struggling with and a ton of exams and they give me a lot of anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming. Make sure that you try to be as prepared as you can. When you feel capable of doing well on said exams, you will feel a lot less pressure. EOS 0 0 4 Do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though? EOS 0 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have an academic councelor you can talk to? EOS 0 0 6 yes it' s all virtual though. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well at least is something. I am sure talking to someone who might be able to guide you academically will be a significant relief.. EOS 0 0 8 That is a good idea. Do you personally recommend anything on how to balance my schedule and still be able to have my time to do other things? EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] When I was at college, I usually aimed at 2 hours of studying everyday(+ homework) and I also aimed to have at least 2 hours of leisure time. EOS 0 0 10 I see, and how were you able to maintain a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep and healthy eating habits during college? EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I honestly didn' t eat very healthy. If you live with your parents, I think a proper nutrition is easier. I usually slept around 7 hours each night. I picked most of my classes on the afternoon, worked out in the mornings. EOS 0 0 12 okay i understand, and what do you suggest for when you do poorly on an exam that you studied so hard for, how do you keep yourself from feeling down? EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest talking to the professor or an academic advisor to explore strategies that could help you improve. EOS 0 0 14 okay but is it normal to be upset? EOS 0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course, it is normal to feel upset. However, you should not blame yourself. No one is perfect. EOS 0 0 16 Okay that makes me feel better. EOS 0 1 17 [Question] I am glad it does: D! Anything else I can help you with today? EOS 0 0 18 that' s it! thank you for your help. EOS 0 1 19 [Greeting] You are very welcome!
6 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there! How may I support you? EOS 6 0 2 Well, I' m really upset with my friends. EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I am so sorry to hear that. Did something happen? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, they aren' t taking COVID seriously. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns? EOS 6 0 6 Yes but they get angry with me. I don' t know how to get through to them, EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It' s also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right. EOS 6 0 8 I really don' t know I just haven' t been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out. It' s a weird dynamic. EOS 6 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you' re finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it' s the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right?
0 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hai. EOS 0 0 1 Hey. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How are you friend? Where are you from? EOS 0 0 3 Okay i guess. North Carolina. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] ok, EOS 0 0 5 What about you? EOS 0 1 6 [Question] What are you doing? i am john from, new york. EOS 0 0 7 Watching tom and jerry with my kids. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] oh nice. EOS 0 0 9 What you doing? EOS 0 1 10 [Question] tell about you? just i chating. what your good name? EOS 0 0 11 Im 28. A mother of two who just moved after my marriage fell apart. I enjoy cartoons, reading, gaming, and listening to music and audiobooks. EOS 0 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] wow good job.. EOS 0 0 13 Lol. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] anything else?
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing? EOS 6 0 1 I' m doing okay.. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you want to talk about? EOS 6 0 3 I' m having problems with getting up everyday and doing my daily routine. I feel bad because these are things that other people do normally. EOS 6 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah, I' ve definitely felt that way... especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day?
0 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? I am feeling rather sad. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hi there. Yes, What is making you sad? EOS 0 0 2 I feel that my friends do not like me very much any more. Apparently they have been engaging in group activities without me. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities. EOS 0 0 4 Do you think that I am over - reacting? I do not want to sound over sensitive but this has been happening for a while. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you talked with your friends on how you feel? When was the last time you all connected? EOS 0 0 6 We went out for coffee the other day and I thought about saying something cos I know they went to a club without me last weekend but I couldn' t bring myself to in the end. EOS 0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand it is tough to bring up what is bothering you, especially after getting to hang out with all your friend over coffee. I' m sure this was not intentional with not inviting you to the club. EOS 0 0 8 Sometimes in the past I have turned down invitations to go out clubbing, admittedly. Could it be that they just did not think that I wanted to go?. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] From what I have experienced personally, I am not a fan of clubs and didnt want to go with my friends. After turning them down a few times, they stopped inviting as well. I think they thought that was not my thing. EOS 0 0 10 The thing is though that this is not the only thing - they have been to rock concerts without me too. I just feel I am no longer a part of the group. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I feel how this is hurting you. The best thing would be to talk to them about feeling disinvited to group activities. Let them know you are still free and really want to spend some time together. Do you think you can open up to them on whats bothering you? EOS 0 0 12 I don' t know. I don' t want to come across as just being paranoid or whiny. Sometimes I think it would be better to just forget them and not have any friends. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like this situation is really bothering you. Its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated. The bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation. If they don' t know what is bothering you, it will be harder to mend the relationship.

4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one. EOS 4 0 16 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. What else can I do besides meditation? EOS 4 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds? EOS 4 0 18 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. Candles are much better for me. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil. EOS 4 0 20 I haven' t heard of that website before. I' ll have to check it out. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships. EOS 4 0 22 Well, I haven' t been in a long - term relationship like this before.. My past relationships were all in high school, and they only lasted a few weeks or months at a time. I really cared for this one, and we were together for so long. EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] I feel obligated to help during Christmas because I had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts. EOS 4 0 24 You had a fight with your partner? I' m sorry, it' s the worst when people fight over what' s supposed to be something nice. EOS 4 1 25 [Question] What was the fight over? Food? Money? Sex? EOS 4 0 26 I forget what started it, it was something stupid. He didn' t like the way I said something and it kind of blew up from there. We were fighting over the smallest things these last few months. It just kind of built up to the point where he said he couldn' t take fighting with me anymore and just wanted to end it. EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would let things decompress for a long while. EOS 4 0 28 End the relationship, I mean. You think maybe if we just take some time apart, he might want to talk about it? EOS 4 1 29 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest thinking through ending the relationship if he has a hot temper.. EOS 4 0 30 He does get upset very easily. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, just think it through for some time.. EOS 4 0 32 I do think it is important to take some time and breathe. EOS 4 1 33 [Question] Was the relationship with him pleasant for many months? EOS 4 0 34 Yes, for most of our time together it was wonderful. He made me laugh very easily. That' s part of why I' m so sad that he ended the relationship. EOS 4 1 35 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said it has only gotten rough in the last two months? EOS 4 0 36 Two or three, yes. And we would fight over the smallest things, it was really stupid. EOS 4 1 37 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that he has announced to you he has ended the relationship on Christmas? Today, you mean?
5 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling today? EOS 5 0 1 uninspired. broken. a rock. a static object. bananas. EOS 5 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, that' s a start. Do I hear you saying that you' re confused at the moment? EOS 5 0 3 not confused. frustrated that I have to produce art for marks when I am not inspired. EOS 5 1 4 [Question] Ah I hear you, education can be both wonderful and difficult can' t it? What are you supposed to produce? EOS 5 0 5 painting after painting. like I am an ikea machine, photocopying picasos for A' s. EOS 5 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that that is very frustrating. Would you consider switching majors? EOS 5 0 7 What is life but a stage. Art is life. I love art.. no. EOS 5 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass. Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of your future and one day it will pay off? EOS 5 0 9 does the sun now set and then rise again. Does the spring not come after winter. Yet I cannot see how art will give me grades. EOS 5 1 10 [Question] Well, I am assuming that you want to go into an artistic field on graduation?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability. EOS 3 0 21 i applied for disability but didn' t get it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself. EOS 3 0 23 yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn' t matter. EOS 3 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Social Security stopped you. Why? EOS 3 0 25 i' m not injured enough for them. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can file against the company if you can prove neglect in the employer.. Were there proper safety guards. EOS 3 0 27 I tried but since it is the state of PA they have immunity. no. EOS 3 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was a state injury, there must be an avenue you can use to prove neglect. EOS 3 0 29 I was told that I assumed the risk of injury working for them. It was a mental hospital. EOS 3 1 30 [Question] have you contacted OSHA and filed a complaint with them? EOS 3 0 31 not yet. I should. EOS 3 1 32 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There should be an avenue for you to seek compensation. EOS 3 0 33 The lawyer fought with them for over a year. There was even an appeal but I lost that too. EOS 3 1 34 [Reflection of feelings] It is unfortunate that safety is not a factor. It was a state hospital? EOS 3 0 35 yes. EOS 3 1 36 [Question] Did a patient attack you? EOS 3 0 37 yes. EOS 3 1 38 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There must be liability concerning your injury. EOS 3 0 39 I can' t go after the patient because they are mentally incompetent so I' m out of ideas. EOS 3 1 40 [Question] But what about the family? EOS 3 0 41 I don' t know if the person had one anymore. EOS 3 1 42 [Question] Is the patient a ward of the state. EOS 3 0 43 yes. EOS 3 1 44 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So the patient' s family either gave the person up or the patient was placed there by the state right? EOS 3 0 45 he was placed there by the court after committing a crime. EOS 3 1 46 [Affirmation and Reassurance] . Then he must be a threat to other people. It seems the state should be held liable for negligence. EOS 3 0 47 Oh I agree. There were many dangerous patients there and no recourse for the staff. I was injured 5 times in the years I worked there. This last one was the end for me. I couldn' t work anymore due to pain. EOS 3 1 48 [Question] Can you work from home for yourself? EOS 3 0 49 I have been applying for those kind of jobs but haven' t had any luck yet. EOS 3 1 50 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are companies hiring.
0 1 0 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hello, How are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 am fine. at least for now. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] would you like to talk about it? EOS 0 0 3 yeah... i have not been able to meet with my boyfriend physically due to the corona lockdown, and when i finally got to see him last month i discovered that he is cheating on me. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am so sorry that you had to go through that, I know this is a very difficult time for you. Has your boyfriend reached out to you at all to clarify things or to see if you are okay? EOS 0 0 5 he has but it is not sounding convincing enough. i feel so hurt. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Just By chatting with you, I can feel how hurt and upset you are. Is there anyone that can provide you support at home during this time? EOS 0 0 7 there is nobody i can talk to about this, i dont really have friends and my siblings are busy with their lives. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] This is a very challenging time for you especially when there is lack of support. I do feel your pain, And I would like to share some advise and suggestions which may alleviate some of the hurt and pain you are going through. Would you e open to hear them out? EOS 0 0 9 sure, thanks for this. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Mindfulness and yoga have proven to help overcome feelings of low mood and perhaps you could try with taking a few deep breaths and listening to some calming music before going to bed tonight. Do you think that, you can try something like this? EOS 0 0 11 yoga sounds interesting but i will try starting it by weekend. some calming music will do at the moment. any suggestions for me? EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am so proud of you for giving this a try. I would like to suggest OCB relaxing music, which will help you relax.
2 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are we doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Okay how are you? EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Im doing great thanks. Anything on your mind today? EOS 2 0 3 Just pondering microcheating and wondering why someone who I do not like that way would be considered microcheating. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] And what do you mean by microcheating? EOS 2 0 5 It is a new thing like having a man you like that you check up on on social media even though you are in a relationship, or eating lunch with the same woman or man that you like but you don' t act on because you are married. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh i see, well i think overthinking things like that can lead to unwanted emotions. Or putting yourself in a situation with another person when you are in a relationship might mean there are other issues going on. EOS 2 0 7 Yes i see that. No nothing else going on just thinking that the definition maybe shouldn' t be as exact for the type of person that I do not talk to because of his reservations about it. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, if you are not talking to them then i see no harm. If you are talking to them with some sort of intention to for a relationship beyond friendship then i see issues arising. EOS 2 0 9 That is what I feel. I am not talking to him. I had to the other day to get in contact with someone( medical emergency) but do not call just to chat and catch up. I even unfriended him. I just want to comfort him over it but I think it is best just to never speak of him again. Comfort my fiance. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] To never speak to your fiance? If you want to continue your relationship and you do not feel you can continue a platonic relationship with this other person then that might be best. EOS 2 0 11 No I am ending my friendship with him. That is what is best. EOS 2 1 12 [Question] I think it might be as well if you cannot control it. I do have to ask though, are you happy with your Fiance?
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? EOS 1 0 22 He' s a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly. EOS 1 0 24 But maybe I deserved it. EOS 1 1 25 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly. EOS 1 0 26 Yes, he did. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No you did not! Please don' t think like that.
0 0 0 Hello. Feeling low today. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it. EOS 0 0 2 I' ve been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn' t go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint? EOS 0 0 4 Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don' t have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions. EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress. EOS 0 0 6 Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products. I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. Challenging face - to - face, and I have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now. What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing. EOS 0 0 8 Thanks. It helps to know that I' m not alone. Most often, I work independently my work. Involves a lot of explaining and justification. Before we just all sat in the same room and worked together. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don' t convey the meaning 100 percent.

Id take this time to focus on you too. Strengthen the bond a bit. EOS 2 0 15 Yes, I think that would be best. I thank you for your time. EOS 2 1 16 [Greeting] I thank you for opening up! EOS 2 0 17 It is okay see talking about this is actually microcheating. So now I am worried about that. EOS 2 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really wouldnt even consider it cheating to have feelings. Acting on them or trying to strengthen them may be though. EOS 2 0 19 Yes that is true. My fiance is over seas for work for the next 13 mos so I am here in the states alone. We get to talk but he isnt here with me so having no one to talk to is lonely. That is why I brought it up. EOS 2 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see that, have you tried to talk to your friends about this issue? Or even try a therapist? Maybe you and your Fiance can figure out more times to talk with facetime or zoom. Do a virtual date night. EOS 2 0 21 Yes I don' t have any friend that arent men so I think therapy is going to help. I don' t talk to anyone anymore. But I thank you for your time. I just wanted to clarify why I brought it up. I hope you have a good day. EOS 2 1 22 [Greeting] I hope you do as well!

EOS 6 1 7 [Question] have you put in job applications everywhere. EOS 6 0 8 Yes I did, and quite a lot but I think because of the pandemic they are not hiring that much. EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] With this pandemic going on i know it is even more harder to get a job. EOS 6 0 10 yes. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you are right. Have you looked on the internet such as indeed? EOS 6 0 12 I' ve tried LinkedIn they have many companies hiring. maybe my CV is just bad. EOS 6 1 13 [Question] yes they do i am familiar with that. how is your resume looking? EOS 6 0 14 I think I could improve it. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you talked to someone in your family and see if they could help you with your resume to improve it. EOS 6 0 16 I' ve asked some friends, I think a friend will help me out when he' s not busy. EOS 6 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient. EOS 6 0 18 Yes I know. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried to go to place and talk to a hiring boss about a job? EOS 6 0 20 It' s hard with this virus to go anywhere pretty much. EOS 6 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] yes i can understand that. EOS 6 0 22 Worst time to graduate. Haven' t even got the graduation ceremony lol. EOS 6 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] all you can honestly really do right now is to try to improve your resume and see if that helps any and just keep searching for jobs and putting in applications and i know you will get a call from a job soon. yes it has been a bad year for anything to happen.

EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not.

EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open?

She didn' t really say a whole lot, she just left right afterwards. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think it would definitely help to talk to her about it, it is never good to let situations like this build up without being talked about.. EOS 3 0 21 That' s probably true, just a bit awkward. EOS 3 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I can definitely understand the awkwardness of the conversation, it was tough for me to have that conversation as well.. EOS 3 0 23 And I agree about making sure I talk with her. It' s not healthy. EOS 3 1 24 [Others] It is definitely not healthy. EOS 3 0 25 Thanks for being supportive. Relationships are tough.

Is there anything I can do? EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Well, if she is not listening to you when you try to talk to her you have to ask yourself whether the relationship is really worth it? EOS 4 0 7 That' s true. I didn' t think about it. Should I approach her and talk about it before? EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I think it' s always worth fighting for a friendship but there does come a point when it stops being at all viable. EOS 4 0 9 Yeah, that' s definitely true. I know she is a good person. So I would give her a chance and we can talk about it before. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Does she have younger siblings? I am the eldest of four and I sometimes, even at age forty five, find myself trying to tell them what to do. EOS 4 0 11 She have a younger brother that is 9 years younger. She used to be only child for a while before her brother was born.. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It could be the cause of her behaviour. EOS 4 0 13 Maybe that' s why. She have different personality than me. She is more into logical thinking and she love people and has bubbly personality. While I' m emotional but are social butterfly and after a while, I would need a break from people.. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] How much would it hurt you to end the friendship? Do you think you could make other friends and survive it or is it worth fighting for?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! How are you doing? EOS 0 0 1 im ok kinda stressed. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Anything I can help with:)? Feeling stressed is never fun:( What has been making you feel stressed? EOS 0 0 3 im feeling very overwhelmed and cant get anything done cause i dont know where to start! i want to declutter my house but dont know where to start. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I hear you, feeling overwhelmed and like you don' t know where to start can leave a person feeling stressd forsure! Decluttering sounds like a great idea! Sometimes taking baby steps is a good place to start! EOS 0 0 5 but there are so many thinggs to do and ideas i have. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Of course! It can feel so stressful when we have all these little things we want to do but don' t know where to start! EOS 0 0 7 should i start in one room or one group of things and collect them from all the rooms? EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What is one little area that maybe seems easier to start with? Yeah, that' s a great idea! EOS 0 0 9 well i seem to start and them i end up jumoing to another thing! jumping. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, well that' s okay! starting is half the battle, so that' s an accomplishment right there! EOS 0 0 11 thanx that helps cause i start feeling defeated. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried maybe using a timer or making a list to help keep you focused on decluttering one area at a time? Of course! It' s easy to be hard on ourselves, but just the fact that you are trying is so important! EOS 0 0 13 u know what i bought a timer and it came in today! hopefully it will help! EOS 0 1 14 [Others] Oh awesome! I am so glad! Maybe trying that out could be useful! EOS 0 0 15 i have no type of supportin my life and it really does effect me. thanx for all your positively. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Having no support is so hard:( Especially during these times! EOS 0 0 17 im gonna start again tomorrow with more faith in myself. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] Of course! Do you feel like you have people that you could reach out to if you start getting lonely?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:)
6 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there! How may I support you? EOS 6 0 2 Well, I' m really upset with my friends. EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I am so sorry to hear that. Did something happen? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, they aren' t taking COVID seriously. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns? EOS 6 0 6 Yes but they get angry with me. I don' t know how to get through to them, EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It' s also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right. EOS 6 0 8 I really don' t know I just haven' t been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out. It' s a weird dynamic. EOS 6 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you' re finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it' s the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right? EOS 6 0 10 That' s exactly right. EOS 6 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is such a hard position to be in. it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance. EOS 6 0 12 I' d like to think so but I wish they would too. It' s hard to know what is right. EOS 6 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have found that having vitural movie nights, or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected. Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try? EOS 6 0 14 Yes, but they' ll have their BBQs and parties anyway. They are having a group Thanksgiving and there will be a lot of people there. My husband and I feel bad that we aren' t going, but we also know it isn' t smart. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can' t live your life in fear, and that they' re going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware. EOS 6 0 16 We feel like after this is all over, they will still remind us that we were standoffish during this time. And I agree. The longer we put it off and don' t take it seriously, the longer it will last. EOS 6 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Can you tell them that that just isn' t the case? You and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others. If I am correct, it has nothing to do with the fact that you don' t want to see your pals and family! From chatting with you it sounds like your relationships with these people is incredibly important to you. EOS 6 0 18 Yes that' s totally accurate. Yes they are. They are good people. They just think living for the moment is the bigger picture. EOS 6 1 19 [Greeting] I hope your friends can see how important they are to you and thats a huge reason why you' re not seeing them. EOS 6 0 20 I think they do. They just think that this is a hoax. EOS 6 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I know a lot of people that think the same thing. I have one friend who thought that, and they ended up contracting COVID. Thankfully she was ok, but after she got it she definitely didn' t think it was a hoax anymore. I hope they understand the risk they are taking.
4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out. EOS 4 0 6 I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night? EOS 4 0 8 I can' t sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it' s typically late afternoon. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds like you are doing the very best you can under difficult circumstances. you should feel very proud about that. EOS 4 0 10 thank you. i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] it sounds to me that your sleep issue is really weighing on your mind. you may be setting yourself up for sleep issues by thinking about this so much. is that possible? EOS 4 0 12 yes it may be. i' m not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you' re under a lot of pressure. it' s only natural that you would feel overwhelmed. dont be hard on yourself. you' re doing the best you can. EOS 4 0 14 thank you. that is very supportive. i just dont know how to make the next ten days go by faster. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can spend some time doing pleasant things. it is true that time seems to go fast when we' re having fun. EOS 4 0 16 that' s true. i thought about maybe playing video games. EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] fantastic! that' s a great way to spend your time. EOS 4 0 18 maybe overwatch. i haven' t been playing them much. EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] i' m wondering: are you a reader? do you enjoy reading? i' m asking because i find when i read a good book, time seems to move very quickly. EOS 4 0 20 i am. but i have a hard time focusing as of late. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can make a goal of reading a few pages and then see if you can build on that. then, if you want, you can make a goal of reading a chapter. EOS 4 0 22 that' s a great idea. that may help a lot with focus. EOS 4 1 23 [Self-disclosure] personally i love reading; especially non fiction. what type of books do you enjoy? EOS 4 0 24 dystopian fantasy style books. and also historical nonfiction. EOS 4 1 25 [Self-disclosure] i enjoy historical non fiction very much. do you have any favorite authors? EOS 4 0 26 lauren destefano. her series the chemical garden trilogy is my favorite. EOS 4 1 27 [Question] has she written anything you haven' t read yet that you think you would enjoy? EOS 4 0 28 that' s also another good idea. i haven' t read all of her bookis. EOS 4 1 29 [Question] do you live near a library?
3 0 0 Hello, is someone there? EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, my name is Jonathan. May I ask who I am speaking to today? EOS 3 0 2 Hi Jonathan, I' m Keri. EOS 3 1 3 [Greeting] Hi Keri. How are you today? EOS 3 0 4 I' m feeling a little bit down today. I' ve been feeling a little bit down a lot lately. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh no. I' m sorry to hear that. What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately?
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. EOS 3 0 16 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. EOS 3 0 18 That is a good point.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. EOS 3 0 20 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand. EOS 3 0 22 I should trust my partner more than any random person. EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters. EOS 3 0 24 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? EOS 3 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you.... even after work. EOS 3 0 26 okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. EOS 3 0 28 That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you? EOS 3 0 30 Okay. I will keep that in mind. We are 22. EOS 3 1 31 [Question] Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? EOS 3 0 32 Yes but less over the past few months. EOS 3 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related.... for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. EOS 3 0 34 That' s understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. EOS 3 1 35 [Providing Suggestions or Information] How do you all generally communicate? Through text? EOS 3 0 36 He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends.. EOS 3 1 37 [Question] Which do you and your man like to communicate?
3 0 0 I' m so depressed, I just got layed off. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I am sorry to hear that, did you apply for unemployment benefit? That at least can help you financially until you get a new job. EOS 3 0 2 Yes, it will take weeks and the holidays are just around the corner. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sucks it happens so close to the holidays. I understand it' s hard to accept but I' d recommend talking with someone close to you like a friend and family member. EOS 3 0 4 I know, with all the other crap going on now everyone else has their own problems they don' t want to hear mine. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure someone will be there for you, they know you need them the most right now. If you don' t feel comfortable talking to them, you can seek online therapist. There are a lot of free service for mental car. EOS 3 0 6 They' re busy with other people' s problems. I' ll deal with it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It' s not gonna be easy, but at the same time not impossible. Try looking at it a different way. You can use this time to train your skills or do things that you' ve wanted to but didn' t have the time. EOS 3 0 8 I wanted to travel but that' s not a good idea right now. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] You can still travel domestically or just around your city. I like taking a walk in the park or wandering downtown to clear my mind.
3 0 0 hello. how are you today? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today?. EOS 3 0 2 a bit sad. more depressed. its just i keep getting benched at work. i' m not really sure what do to.* to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset. EOS 3 0 4 i' m not really sure what i' m doing wrong. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though. EOS 3 0 6 what can i do though? EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there' s anything going on? EOS 3 0 8 hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Of course! That sounds frustrating to not know why it' s happening and not have the opportunity to ask. EOS 3 0 10 yes... hrm. that may work. how can i stop being depressed all the time though.. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' ve also had bosses that are infrequently in the office and make getting good information hard. EOS 3 0 12 how did you fix the issue? i work at home and its like just trying to reach out - they are always busy. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren' t always a reflection of us or how we' re performing.
3 1 0 [Question] Good day, how are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 Not too well. I have been depessed because of our state shut down and today an old friend from unior high school passed. EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that. I absolutely understand, it' s been hard on most people having to deal with the current state of affairs and losing people.. Do you think things will improve? EOS 3 0 3 Thank you. I know we are all in the same predicament.. I think things will improve, but not for a year or more.. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I agree. I lost a teacher some time ago and I' ve been thinking a lot about when things might improve. A year seems plausible. Since it' s so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up? EOS 3 0 5 A year is a long time when y. A year is a long time when you are 76 years old. I just want to enjoy the rest of our lives - my husband and me - and travel until we can' t enjoy it any longer. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that. It is really tough being restricted to not travelling. I call my parents( around your age) about once a week. EOS 3 0 7 Thank you so much for your support. It is tough and there is nothing to do. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have family you can talk to? Have you considered volunteering? I ask because my neighbor bakes for the local food bank and it helps her. EOS 3 0 9 Yes, I do, but I can' t talk to my son in Florida because he lost his job and havng tough time. I don' t feel like I should enjoy my life when he is suffering. We may need to help him financially. I use to volunteer at a nursing home, but I am afraid to now with the virus. EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is reasonable. And it sounds like you are doing all you can. Could you teach from home online and keep yourself safe? Or perhaps provide your son financial support? EOS 3 0 11 I am trying to do what I can for my son and also to help so I don' t get too down and depressed. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are doing everything you can. Some things are just beyond our control. And we are all struggling, so please know you are not alone in your feelings. EOS 3 0 13 Thank you - that makes me feel some better. You are right and I learned more than ever that some things I con' t control. Yes, we are all struggling and trying to get this this pandemic. I am sorry that we are all going through this and pray it will get over soon. EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] I couldn' t agree more. We will get through this with each others help. EOS 3 0 15 Yes, we will get through this - it helps so much to have others support. I do thank you very much for talking with me today. Have a great day! EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] You too, have a wonderful day and know you are in my thoughts.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Much better than normal, even though the stock market is down. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Are you an investor? EOS 0 0 3 I am a student that tries to put as much money into as possible. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand the struggle with being at that stage in life. Has this affected you negatively? EOS 0 0 5 No the stock market really doesn' t cause stress for me, mostly just small things that I think my brain overreacts to. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] What sorts of things?
4 1 0 [Question] What is going on today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling really down about my breakup. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] \ So you have had a breakup recently and you are feeling down about it. EOS 4 0 3 Yes. I thought that it wouldn' t be terrible because I initiated it but now I regret it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] So are you doubting that you made the right decision or are you just feeling sadness at the loss you are feeling right now. EOS 4 0 5 I' m mainly doubting my decision and I know there' s nothing I can do about it. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You must have had good reason' s to have made the decision to breakup and to have initiated it. Its normal to doubt yourself afterwards. You may want to remind yourself of the reasons that you came to your decision you did. Im sure the reasons are still valid. EOS 4 0 7 I did it because I' m trying to focus on self - improvement but looking back now, there' s no reason I couldn' t have improved myself with my partner. EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up. In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single.. EOS 4 0 9 That' s what I hope for. I just can' t get over missing my partner because they were great to me, I just needed to be alone. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think you are feeling a loss even though you feel that at this time you need to be alone to focus on your own growth. When you had the conversation about this breakup were you honest about why you need the space and that your problem was not with the relationship but with maybe the timing. I think with communication and after growth perhaps by keeping the door open with this person maybe you can have some sort of relationship in the future even if its friendship or maybe more. You are doing what is right for yourself at the given time. EOS 4 0 11 I did get the chance to explain my reasons a few days after the breakup. We were friendly and talked casually for a few more days and then they said they needed to space to get themselves together. We haven' t really talked since then. The problem is I' m open to something in the future but I don' t know that they are and I can' t find the courage to ask. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have been in both situations before the one who needed space and also as the one who was broken up with. I think right now the best thing you can do for you and the person is to stick with your decision and give them time they also may need space to process and deal with the breakup and growth for themselves without really letting go you won' t be able to grow in time you can have a conversation and ask but it might be six months down the road wait for them to come to you they have asked for time as you did too soon. EOS 4 0 13 I think I can do that. They needed space because it was hard going from being in a relationship to being friends in a matter of days. I guess I' ll just have to continue working on myself and see how things go. EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Focusing on yourself sounds like the best thing you can do. Start on that list of self improvements you want to make. Connect with friends you may have lost touch with. Your going to be great. EOS 4 0 15 I like that idea. Thank you for your help! EOS 4 1 16 [Greeting] Your welcome and I love that you are so dedicated to your development.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello how are you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I am good, how are you? EOS 3 0 3 I am doing well just dealing with some problems with my friends. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I' m sorry, what type of problems are you having? EOS 3 0 5 Friends not being there for me when I need emotional support. They also do not pay for their stuff when we go out to eat or go to the bar as well. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand, you are having issues with your friends not being there for you emotionally and you are worried about them taking advantage of you when you go out.. EOS 3 0 7 Yes that is exactly it. Just sucks not having that emotional support. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] I completely understand what you are feeling. Have you tried to talk to your friends about your concerns? It helps to clear the air and make sure everyone understands everyone elses perspective. EOS 3 0 9 I have and it seems that they just tell me what I would like to hear! It sucks when I am always there for them when they need me but they cannot do the same. EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have had the same problems in the past with some friends not being there for me when I need it, so I completely understand where you' re coming from.. EOS 3 0 11 It' s good to know that I am not the only one going through this. What is your advice from experience with this? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have anyone else to talk to about what you' re going through? It also helps a lot of the time to talk to an objective 3rd part to help give you some advice on what they think you should do.. EOS 3 0 13 My grandma mostly who is an experienced family therapist but she is going through her own stuff as well. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Another thing that might help is focusing on some of your hobbies, I often find it helpful to use my hobbies to get my mind off of things that are bothering me.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking?

EOS 6 0 7 yes. EOS 6 1 8 [Question] Do you have a husband or bf? EOS 6 0 9 I could say I am a female that is one of those left out. not currently. I really don' t know how those women find partners and get married and stay with the same partner for a long time. EOS 6 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You get frustrated that other people are achieving something, you are not able to do. Is that a fair understanding?
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why? EOS 4 0 8 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID - 19 lockdowns. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] How long have you been working there? EOS 4 0 10 I am very sad about this country and my work situation. For 5 years. I work in accounting. EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID - 19 really has got us all down. EOS 4 0 12 What a great nation we live in..... a future 3rd world one. Yeah, but I was a good accountant. EOS 4 1 13 [Others] WOW, I' m sure that is a big change for you... EOS 4 0 14 Yeah, I have not told my wife about it just yet. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] I agree, this country has got some issues but we can get through them. Uh, oh, how do you think she will react? EOS 4 0 16 Yeah, I am not sure. I better wait to break the news in 2021. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there. EOS 4 0 18 And I am not the only one who is losing my job. Seems that all of accounting is going to be getting the axe. It makes me sad.... EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year. Do you have a resume? EOS 4 0 20 Plus, I have a 50 dollar a day spending habit on lottery tickets to one day hit it BIG. Yes, I have a resume that I have not updated just yet. I have a college education and a CPA to boot, but I need one lucky break in life. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes that will help to get a better perspective on things... taking some time away from everything in order to catch a breath. EOS 4 0 22 Maybe I can spend some quality time with my kids without them knowing I will be out of a job as of 01/ 15/ 2021. It is almost Christmas, too. EOS 4 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I hear ya, I feel like that quite a bit. Like if isn' t one thing it' s another. I' m sure your wife will understand how the economy has gotten and that she knows that it isn' t your fault. EOS 4 0 24 Maybe, but we have a huge mortgage and two BMW' s. We spend lavishly.... Plus, I spend 50 dollars a day on lotto. EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times, but remember all the good times you have had. Those would not be good times if it were' nt for tough times. EOS 4 0 26 True, but the Office was my home away from home. I need to figure out how to deal with my sadness..... EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times. Do you have any hobbies?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today. EOS 3 0 2 I feel bad putting this on your shoulders, maybe you can help. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] i have big shoulders! whats on your mind? EOS 3 0 4 I' m just struggling a lot to find the motivation to do anything at all, even the most basic of things. Sometimes I get very intense feelings of sadness and just want to drop everything I' m doing, like I can' t do anything more. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] i think a lot of people are feeling that way these past few months. do you think it is covid related? not sickness, more depression. EOS 3 0 6 Yes that' s very true, depression is probably hitting people the worst right now. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] its becoming a new normal lol. EOS 3 0 8 No I' ve been fighting depression since I was probably like 12 years old, it first really hit me when I moved from where I was living all my life and lost all my friends and I was terrified. Now I' m 29. But covid definitely plays a factor. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] a few months ago i was feeling the same way. i dont have health insurance but googled and found some online docturs. i got to see a doc and get on antidepressants for less than a hundred. covid plays a factor in EVERYTHING ugh. EOS 3 0 10 So you had the therapy session online with them via webcam or you found them online first then went to see them in person. Yeah covid is doing damage in more ways than one. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] all online!:) meds shipped to my door. i love it! EOS 3 0 12 Wow that' s great. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] theres a free site called 7 cups that does free peer to peer couseling too. its good when i have a lot on my mind. EOS 3 0 14 I would have to do it in person, I don' t want people I live with to hear about all my pathetic mental problems. Oh 7 cups, I had an account there and met a really nice girl there that was helping me and she was living with an abusive family at the same time, its crazy but now I can' t access that account anymore, I' m so sad about that. I think it says the account doesn' t exist when I try to login now. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] can you make a new one? EOS 3 0 16 Sure I guess I' ll have to do that but I really wanted to get back into that account, don' t want to lose contact with that girl that was helping me. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] cerebral is that one site with the cheap docs. EOS 3 0 18 do you mean um.... cheap med? cerebral seems to be an antidepressant when i googled. EOS 3 1 19 [Others] check the website q and a. EOS 3 0 20 oh wait nevermind i spoke too soon. EOS 3 1 21 [Others] for cups maybe thers a contact you can email to try to regain access. EOS 3 0 22 Yeah definitely, I should try contacting their support to try and restore my account. EOS 3 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] they are doing so much things now, you just gotta get on google and see whats out there! i think you are going to be okay, there are definately tough times but you seem to have a grip on knowing what you need. that is great.

4 1 0 [Question] Hello, my name is Rose, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi Rose. I' m ok, but I get embarrassed about my curly hair. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What about your hair is embarrasing exactly? Curls seem like a lovely thing to have( mine is dead straight, lets trade lol) But no, seriously, what in particular don' t you like about it? i admire people who have natural curls. EOS 4 0 3 They are unruly and not the pretty kind of curls. Often get frizzy by the end of the day. It get' s frustrating when I always look a mess. EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I could see that being frustrating, if you can' t keep them neat. is your hair short or long? EOS 4 0 5 It is long. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you thought of having it shorter, it might be easier to tame? Just a thought.... you say you always look like a mess... is that your personal opinion or has anyone else commented on your hair? EOS 4 0 7 I started to cut it shorter last time, but my stylist said it would be big. It is hard to find the right product.. It is my personal opinion.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you asked a friend for an honest opinion? EOS 4 0 9 My friend likes my hair, but also says she can see that it is hard to manage. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance.. EOS 4 0 11 I can totally relate to that. I think we always want what we dont have. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One thing I have started doing, since my hair hasn' t been cut for a year due to pandemic, is wearing hats. my hair is driving me crazy, so I get your frustration. Is it long enough to braid?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello how are you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I am good, how are you? EOS 3 0 3 I am doing well just dealing with some problems with my friends. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I' m sorry, what type of problems are you having? EOS 3 0 5 Friends not being there for me when I need emotional support. They also do not pay for their stuff when we go out to eat or go to the bar as well. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand, you are having issues with your friends not being there for you emotionally and you are worried about them taking advantage of you when you go out.. EOS 3 0 7 Yes that is exactly it. Just sucks not having that emotional support. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] I completely understand what you are feeling. Have you tried to talk to your friends about your concerns? It helps to clear the air and make sure everyone understands everyone elses perspective. EOS 3 0 9 I have and it seems that they just tell me what I would like to hear! It sucks when I am always there for them when they need me but they cannot do the same. EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have had the same problems in the past with some friends not being there for me when I need it, so I completely understand where you' re coming from.. EOS 3 0 11 It' s good to know that I am not the only one going through this. What is your advice from experience with this? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have anyone else to talk to about what you' re going through? It also helps a lot of the time to talk to an objective 3rd part to help give you some advice on what they think you should do.. EOS 3 0 13 My grandma mostly who is an experienced family therapist but she is going through her own stuff as well. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Another thing that might help is focusing on some of your hobbies, I often find it helpful to use my hobbies to get my mind off of things that are bothering me. EOS 3 0 15 That is definitely helpful. I will look into being more productive and also doing more hobbies around the house to help clear my mind. Any hobbies that you do now that really help? EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I enjoy building model cars in my free time, it really does a good job of keeping me occupied. I also find that reading helps a lot too!
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. EOS 3 0 16 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. EOS 3 0 18 That is a good point.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. EOS 3 0 20 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand. EOS 3 0 22 I should trust my partner more than any random person. EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters. EOS 3 0 24 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? EOS 3 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you.... even after work. EOS 3 0 26 okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. EOS 3 0 28 That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you? EOS 3 0 30 Okay. I will keep that in mind. We are 22. EOS 3 1 31 [Question] Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? EOS 3 0 32 Yes but less over the past few months. EOS 3 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related.... for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other.

4 0 0 I face the situation of me being sad because I thought we could let this fight go over time but instead it has lead to us breaking up. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about the fight? EOS 4 0 2 Yes, so we had a fight previously over Thanksgiving Break about how I woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. Then I pick her up to go try and get breakfast... then she starts punching me while I drive so I pull over. Then she keeps hitting me until I tell her to stop. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple. Is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else? EOS 4 0 4 It is because I do really miss her. I really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Breakups are hard, but it sounds like she was violent. EOS 4 0 6 Yeah she was a little violent. I was honestly a little scared for my life for a second but people make mistakes. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Have you talked since then? EOS 4 0 8 We have talked a little bit before hand this month. It was okay but I am still sad about what happened. She was very open to talking and such but I just wasn' t ready because my family found out about what happened and are worried about my safety. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If safety is an issue, then I think that maybe moving on is a good decision. EOS 4 0 10 I know but I am so sad because the break up was so quick and we did not really have closure after the whole fight happened between us. I still keep on thinking about her. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. Don' t be in a hurry to get into a new relationship, but if one happens that would be great too. Is this your first breakup? EOS 4 0 12 I will definitely try to get over her using those techniques you just said. It' s way harder to do than say though. No, this is not my first breakup with a woman but I felt like she was the one for me. EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] Breakups are not always the end, but they usually happen for a reason, and whenever violence is involved it is usually better to move on. EOS 4 0 14 Maybe you' re right! Just need to get productive and get my mind off of her for good since she was violent. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest you start trying to have fun with others and getting yourself out there where there will be new opportunities.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello, I am looking for help in managing some depression. EOS 3 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You' ve come to a good place to start. Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 3 I am feeling resentful towards my husband for quitting his job, and my son for being the reason that he quit his job.. My son' s behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us. EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband' s loss of work and your son' s loss of his job is entirely understandable.
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 2 I have been better. I had a rough semester in school.. EOS 6 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So things haven' t been going well at school. I think a lot of people are going through these days. EOS 6 0 4 It was alright at first but I failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade. EOS 6 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m sorry to hear that. That' s a heck of a situation to be in. Is there anything you can do? Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock? EOS 6 0 6 Yes, I already tried to appeal my grade. EOS 6 1 7 [Question] And the teacher wouldn' t budge? EOS 6 0 8 Sadly, no. I think they were too busy to really take a long time to discuss it or work with me. EOS 6 1 9 [Question] Was this for a course that was required for a major? EOS 6 0 10 It was a core class and I needed it to graduate. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ok, if you' re willing to give it one more shot, try to appeal the grade one more time. If that doesn' t work, you could try talking the class again next semester or during the summer if it' s offered. EOS 6 0 12 That does sound like a good idea. I am just so disappointed I' m not sure if it is worth it. EOS 6 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I know what you mean. I failed a Calc class once and I felt so empty inside. But I pulled myself together to take it again and passed it. I think you can do it too. EOS 6 0 14 I think you' re right. The class is tough and I know I can do it if I put my mind to it. EOS 6 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Exactly! You' ve got what it takes to make it through the difficulty, and your experiences so far will help you.
3 1 0 [Question] Hi! Hope you are doing well? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, yes am doing well. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Glad to know that you are doing well. How may I assist you today? EOS 3 0 3 I had a drinking challenge which has been affecting my marriage for quit sometime now. EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So as far as I understand that you had issues with your wife due to your drinking. Am I right? EOS 3 0 5 Yes that is true. EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is really a serious problem. I know it must be very tough time for you. Hope you are trying your best to save your marriage. EOS 3 0 7 Yes I have really reduced my drinking to ensure I save my marriage. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] That' s is a great initiative. I know it is tough for you but not impossible. I can feel how hard you are trying t save your relationship. I appreciate you for that. EOS 3 0 9 Thank you for the encouragement. Will do everything I can to save the situation. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Family comes first. I would do anything to save my marriage as you are doing. I am proud of you. I am pretty sure you both love each other more than anything.
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 1 0 1 I could be better. How about U? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] I am doing well. Whats bothering you? EOS 1 0 3 A friend screwed me out of money and a business venture. I am no longer friends with her. We were really close before this.. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! I am so sorry that has happened to you. That must feel like such a betrayal. Can you tell me more about it? EOS 1 0 5 It does. I' ve known her for 14 years and we dated. I invested a lot of money in a business she wanted to do. She took the money and ran. EOS 1 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back. EOS 1 0 7 What do you suggest? EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Did you sign anything? or have proof of what happened?
3 0 0 hello. anyone there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with today?
3 0 0 Hi, how' s your day going? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello. Im doing good. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 2 Not so good unfortunately. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why. Can you talknto me about it? EOS 3 0 4 Due to this pandemic, I am fearful for my job security and future in general. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how are you feeling. Its not that easy going through this pandemic. EOS 3 0 6 There is currently a lock down in my area. It seems like things are getting worse. My anxiety is high. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how are you feeling. Im kind of going in the same situation. But you have to keep calm. You have to look things at this way, maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home. I believe God put us in this situation to appreciate more our surroundings. EOS 3 0 8 I doubt it will get better, but thanks for the positive vibes. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you ever try to talk to your love one at home? Or maybe take time to communicate more with your friends? EOS 3 0 10 No, but I' ve been taking medication for my depression. Any suggestion on activities to help me past time? EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Well i dont know when this is going to end but if we let this isolation win the we are going to get worse. So I would recommend to share time with your love one and clear your mind and take out all the negative things away. Right now Im talking a lot with my brother and me and him never get along. So this is a huge step. EOS 3 0 12 That is great to hear. I wish I had someone I can talk to. Now I feel even more depressed. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Another thing i can recomend is try to read some books. That will help. I dont like reading but Im doing it and sometimes by doing it relaxed me and get me to another place. EOS 3 0 14 What kind of book genres do you recommend? EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, I love fictions and mystery. Right now I just finished" The Davinci Code".
3 1 0 [Question] hi how' s it going today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you? EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future? EOS 3 0 5 Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it' s true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online? EOS 3 0 7 Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression. EOS 3 0 9 How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] the" little black rain cloud" people? LOL I try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it' s our first. EOS 3 0 11 Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] While there is a lot to focus on that is just awful, it has really helped me to look back to the spanish flue of 1918. that pandemic was followed byt he roaring 20s. EOS 3 0 13 I know people thinking the country will collapse soon. Hard to deal with them. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The doomsday people are always around. remeber they mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012. EOS 3 0 15 I have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. Especially during the holidays. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] are you familiar with Mr. Rogers' story about looking for the helpers when things go bad? EOS 3 0 17 No but I did love that show as a kid. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Family is hard! So many strong emotions and opinions that aren' t always helpful. anyone in particular for you? EOS 3 0 19 My dad and my GF' s dad both have their own opinons on things. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people.
3 0 0 hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hey. How are you? EOS 3 0 2 i am not feeling too great. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why not? EOS 3 0 4 i am not able to find a job for over 5 years. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] How have you been able to get by? EOS 3 0 6 i am on social assiatnce but its not enough and i feel so worthless. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If you keep trying things will work out in the end. EOS 3 0 8 but i have been tryin for so long, i dont know what ti do. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Perhaps you havent searched well enough, have you gone to many interviews?
5 1 0 [Question] Hi there. How are you today? EOS 5 0 1 I' m good. how r u? EOS 5 1 2 [Question] I' m doing good today. What brings you on here? EOS 5 0 3 I' m not happy with an ex friend who talks behind my back to my current friends. EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] ugh. There' s nothing worse than that. Have you confronted the ex friend? EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking. EOS 5 1 6 [Question] oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it? EOS 5 0 7 they' re still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander. EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s an option but I hope it doesn' t go that far again. Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend? EOS 5 0 9 no. i don' t want anything to do with her. if i find out my friends take her side they will be my ex friend too. EOS 5 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand that. You don' t want two people disrespecting you.. EOS 5 0 11 absolutely not. i have a strong constitution about myself and don' t allow to be disrespected by anyone. EOS 5 1 12 [Question] I hear that! What happened in court when you went? If you don' t mind me asking. EOS 5 0 13 i tried to get an order for her to stay away from me. the first judge passed it but the second judge said it wasn' t strong enough.. EOS 5 1 14 [Question] Sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can. Has she been in contact with you? EOS 5 0 15 no. she hasn' t done anything lately for me to get a court order. if she starts anything again i will get a lawyer and sue her. EOS 5 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Seems like a good idea. Steer clear of her and don' t associate with her! Sounds like you' re doing the right thing. Keep your side of the street clean. EOS 5 0 17 absolutely will avoid her. if she ever convinces my friends should i tell them i don' t want to associate with them anymore? EOS 5 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would if I were in your shoes. You don' t need two of the same person. Know what I mean? EOS 5 0 19 yeah exactly. people need to realize who' s side to stay on. EOS 5 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] LOL if only everyone had that thought process. Some people don' t get it! EOS 5 0 21 it' s easier said than done. a lot of people are afraid of being alone and will put up with garbage. EOS 5 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Definitely sounds like you have the right tools and mindset to do the right thing! I know about the alone thing especially in these times. EOS 5 0 23 yeah it sucks lol. EOS 5 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Take those tools you have, steer clear of her and do your own thing!
1 0 0 I am so mad that I can' t see straight. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello! What is on your mind today? Oh really? Why is that? EOS 1 0 2 Well, my boyfriend has cheated so many times that I cant count them. I then meet someone nice and cheat on him once and now he breaks up with me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] being mad that your boyfriend cheated is normal. being mad when dumped is normal. don' t you think you DESERVE better than he was treating you? EOS 1 0 4 Thank you! I can see that I am talking to someone who understands. I am wondering if I should beg him back?? I really do love him. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there too. Expecially with covid, it can be hard realiing you may be alone and it may be frusterating dating someone new. if you really love someone, shouldnt they love you back? did his actions show love? EOS 1 0 6 Yeah, and we have been together since high school so it is really hard to think of ever marrying anyone else. He asked me to marry him but we never made it official or got rings. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak. i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart.
6 0 0 Hi. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. how are you? how may i help you today? EOS 6 0 2 Kinda sad today. Wanted to ask for some mental support. EOS 6 1 3 [Question] what is making you sad? EOS 6 0 4 Not being able to find a job after graduation. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand how you are feeling i had the same problem after i graduated. EOS 6 0 6 okay. EOS 6 1 7 [Question] have you put in job applications everywhere. EOS 6 0 8 Yes I did, and quite a lot but I think because of the pandemic they are not hiring that much. EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] With this pandemic going on i know it is even more harder to get a job. EOS 6 0 10 yes. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you are right. Have you looked on the internet such as indeed? EOS 6 0 12 I' ve tried LinkedIn they have many companies hiring. maybe my CV is just bad. EOS 6 1 13 [Question] yes they do i am familiar with that. how is your resume looking? EOS 6 0 14 I think I could improve it. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you talked to someone in your family and see if they could help you with your resume to improve it. EOS 6 0 16 I' ve asked some friends, I think a friend will help me out when he' s not busy. EOS 6 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi like I said a bit down. EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I did not see that, I am sorry. Do you want to talk about it? It might help. EOS 4 0 3 Ohh thank you for the offer. Proscanation is my thing i guess, and this days I am paying for it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Is it affecting your work or your home life? EOS 4 0 5 Yes it affects everything. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Can you give me an example of something that has been affected recently? For instance, I had been putting off cleaning my house and then some friends dropped by without warning and I was mortified. EOS 4 0 7 I didn' t meet deadline a year back, and lost my job. Now I couldn' t even pay rents. Living with a sibling. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That sounds bad. Have you considered you might be suffering from depression?
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi! What' s on your mind tonight?. EOS 4 0 1 I think a friend I' ve known for 30 years since college has drifted away from me. Even during the pandemic she has made new friends. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, I' m sorry, that' s not fun at all, especially since you two have been friends for so long. Have you tried reaching out to her by phone, email or social media?. EOS 4 0 3 She has cut our conversations short by saying she is tried. She will return text but I feel like I am always initiating. She likes watching tv show and told me with her NEW friend they Facetime and watch TV together. I really hate watching TV so don' t want to offer to participate. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, it' s a positive sign that she hasn' t blocked you completely. I agree, texting her each day could irritate her. That' s okay! You shouldn' t do anything that isn' t fun or enjoyable or comfortable for either of you, in my opinion. EOS 4 0 5 I am jealous that she is more successful in making new friends. I have not made a new friend in over 10 years. EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life. EOS 4 0 7 I don' t have many other friends and they are out of state. The one we are talking about lived an hour away but we would see each other 4 to 6 times a year, EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you' re saying you feel hurt and depressed at not being able to make new friends easily in the pandemic, correct? Ahhhh.,..... yes that; s difficult, oh boy. EOS 4 0 9 Hurt, mad, jealous. I have trouble getting out enough to make friends - even if there wasn' t a pandemic. I work a lot. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] For the time being we' re all stuck at home mostly, so maybe take some comfort in that in a strange way. Heck I rarely see my friends - maybe once a year, so I know how that feels. EOS 4 0 11 Good to know I' m not alone. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] On the bright side of things, at least you have a job. Do you enjoy your job? Maybe start friendships with coworkers, possibly. EOS 4 0 13 Work place is very small and I' m not in the clique there. Vaccine will be available to my age group soon and the weather is getting warmer. So there is that to look forward too. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] How often do you get out for fresh air? Sure it' s not going to solve the lack of friends but it does help to clear your mind to go outside the next few months after work. EOS 4 0 15 Good idea. I really hope being able to take walks will help me clear my thoughts. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, I agree with you, the warmer weather with the vaccine will probably speed up the end of all this. Cabin fever is real. EOS 4 0 17 I may join the book club when the library reopens. EOS 4 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard for people in our situation right now because there' s only so many virtual things to attend but maybe I just thought of a virtual cocktail hour, and you could go on Facebook or even meetup. com or a free dating site to connect with other people in our situation who live near you. The book club is a great idea. EOS 4 0 19 Good ideas. Thank you. It was nice chatting with you. EOS 4 1 20 [Others] Same here, wish I could' ve been more helpful but we' re in similar situations and nothing else came to my mind. Hang in there, you' re doing great under the circumstances!
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 I am fine thank you. How are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am very well. Do you have any problems you' d like to discuss with me? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I am having trouble figuring out how to handel a situation with a friend. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah, can you give me a few more details? I am sure I will be able to help/ EOS 0 0 5 Her husband was justshot and kiled over a drug deal. He was high on drugs at the time. My dayghter and his daughter are good friends and we carpool with them every day. He was often the driver not my friend. Was he high when he was driving my daughter arround? Did my friend know he was on drugs? EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow that is a tough one - I can see why you would be concerned about it. At least, though, you can be assured that she is safe and is never going to come to any harm as a result of his driving now. EOS 0 0 7 Agreed but it is hard to not be suspicious that the mom knew something about hi actions. Yet I feel horrible that she lost her husband. EOS 0 1 8 [Others] I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it:( EOS 0 0 9 I know. I am trying to be supportive and help her with her kids but a part of me is still anxious that she may have played me. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] People can hold values that to other people seem strange. She might not have considered it wrong to be driving on drugs, even though it is. EOS 0 0 11 Very true. I really never even considered that! EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would not make it acceptable though! EOS 0 0 13 No, absolutely not! But I never looked at it that way. EOS 0 1 14 [Others] At least you can feel relieved that your daughter is safe now:) EOS 0 0 15 Yes. I am very relieved. He was recently in a car accident before he died. Luckily no one was hurt and the girls were not in the car! He totaled his brand new truck though. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think the best you can do right now is just be there for your friend when she wants to talk. EOS 0 0 17 Definitely trying to be! EOS 0 1 18 [Question] Is she able to support herself financially?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day, how are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 Not too well. I have been depessed because of our state shut down and today an old friend from unior high school passed. EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that. I absolutely understand, it' s been hard on most people having to deal with the current state of affairs and losing people.. Do you think things will improve? EOS 3 0 3 Thank you. I know we are all in the same predicament.. I think things will improve, but not for a year or more.. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I agree. I lost a teacher some time ago and I' ve been thinking a lot about when things might improve. A year seems plausible. Since it' s so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up?

EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] chill my dear friend, nothing of that sort will happen. EOS 0 0 3 In - class learning was way better and I learned a lot but now its so confusing. EOS 0 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] everything you need is a little peace of mind, patience and little more effort. EOS 0 0 5 Even working with online tools is hard. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] i understand, but just think everyone else like us are doing the same and facing the same difficulties. EOS 0 0 7 I know but what is I loose a whole year in academic,. EOS 0 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Think positive my dear friend. Shake all your negatives. EOS 0 0 9 But I have been in low grades continuously during my last semesters. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Just have the confidence within yourselves and believe in YOU, that is the most important thing. Stop worrying, and think about what can make it better. EOS 0 0 11 Well it is still hard to understand online learning tools. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Watch Youtube videos. EOS 0 0 13 And my internet sometime screws up when I am submitting the assignments. I tried that but I am not tech savy. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Why cant you seek help from a friend of yours who studies well? And who is ready to spend time and help you. EOS 0 0 15 Due to social distancing I am not meeting with many people. But thanks for talking to me it gives me lot of hope. I shall try to learn from Youtube more maybe that is the only solution for online learning. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you dont have to meet a lot of people, but atleast one or two of your friends with all the safety measures? who could really help you, and also one of the best solution can be group studies as well. My pleasure dear friend.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello how are you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I am good, how are you? EOS 3 0 3 I am doing well just dealing with some problems with my friends. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I' m sorry, what type of problems are you having?
5 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. I' m here to listen. EOS 5 0 1 The unemployment office is overwhelmed and I' m overwhelmed trying to help my family member. EOS 5 1 2 [Providing Suggestions or Information] These days all of us have this situation. I can assure you that your family can understand it. How about an online job? EOS 5 0 3 Yes, it just very frustrating. My family member has taken another restaurant job only to lose it again for the same reasons, COVID. They have been going to temp services also. EOS 5 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I also worked in a coffee house and it has been closed for this damn virus. I feel sad too. But we should go on. EOS 5 0 5 The job center' s can only help so much. And if they don' t have internet skills, then online jobs will help. EOS 5 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] This sounds good. EOS 5 0 7 So this family member gave up their apartment, moved back in with family, still fighting unemployment and going to food banks. It' s crazy. They are doing what they can but when we talk about it, it' s hard to believe in these modern times we are in such a mess. EOS 5 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I wish this virus ends soon. But believe me everyone have similar situation these days. Did they try any online job? EOS 5 0 9 No online computer skills, but they now learned where to get some basic training. EOS 5 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] This sounds good. Wish to learn soon. I am mourning for my grandpa and my uncle that they gone for the Covid. You should be happy that you have them.
6 0 0 I am having a really hard time with something that I did to my boyfriend. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Do you want to talk about it? EOS 6 0 2 Yes, thank you! I was with him since childhood and we are actually still together. I slipped up one night and hate to admit what I did. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you' re holding onto a lot of guilt about this incident. Are you comfortable talking about that night? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, it is intense guilt. I can' t think of anything else. I hate to tell you but I cheated on him. I am so sorry and can' t look at myself in the mirror. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That can really weigh you down, beating yourself up with guilt. Does he know about the incident?

EOS 4 0 5 Yes it affects everything. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Can you give me an example of something that has been affected recently? For instance, I had been putting off cleaning my house and then some friends dropped by without warning and I was mortified. EOS 4 0 7 I didn' t meet deadline a year back, and lost my job. Now I couldn' t even pay rents. Living with a sibling. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That sounds bad. Have you considered you might be suffering from depression? EOS 4 0 9 Probably. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You sound quite lethargic. I think you should see a GP?
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship!
4 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello, How are you today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m really depressed. My fiance left me yesterday. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it? EOS 4 0 3 Yes, I think that might make me feel better. I really have no one to talk to because my family and friends didn' t like him so they think this is for the best. EOS 4 1 4 [Greeting] Ok. I am happy to listen.. EOS 4 0 5 I just don' t understand why someone would pretend to be happy for a year and then decide they were lying and leave. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Seems like you feel your partner betrayed you, does that sound right?. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I feel very betrayed.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is understandable. I know how you feel, may I suggest taking a few minutes to clear your head, and making a plan to talk with your friends and parents about how you feel? EOS 4 0 9 They think I should just get over it because they didn' t like him so they think I shouldn' t like him either. They' re making things worse for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] Oh I' m so sorry, sometimes family and friends don' t think about your feelings. When did this happen? EOS 4 0 11 He left yesterday. I had no warning. He just packed up all his stuff and said he didn' t want to marry me and the last year has been a lie. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Dang. he seems very selfish. But I understand how up setting it must have felt. My first husband left me without warning. EOS 4 0 13 I' m sorry to hear that. How long did it take you to feel better? EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Awhile. it started to feel a little bit better after I kept telling myself it was about him and not about me, then I started feeling a bit better. But it will take time, the old say is correct, good days and bad days.. EOS 4 0 15 What did you do to help feel better> EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Started back in to my routine. Work. Church. things like that.. EOS 4 0 17 I think it' s harder that it' s during the holidays because I don' t go back to work until after the new year. I thought we would be spending the next week together at home. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] My I suggestion you pick your closest friend, and talk to her/ him about your feeling, but not about your boyfriend, about how you feel your friends have been treating you. Be nice but firm. I bet once they hear your pain, they will be very supportive. EOS 4 0 19 Hopefully. I could really use to sit down with a friend right now and spend some quality time. I don' t want to be alone all week. EOS 4 1 20 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that! it is very reasonable to want to be around family and friends during the holidays.

EOS 4 0 5 because I didn' t trust him and I was always jelous. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think you should try finding a psychologist to help your jealous. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I think so, because I should not feel like that, I should trust him. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Apparently psychologist is good for people who want to share feelings and emotions. EOS 4 0 9 Yes, it' s true. Thanks for the information. I' m trying not to talk to him or think about him, because I feel better. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s good for you to do that. You' ll feel better with time. EOS 4 0 11 But it' s so hard do to that. I spend a lot of time with him. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I feel the same way. When it had happened with me. However, I talked it with my friends and family and made me feel much better. EOS 4 0 13 Yes. I' ll do it. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You should spend time for yourself now. Take care of yourself. EOS 4 0 15 Yes, I' m going to do that.

Curls seem like a lovely thing to have( mine is dead straight, lets trade lol) But no, seriously, what in particular don' t you like about it? i admire people who have natural curls. EOS 4 0 3 They are unruly and not the pretty kind of curls. Often get frizzy by the end of the day. It get' s frustrating when I always look a mess.

EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you thought of having it shorter, it might be easier to tame? Just a thought.... you say you always look like a mess... is that your personal opinion or has anyone else commented on your hair? EOS 4 0 7 I started to cut it shorter last time, but my stylist said it would be big. It is hard to find the right product.. It is my personal opinion.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you asked a friend for an honest opinion? EOS 4 0 9 My friend likes my hair, but also says she can see that it is hard to manage. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance..

EOS 4 0 7 where will I g et almost 3 thousand dollars. It is too painful. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I do not know.. have you considered taking an extra job on the side? EOS 4 0 9 yes, i do. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to get help with finding the books? Someone could have handed them in. EOS 4 0 11 school, should just give me enough time to find the books. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you have any idea of where you lost them? EOS 4 0 13 allow me to clear myself later, it is a fucking thing. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] I am sorry, I do not understand what you mean. EOS 4 0 15 I am trying to find that out, I packed them inside one bag, may be someone carried the bag or I misplace them. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Try not to worry, it is entirely possible that someone has found them and handed them in to the authorities. You might still get them back! EOS 4 0 17 i need enough time to look for the books, but school is not ready to listen to me. EOS 4 1 18 [Question] That is really not fair of them. Is there a higher authority you can take your case to? EOS 4 0 19 you are right. EOS 4 1 20 [Self-disclosure] They really should be doing more to help you. I know how frustrating it feels to lose something valuable. I did lose a really expensive ring one time but I got it back a week later.

EOS 0 0 3 im feeling very overwhelmed and cant get anything done cause i dont know where to start! i want to declutter my house but dont know where to start. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I hear you, feeling overwhelmed and like you don' t know where to start can leave a person feeling stressd forsure! Decluttering sounds like a great idea! Sometimes taking baby steps is a good place to start! EOS 0 0 5 but there are so many thinggs to do and ideas i have. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Of course! It can feel so stressful when we have all these little things we want to do but don' t know where to start! EOS 0 0 7 should i start in one room or one group of things and collect them from all the rooms? EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What is one little area that maybe seems easier to start with?

3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today. EOS 3 0 2 I feel bad putting this on your shoulders, maybe you can help. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] i have big shoulders! whats on your mind? EOS 3 0 4 I' m just struggling a lot to find the motivation to do anything at all, even the most basic of things. Sometimes I get very intense feelings of sadness and just want to drop everything I' m doing, like I can' t do anything more. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] i think a lot of people are feeling that way these past few months. do you think it is covid related? not sickness, more depression. EOS 3 0 6 Yes that' s very true, depression is probably hitting people the worst right now. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] its becoming a new normal lol. EOS 3 0 8 No I' ve been fighting depression since I was probably like 12 years old, it first really hit me when I moved from where I was living all my life and lost all my friends and I was terrified. Now I' m 29. But covid definitely plays a factor. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] a few months ago i was feeling the same way. i dont have health insurance but googled and found some online docturs. i got to see a doc and get on antidepressants for less than a hundred. covid plays a factor in EVERYTHING ugh. EOS 3 0 10 So you had the therapy session online with them via webcam or you found them online first then went to see them in person. Yeah covid is doing damage in more ways than one. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] all online!:) meds shipped to my door. i love it! EOS 3 0 12 Wow that' s great. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] theres a free site called 7 cups that does free peer to peer couseling too. its good when i have a lot on my mind. EOS 3 0 14 I would have to do it in person, I don' t want people I live with to hear about all my pathetic mental problems. Oh 7 cups, I had an account there and met a really nice girl there that was helping me and she was living with an abusive family at the same time, its crazy but now I can' t access that account anymore, I' m so sad about that. I think it says the account doesn' t exist when I try to login now. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] can you make a new one? EOS 3 0 16 Sure I guess I' ll have to do that but I really wanted to get back into that account, don' t want to lose contact with that girl that was helping me. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] cerebral is that one site with the cheap docs. EOS 3 0 18 do you mean um.... cheap med? cerebral seems to be an antidepressant when i googled. EOS 3 1 19 [Others] check the website q and a. EOS 3 0 20 oh wait nevermind i spoke too soon. EOS 3 1 21 [Others] for cups maybe thers a contact you can email to try to regain access. EOS 3 0 22 Yeah definitely, I should try contacting their support to try and restore my account. EOS 3 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] they are doing so much things now, you just gotta get on google and see whats out there! i think you are going to be okay, there are definately tough times but you seem to have a grip on knowing what you need. that is great. EOS 3 0 24 Yeah, I gotta do therapy thats a must and I think it has to be in person so I can try to let some of it out with someone face to face....... but that' s going to be very hard, to trust someone and open up about everything because its not just depression. Online is convenient but its just too much going on. EOS 3 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i agree, just with all the covid crap i know it can be hard to get a face to face!:) EOS 3 0 26 Right... EOS 3 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] its great that you know what you need to do though adn that you know what helps. is there anytihng else you want to talk about?
1 0 0 I' m qualified for a promotion but my boss is refusing to promote me based on biased feedback he has received from someone else. EOS 1 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn' t willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right? EOS 1 0 2 Yes that' s right. It' s frustratgn.* frustrating. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co - worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective.
4 0 0 I face the situation of me being sad because I thought we could let this fight go over time but instead it has lead to us breaking up. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about the fight? EOS 4 0 2 Yes, so we had a fight previously over Thanksgiving Break about how I woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. Then I pick her up to go try and get breakfast... then she starts punching me while I drive so I pull over. Then she keeps hitting me until I tell her to stop. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple. Is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else? EOS 4 0 4 It is because I do really miss her. I really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Breakups are hard, but it sounds like she was violent. EOS 4 0 6 Yeah she was a little violent. I was honestly a little scared for my life for a second but people make mistakes. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Have you talked since then? EOS 4 0 8 We have talked a little bit before hand this month. It was okay but I am still sad about what happened. She was very open to talking and such but I just wasn' t ready because my family found out about what happened and are worried about my safety. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If safety is an issue, then I think that maybe moving on is a good decision. EOS 4 0 10 I know but I am so sad because the break up was so quick and we did not really have closure after the whole fight happened between us. I still keep on thinking about her. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. Don' t be in a hurry to get into a new relationship, but if one happens that would be great too. Is this your first breakup?
1 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How may I help you today? EOS 1 0 1 hi. I am stressed with my 25 year old moved back from NYC.. My boyfriend and I have a home and my son does not like him. EOS 1 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that i can understand how you must be feeling. Why does your son not like your boyfriend? EOS 1 0 3 He is going back to school and I am supporting him in that. The problem is that my boyfriend thinks my son should speak to me more respectfully. He gets upset when my son is swears and shows anger to me. EOS 1 1 4 [Question] Have you talked to your boyfriend about how you are feeling? EOS 1 0 5 He knows that I am torn. I am not going to put my son out of the house. I am also not one to get loud and angry. My son verbally is aggressive. EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand why your boyfriend be getting upset if your son is disrespectful to you and is aggressive but you know that is your son and you going to be there for him no matter what. EOS 1 0 7 Yes, and I have gotten my son to go to a therapist weekly to try to express his anger about the pandemic and the changes it has brought in his lifestyle. He cannot take his frustrustations out on us. EOS 1 1 8 [Question] How long has this been going on? Is the therapist working for him? EOS 1 0 9 He came back last March for what we thought at the time would be a month or two. EOS 1 1 10 [Question] Have you had a conversation with your son about the way he is acting? EOS 1 0 11 He is difficult to get through to. He seems to have traded midwestern charm for NYC bullying. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe he should start seeing a therapist every day maybe that will help. EOS 1 0 13 I am not sure that he can afford that, but I have seen small changes in his behavior since he started seeing her. I want him to stop seeing my boyfriend as the enemy. EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe your boyfriend and your son needs to sit down and have a talk. EOS 1 0 15 That may work with a therapist. I have tried to mediate and both were terribly bull headed and argumentative. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] or you know your boyfriend can plan out a day or something and your son and your boyfriend can go out and do something fun. EOS 1 0 17 I am a quiet person and I want a happy household.. EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] They should have a talk because communication is key and that will solve a lot. EOS 1 0 19 Thank you. You are right. I just want to get rid of the tension in the house. EOS 1 1 20 [Others] I am sure he will stop the way he is acting it just may take some time. EOS 1 0 21 Thank you. I want him to grow him quickly. He is 25 and is doing okay. No need to be angry. EOS 1 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are right he still got a whole life ahead of him.

Very depressed with having to stay home because of the COVID - 19/ I will appreciate anything you can do to help me. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like social isolation is really weighing on you... EOS 4 0 5 Yes, it sure is. I feel so alone. I feel it will help to talk to an outsider. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Human being are social creatures by nature so please understand that the feelings that you are having are absolutely normal. So dont judge yourself or feel as if something is wrong with YOU.

EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so sorry you are worried about losing your job. I have been in your shoes before. Why do you think your boss wants to fire you? EOS 0 0 4 Thank you. I think if I am late again, I will be let go.. I have a sick child and my boss does not understand. How can I explain that I may be late to the office, but that I am a valuable employee? EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Have you explained to him your reasoning? I also once had to take care of my sick grandmother after work and had a tough time explaining it to my boss. Have you offered to stay later to make up the work? EOS 0 0 6 No. But that is a good idea. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe your boss can compromise with you. It' s worth a shot! EOS 0 0 8 It' s a very competitive office and I don' t want to look weak. EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] You sound like you care about this job and that is a valuable asset in a an employee.

4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 4 1 2 [Greeting] I am good how are you. EOS 4 0 3 I am glad you are doing well, I have been struggling lately as my girlfriend that I was going to propose to broke up with me. She told me that my career path was different then hers and she just did not see it working out. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] How was your career path different? I understand how you are feeling everything will be okay. EOS 4 0 5 She had a desire to do marine biology and I wanted to pursue law enforcement as a police officer, however due to my back injury that fell through recently. She would spend most of her time doing field work, which would require her to spend time out at sea. She was working in a nursing home at the time and was not a marine biologist.. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] She did not like your career path? EOS 4 0 7 I am thinking that would be the case, however we dated for 3 years and then reconnecting about a year later which at this time was a distant relationship. She now has a boyfriend which she started date about 2 months she broke up with me. I found out that he works with her at the nursing home. I am unsure what to think, but she did say that she just didn' t see how our career paths would work out and that was that.. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right. It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after.

But due to financial commitments, I am somewhat afraid of failing. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Life is full of surprises, but we should get advantage of bad situations. It' s totally fine to be afraid, but also at the same time you should try harder to reach your goal. EOS 0 0 13 Yes, so far life has been kind to me even if it surprised me at few places! I will try to make the most of the situation.. You are right! Hard work will pay. I need to pull my socks up... EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Courage is not the absence of the fear, you should fight to find your place.
3 0 0 Hello, I' ve been really depressed lately and feel like there isn' t anything I can do to break this feeling. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened? EOS 3 0 2 November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS( its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 4 Yes that is correct. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest. EOS 3 0 6 I know I' m not alone and that' s what makes it hard to reach out, because I don' t want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there' s. It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do. It seems that you don' t want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person. EOS 3 0 8 I just don' t know what to do about it anymore. Yes, I don' t like to bother others or let other people down. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure. Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief? Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think? EOS 3 0 10 It is a lot, I' m used to being the person that everyone comes to for help, but I am not very good at asking for help myself. I have seen a doctor and they started my new medicine regimen but unfortunately there is no cure for this disease. I was going to physical therapy but finished that right as Covid started.. Plus it does get better as the weather gets warmer so the winter has been hard, really looking forward to spring and summer for a little relief. EOS 3 1 11 [Others] I' m sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now. EOS 3 0 12 I' d be open to doing Yoga once things open back up, but having this disease puts me in a high risk category so my interaction outside the home still has to remain limited until we develop some heard immunity. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know. Sunshine is always best cure for a better mood. Did you try to maybe walk or drive around your neighborhood for some fresh air? Oh, then drive around might be the only option. EOS 3 0 14 I' m hoping to get out and go for walks once the weather warms up, unfortunately right now there is still some snow on the ground and it' s not quite warn yet being in the northeast. EOS 3 1 15 [Others] Ye. You did the right choice. Safety is always the first concern. EOS 3 0 16 I did take walks along the path in our development last summer so the cabin fever wasn' t as bad as it seems to be with all the snow that basically kept me inside all of february. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Does where you live have a online social activity group on FB or an app called Neighbors? That could be a good way to communicate with others in a safe way. EOS 3 0 18 The local FB group is only full of everyone complaining about everyone else( seems when everyone is home things seem to get on peoples nerves more so then when people could get away from home consistently) but I' ve never heard of the app Neighbors, I' ll have to look into that. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Give that a try. Maybe you will meet some friends there. EOS 3 0 20 I will definitely have to look into that. EOS 3 1 21 [Greeting] Sounds great. I' m glad you didn' t give up seeking for solutions to make yourself feel better.
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you doing? EOS 1 0 1 Hi, I' m ok. How are you? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] Not bad, it' s a peaceful night. Anything in particular you' d like to talk about? EOS 1 0 3 That' s great. My job refused my request to continue to work from home. So I was pretty much forced to go into a school where the cases are growing. EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I imagine that' s very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being?
5 0 0 im depressed and angry. EOS 5 1 1 [Question] why would you say that? EOS 5 0 2 i really want a drink. EOS 5 1 3 [Question] is there anything I can help you with? EOS 5 0 4 i' m an alcoholic. EOS 5 1 5 [Question] do you think a drink will help you? EOS 5 0 6 Just had a stressful day. depressed because if i go get a beer i wont stop. no i guess it wouldnt. it still sucks. i want to be normal lol. i get that thought in my head and its like i become obsessed. EOS 5 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] why not try to put attention in some other things instead of a beer. EOS 5 0 8 hmmm like what? EOS 5 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] its only in your mind. EOS 5 0 10 i hate my mind. EOS 5 1 11 [Question] like working out? it will give you a lot of benefits especially with your health. you can do it! EOS 5 0 12 i actually was thinking of starting again. i did about 15 min this morning. i used to workout like 2 hours a day lol. thank you. EOS 5 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] oh that' s nice. youre welcome!
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you today? EOS 3 0 1 hi i am okay, a little bit sad though. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Okay. I am very sorry to hear that! Do you want to tell me more about that? EOS 3 0 3 Well with the holidays coming up i have been very stressed and nervous about what i am going to do. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really feel you there. Holidays are so hard.. especially with the way this year has been. Anything specific?. EOS 3 0 5 Yes. I am a college student and I live on campus. The day before I moved in my dad said some unforgivable things to me and we haven' t spoke since. I have no choice but to go live at home over the break but I am very scared about it. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Do you feel scared for your own self? Or of the situation in general? I' m sorry to hear that. Relationships with parents can be very difficult sometimes.. I' m around college age as well and also live at home. So I can understand your struggle. EOS 3 0 7 more for the situation in general. i know we will not speak but we will constantly be running into each other, my house is not big. and i have no car to escape it. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] It' s like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it' s such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you' re not positive in. I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely.. It' ll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets? EOS 3 0 9 Thank you I appreciate that. I will be fine making it over the thanksgiving break but I am more nervous about covid - 19 sending us home for good.. Not many to be honest. I have a hamster but he is at school with me so nothing at home to go back to. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like Covid - 19 is going to be a personal stressor for you. It' s such a strange thing to have to live with already, the pandemic, and i' m sorry that it might end up pushing you where you don' t want to be. Could you bring your hamster home with you? Even the smallest things could help a place feel more loving. EOS 3 0 11 Yes it is very strange and I know that it is a big stressor on all of us, i don' t want to sound selfish.. Yes i am bringing him home with me so that is my little piece of joy that is coming along. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t think you' re selfish at all. You have feelings you are entitled to have and are expressing them which is healthy and I encourage that behavior! Good! I know how hard this situation can be. Very nerve wracking. The smallest things, even a hamster, can be so beneficial. EOS 3 0 13 Well thank you that does help me to feel better. Yes I am happy to bring him home with me and hoping I can have my niece over to intro duce her to him. EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] You sound like a very determined person in making this trip as stress free as possible. I commend you for that! Maybe you could have your niece over often to play with your hamster just to soften the stress of being there.
3 1 0 [Question] Good day, how are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 Not too well. I have been depessed because of our state shut down and today an old friend from unior high school passed. EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that. I absolutely understand, it' s been hard on most people having to deal with the current state of affairs and losing people.. Do you think things will improve? EOS 3 0 3 Thank you. I know we are all in the same predicament.. I think things will improve, but not for a year or more.. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I agree. I lost a teacher some time ago and I' ve been thinking a lot about when things might improve. A year seems plausible. Since it' s so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up? EOS 3 0 5 A year is a long time when y. A year is a long time when you are 76 years old. I just want to enjoy the rest of our lives - my husband and me - and travel until we can' t enjoy it any longer. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that. It is really tough being restricted to not travelling. I call my parents( around your age) about once a week.
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? EOS 1 0 22 He' s a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly. EOS 1 0 24 But maybe I deserved it. EOS 1 1 25 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly. EOS 1 0 26 Yes, he did. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No you did not! Please don' t think like that. EOS 1 0 28 I' m just so angry that I could break something. And maybe I will do that! EOS 1 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this. EOS 1 0 30 But what if it doesn' t pass? And I cannot afford therapy. EOS 1 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now. There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free. EOS 1 0 32 I don' t know if I could do that. I don' t like talking about my problems with strangers. EOS 1 1 33 [Self-disclosure] And yet here we are: P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found.. I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that I was. EOS 1 0 34 Do you have any suggestions about how to open up to people I don' t know? EOS 1 1 35 [Others] I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No - one will be judging you.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello.:) How are you? EOS 0 0 1 I am okay. A little anxious I am feeling helpless. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am sorry to hear that. What are you feeling helpless about? EOS 0 0 3 I am worried about upcoming bills. I lost my job. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I see. I would be worried about that as well. How long have you been out of work? EOS 0 0 5 About 2 weeks. Christmas is right around the corner. I dont know how I am going to get the kids presents. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anyone you are able to ask for support right now, like your parents? I am sure they would understand, since so many people have been losing jobs lately. EOS 0 0 7 I don' t have a lot if family.. I have my sister who lives far away. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I see. And your kids are depending on you to be able to take care of them. I am so sorry; I know that must be extremely stressful. Are you married right now? If so, does your spouse have a job? EOS 0 0 9 Yes, my kids are older, yes I am married and he is working. He isnt easy to talk to.. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] I see. Do you mean that you are not on good terms with him? EOS 0 0 11 Its off and on. Some days are better than others.. I think its just the weather. Its cold. Gloomy that doesn' t help either. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I can understand that. It' s been cold and gloomy over here and my whole family has been in a bad mood. It seems like a little thing, but I find that taking Vitamin D supplements when the weather is bad helps me not to get depressed. EOS 0 0 13 I am just ready for 2021. It has been a scary year all around. Hmm, Maybe I should try that.. EOS 0 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] Yep. Me too. I' m ready for all of this mess to be over. EOS 0 0 15 Vitamins cant hurt anyone. I just hope 2021 is better for everyone. EOS 0 1 16 [Question] How important is it for you to be able to work right now? Does your husband make enough money to pay the bills and make sure you have somewhere to stay? EOS 0 0 17 Yes, it is more an independence thing. I hate having to rely on him. Our relationship is not stable. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] I can understand that. I am sorry. Was it different when your children were younger? What has changed?
3 0 0 hi im sad. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Anything particular got you down? Hello.

EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me.

0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 0 0 2 Just feeling sad. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad? EOS 0 0 4 Not being able to leave the house with Covid. plus my hours were cut at work. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut. What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time? EOS 0 0 6 Yes it sucks. I live alone now so there really hard sometimes. I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos. Nothing productive. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it' s not the same as face to face. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I have one close friend that I talk to every now and then. Its not like it use to be. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That' s still a win. EOS 0 0 10 We used to be able to go out and have a few beers together.. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. Keep that connection. It' s not going to be the same due to the circumstances. But at least you are seeking to keep that connection, and that is a good thing. EOS 0 0 12 I hope that this vaccine thing is reason and we can get back to the norm.. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it' s not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest. EOS 0 0 14 Good idea.. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well. But I am hoping they get it right, and not just rush to get something out there that may or may not work. EOS 0 0 16 I like to do home repairs. Maybe I can find a group for that. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway.
4 1 0 [Question] What is going on today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling really down about my breakup. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] \ So you have had a breakup recently and you are feeling down about it. EOS 4 0 3 Yes. I thought that it wouldn' t be terrible because I initiated it but now I regret it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] So are you doubting that you made the right decision or are you just feeling sadness at the loss you are feeling right now. EOS 4 0 5 I' m mainly doubting my decision and I know there' s nothing I can do about it. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You must have had good reason' s to have made the decision to breakup and to have initiated it. Its normal to doubt yourself afterwards. You may want to remind yourself of the reasons that you came to your decision you did. Im sure the reasons are still valid. EOS 4 0 7 I did it because I' m trying to focus on self - improvement but looking back now, there' s no reason I couldn' t have improved myself with my partner. EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up. In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single..
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus.
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Same old.. still trying to lose weight. Already on day 20 for fasting. did not lose a single pound. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight. What kind of methods have you been using? EOS 0 0 4 I tried keto diet for 6 months, didn' t work. So now on Fasting. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are really discouraged. EOS 0 0 6 I also go to gym 2 times a week. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow! You have been trying practically everything. You are really motivated. EOS 0 0 8 Yea, very discouraged... EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Losing weight can be difficult. I' ve struggled with that many times. Have you thought of consulting a dietician or a nutritionist to help? Maybe, they would offer some new suggestions. EOS 0 0 10 I am already lucky that I can sometime able to book swimming pool close by. I considered but they said I am not overweight. EOS 0 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like they didn' t listen to your needs. And it seems like you are doing a great job exercising at the pool and employing other methods to lose weight. What is your primary motivation behind your weight loss goal? EOS 0 0 12 The added weight is putting pressure on my hips and knees.. Causing a lot of pain as well for my lower back. EOS 0 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] That' s no good. I' ll bet that is difficult to deal with. Have you thought about teaming up with a friend and going on daily walks? EOS 0 0 14 No, I have to look after the kids.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, you could also take the kids on a walk every day. That would be a healthy activity to enjoy together, and it should help burn some of their energy too. EOS 0 0 16 I signed them up for swimming classes so they can exercise too. Thanks for your suggestion though. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s great! Now you can all go swimming together. Maybe that can be an activity that you all do together a couple times a week. EOS 0 0 18 I can' t join their classes. Yes, I am doing that.. EOS 0 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No, but I' m sure that there is a fitness club or city pool where you all can share your skills. EOS 0 0 20 And even after exercise, I only eat 20% of their portion and no junk food. Nice speaking to you though, you have been very kind. EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you. I enjoyed our conversation as well. Keep swimming. I' m sure you will get to where you want to be in no time. EOS 0 0 22 Thanks for your encouragement! EOS 0 1 23 [Greeting] You' re welcome!
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you feeling? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay. Thank you. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i' m okay too. EOS 0 0 4 Thats good. Do you have plans for the holidays? EOS 0 1 5 [Others] not really, i will probably just relax. what about you? EOS 0 0 6 Just hanging out at home with my husband and son. EOS 0 1 7 [Others] how' s your relationship with your family? EOS 0 0 8 It is pretty good. We all get along good. No issues. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] glad to hear so! EOS 0 0 10 How is your relationship with your family? EOS 0 1 11 [Others] it' s overly alright but i don' t really get along with my father. EOS 0 0 12 Oh i am sorry to hear that.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] don' t worry, it' s okay i am used to it. EOS 0 0 14 Has the Pandemic affected your work life at all?. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] not really i' ve always worked from home. what about you? EOS 0 0 16 Not me so much. Business was slow for quite a while because nobody was really working. But it affected my husband, because everytime anyone in our house got sick he had to leave work becase his work didnt allow anybody to be there if anybody in there household was sick.. So he missed quite a bit of work. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that must have been really terrible, i hope you all are coping with that. how did that make you feel? EOS 0 0 18 It was nerve wracking because you never knew how long he was going to be out of work for. his work changed their policy about when he could come back everytime he was out. EOS 0 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] just from talking to you i can see that it was very stressing for you. is he back to work yet? EOS 0 0 20 oh yes it defintely was. he is out again because I just tested positive for COVID. So he will be out of work for two weeks. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] is there any possibility of him getting a vaccine? he seems to be testing positive fairly often. EOS 0 0 22 He has never tested positive. I tested positive. Just anytime you get any kind of sickness his work makes you take time off just in case you have COVID. He has been tested 3 different times and it has always been negative. EOS 0 1 23 [Others] oh sorry for misunderstanding you.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 3 0 1 Hello. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, i feel like i am in depsression. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed?? EOS 3 0 5 My partner broke up with me impromptu. EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now.

I toss and turn and cannot shut my mind off. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep. Hope I get it right?

My bedtimes are kind of mixed up, maybe setting a particular schedule will help, I' ll try that. sometimes i go to be early, sometimes late, maybe that is screwing me up. EOS 1 1 11 [Self-disclosure] When I have sleeping problem, I take warm shower. It help me a lot. EOS 1 0 12 good idea, i could try that. EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] As far as I know if we follow a particular time to go to bed eventually We start feeling sleepy at that time or body adapt it.

EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work. EOS 4 0 14 Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn' t even want me to help her, no she doesn' t work. EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family. EOS 4 0 16 Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] How long has it been since she moved in. EOS 4 0 18 A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you thought about a housewarming gift. EOS 4 0 20 Hmm, no I didn' t think about that, that may be a good idea. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So just a week and she is settling in. EOS 4 0 22 Yes, but the home came furnished and honestly, I didn' t think there was that much to do, but maybe I should get a gift, to break the ice. EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Friendship is important maybe she needs to hear from you. EOS 4 0 24 Yes, it is very important, I just felt if I called I would be bothering her:( EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style. EOS 4 0 26 That is possible, and it is a HUGE house, 4 stories. EOS 4 1 27 [Question] Have you tried to visit her and see if you can help. EOS 4 0 28 No, we are not seeing each other in person due to COVID. Do you think I should try calling or texting first? EOS 4 1 29 [Reflection of feelings] sometimes people get overwhelmed and need a friend to be there. EOS 4 0 30 Yes, they certainly do, darn COVID stops everything. EOS 4 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would be a great idea, especially with the holidays. EOS 4 0 32 Would a text be more appropriate vs. a phone call? What do you think?

0 0 0 I am very worried about losing my job. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello - How are you today? EOS 0 0 2 Anxious. I think my boss wants to fire me. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so sorry you are worried about losing your job. I have been in your shoes before. Why do you think your boss wants to fire you? EOS 0 0 4 Thank you. I think if I am late again, I will be let go.. I have a sick child and my boss does not understand. How can I explain that I may be late to the office, but that I am a valuable employee?

It' s worth a shot!
6 0 0 hi my friend. EOS 6 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] Hello! How are you doing?
4 1 0 [Question] Hey there, what' s going on today? EOS 4 0 1 Hello. It is a fine day, how about yourself? EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] It really is! I am just taking in the fresh air in the backyard. EOS 4 0 3 That is awesome. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Thanks! What is going on in your neck of the woods? EOS 4 0 5 Sort of stuck inside trying to make a dime but it is alright. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Yeah great minds think alike.. do you do anything else for work? EOS 4 0 7 Looking for a good job right now. I wanted to talk about a personal issue I have been having, though. EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Okay, you know I' m here for you. Talk to me, what' s happening? EOS 4 0 9 My father and I had a fight 2 years ago and haven' t spoke since. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] The same happened to me, and then my father passed away. If there is anything I can say, is to swallow pride and cherish the moments you have on earth together. What was the fight over? EOS 4 0 11 Yeah I am afraid that these things can happen. It was only over material things. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] That was my next question, what the fight was over. Do you think he would be open to mending things? EOS 4 0 13 It is weird because I called him out for being manipulative so this is his defense.. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Usually when people feel singled out, they only have a few mechanisms. Unfortunately, most people tend to run away instead of fixing things. It tends to be the easier option. EOS 4 0 15 I would likely take advantage of an opportunity to be the bigger person. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] When you try to fix things, just remember that this is his method. I wouldn' t hold back on what you have to say, but just word it so that he doesn' t feel the need to flee. EOS 4 0 17 That is probably decent advice. EOS 4 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is HIS responsibility as a parent to want to fix things, but you are also being the bigger person here. I applaud you and hope that he is receptive. EOS 4 0 19 I hope so too, but the opportunity seems tenuous. EOS 4 1 20 [Question] How did you guys leave it? EOS 4 0 21 Threatening and disparagement haha. EOS 4 1 22 [Question] Ha, well after two years, feelings had to have changed. Even a little. Does he live nearby?
3 0 0 I' m so depressed, I just got layed off. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I am sorry to hear that, did you apply for unemployment benefit? That at least can help you financially until you get a new job. EOS 3 0 2 Yes, it will take weeks and the holidays are just around the corner. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sucks it happens so close to the holidays. I understand it' s hard to accept but I' d recommend talking with someone close to you like a friend and family member. EOS 3 0 4 I know, with all the other crap going on now everyone else has their own problems they don' t want to hear mine. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure someone will be there for you, they know you need them the most right now. If you don' t feel comfortable talking to them, you can seek online therapist. There are a lot of free service for mental car. EOS 3 0 6 They' re busy with other people' s problems. I' ll deal with it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It' s not gonna be easy, but at the same time not impossible. Try looking at it a different way. You can use this time to train your skills or do things that you' ve wanted to but didn' t have the time. EOS 3 0 8 I wanted to travel but that' s not a good idea right now. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] You can still travel domestically or just around your city. I like taking a walk in the park or wandering downtown to clear my mind. EOS 3 0 10 I live in a small town and were are suppose to self quarantine unless we have to leave the house for work or go to the store. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] that really sucks. Do you have a garden at home? In the mean time, try following youtube or other channels to work out, it helps you distract from current issue and also makes you healthier. A healthy body is needed for a healthy mind.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 I am fine thank you. How are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am very well. Do you have any problems you' d like to discuss with me? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I am having trouble figuring out how to handel a situation with a friend. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah, can you give me a few more details? I am sure I will be able to help/ EOS 0 0 5 Her husband was justshot and kiled over a drug deal. He was high on drugs at the time. My dayghter and his daughter are good friends and we carpool with them every day. He was often the driver not my friend. Was he high when he was driving my daughter arround? Did my friend know he was on drugs? EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow that is a tough one - I can see why you would be concerned about it. At least, though, you can be assured that she is safe and is never going to come to any harm as a result of his driving now. EOS 0 0 7 Agreed but it is hard to not be suspicious that the mom knew something about hi actions. Yet I feel horrible that she lost her husband. EOS 0 1 8 [Others] I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it:(
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Somewhat stressed but otherwise ok. How about you? EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I am great, it snowed and looks like Christmas here. Why are you so stressed? EOS 0 0 4 I' m developing romantic feelings for a friend but she doesn' t share those feelings with me in return. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. I have been there myself.. Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend?
7 0 0 Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well. EOS 7 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well I can help you study if you' d like? EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material... EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study! EOS 7 0 4 My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted. EOS 7 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version. EOS 7 0 6 Wow, that' s actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me. EOS 7 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot. EOS 7 0 8 That is true. I will reach out to her now. EOS 7 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will do just fine, you can do it! EOS 7 0 10 I still have some self - doubt given that I have failed an exam in the past... EOS 7 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, is there anything I can help you with today? EOS 4 0 1 I am really depressed because of my recent break up. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Oh no, that is really sad. I know break ups can be very hard.. EOS 4 0 3 yeah. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel you are depressed about it? Were you together a long time? EOS 4 0 5 i was with her for more then 2 years and without her everthing seems incomplete. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I completely understand. I have had break ups too. They are never easy. EOS 4 0 7 what should i do now? EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Well, if the break up is still fresh, it will take some time before you start feeling yourself again. Breaking up with someone can be as devastating as a death. Because you mourn the loss of the person. What do you think you could do to help yourself feel better? EOS 4 0 9 that is very true. what i need right now is to distract my mind and think about something else. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] What kind of hobbies do you have? Or are you involved in sports or any type of other activities that you enjoy? EOS 4 0 11 i mostly play soccer. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That could be a great distraction. You could start practicing soccer again. You definitely have more time for it now. Do you have anyone you can talk to about the break up? Sometimes talking with a close friend or family member can help a lot too. EOS 4 0 13 I have my best friend and he is also helping me recover but my main issue is inner will power. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] Why do you say that? Are you focused on trying to get back with them?

It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how?
3 0 0 Hi, how' s your day going? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello. Im doing good. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 2 Not so good unfortunately. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why. Can you talknto me about it? EOS 3 0 4 Due to this pandemic, I am fearful for my job security and future in general. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how are you feeling. Its not that easy going through this pandemic. EOS 3 0 6 There is currently a lock down in my area. It seems like things are getting worse. My anxiety is high. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how are you feeling. Im kind of going in the same situation. But you have to keep calm. You have to look things at this way, maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home. I believe God put us in this situation to appreciate more our surroundings.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you today? EOS 3 0 1 hi i am okay, a little bit sad though. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Okay. I am very sorry to hear that! Do you want to tell me more about that? EOS 3 0 3 Well with the holidays coming up i have been very stressed and nervous about what i am going to do. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really feel you there. Holidays are so hard.. especially with the way this year has been. Anything specific?. EOS 3 0 5 Yes. I am a college student and I live on campus. The day before I moved in my dad said some unforgivable things to me and we haven' t spoke since. I have no choice but to go live at home over the break but I am very scared about it. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Do you feel scared for your own self? Or of the situation in general? I' m sorry to hear that. Relationships with parents can be very difficult sometimes.. I' m around college age as well and also live at home. So I can understand your struggle. EOS 3 0 7 more for the situation in general. i know we will not speak but we will constantly be running into each other, my house is not big. and i have no car to escape it. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] It' s like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it' s such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you' re not positive in. I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely.. It' ll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 3 0 1 Hello. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, i feel like i am in depsression. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed?? EOS 3 0 5 My partner broke up with me impromptu. EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now. EOS 3 0 7 Exactly, that is my current situation. I feel like my entire life has been rearranged. How did you deal with them and specifically what was your coping mechanism? EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days. I slowly realised that i had put myself in slow motion and then slowly started to do things i used to do to maybe come out of it. EOS 3 0 9 True, what ways would you suggest i use to approach my situation and get out of this state? It is very pathetic really when you think of it, halting all your life activities and plans just because a relationship ended. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well i had a close friend that i was able to vent to and help me see what was important. Do you have anyone close in your life you could talk to for guidance? EOS 3 0 11 Close friends can really be helpful in such situations. Yes, i do have a close friend even though i am very poor when it comes to opening up. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see what you mean about pathetic lol. But rather than see yourself as pathetic in a negative, use that defiance to push yourself back out into the world. Start slowly with opening up, maybe even tell your friend you intent and ask them to be patient as you learn to better express your inner feelings. EOS 3 0 13 Yes, i should do that because at the end of it all i still have myself to take care of. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think youre already on the right track. I just know you can get back to you! EOS 3 0 15 Opening up is a skill that i could do better at because i have never been the open type. But with a little practice i could get better at it. I have to get better no matter what. Are there other tactics you can share with me with regards to my current situation? EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are resources online that perhaps you could look into to help with expressing yourself. EOS 3 0 17 Is there any particular resource you can refer me to? EOS 3 1 18 [Others] Yes just a moment. EOS 3 0 19 Waiting, thank you. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I was going to send you a few links but it wont let me. EOS 3 0 21 Ooh too bad. Could you just name a few then i can look them up on my own later? EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] instead try googling the phrase" how to open up to others" and there should be a few sites with tips and references. EOS 3 0 23 Ok that' s rather helpful. EOS 3 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] healthyplace. com has a good article. EOS 3 0 25 Will definitely check it out. EOS 3 1 26 [Others] Im hope that i have been able to help at least a little bit.

EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Is living with your brother a bad thing? What specifically is making you upset? EOS 3 0 4 yes it is. he acts like a azz most of the time. he dosent care about anyone but himself. just like his fiancé. he throws away the bills and expects me to pay to keep the utilities on when they are about to be disconnected. then tells me i dont contribute to the house.. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems like he would be a very difficult person to live with. And that is hard for you obviously.

EOS 4 0 18 maybe overwatch. i haven' t been playing them much. EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] i' m wondering: are you a reader? do you enjoy reading? i' m asking because i find when i read a good book, time seems to move very quickly. EOS 4 0 20 i am. but i have a hard time focusing as of late. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can make a goal of reading a few pages and then see if you can build on that. then, if you want, you can make a goal of reading a chapter.

EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Im sorry but we do not get those promps. We just get to talk pretty much, we have to find out whats going on. You are not interrupting anything. EOS 0 0 6 Here! Last Christmas I bought the condo of my dreams. This April 2020 I lost my job due Covid 19. My unemployment is ending and my savings are depleted. I' ve recived an eviction notice and don' t know what to do. Help! Have you ever been evicted? EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Where are you that you are able to be evicted? You should not be able to be evicted from your home during this time in pretty much every state. Have you tried contacting anyone for help other than your landlord? EOS 0 0 8 I' m still in my condo but I no longer have a job, umemployment has run out and my savings are all gone. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well the plus side is they cannot kick you out right now. Have you talk to your landlord about working out some payment arrangement. Have you tried applying for any job? Now is not the time for pride to get in the way, i would accept anything. EOS 0 0 10 When you say work out a plan what do you mean? I have no job. I have been applying for jobs but I haven' t received a callback or an offer of employment. Have you ever been in this situation? Also, I' m calling a helpline so Pride is not my issue. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different. I am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass. I was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures. They could work out a way you can pay extra monthly when you get back on your feet.
0 0 0 Hi. Is anyone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hi there. EOS 0 0 2 Hi I thought you were not going to show. my anxiety level just increased while I was waiting for you. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Apologies, I have had issues with my connection which should now be resolved. How can I help you today. EOS 0 0 4 I am having a panic attack. I have to come up with 100 by next week to meet my minimum charge. on my credit card. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you need to find 100, have limited time to do this and this is causing you anxiety as a result? EOS 0 0 6 yes it sure is. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, I can tell you are really worried about this and want to find a way to remove the pressure from this situation.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 I' m sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What happened? EOS 4 0 3 My ex - boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Why did he break up with you? EOS 4 0 5 because I didn' t trust him and I was always jelous. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think you should try finding a psychologist to help your jealous. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I think so, because I should not feel like that, I should trust him. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Apparently psychologist is good for people who want to share feelings and emotions. EOS 4 0 9 Yes, it' s true. Thanks for the information. I' m trying not to talk to him or think about him, because I feel better. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s good for you to do that. You' ll feel better with time. EOS 4 0 11 But it' s so hard do to that. I spend a lot of time with him. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I feel the same way. When it had happened with me. However, I talked it with my friends and family and made me feel much better. EOS 4 0 13 Yes. I' ll do it. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You should spend time for yourself now. Take care of yourself. EOS 4 0 15 Yes, I' m going to do that. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I Know that in the beginning it' s so difficult to do anything, you just want to sleep and do nothing, but with time you' ll feel much better and try start over. EOS 4 0 17 Yes, it' s true. For now, I' ll just cry and sleep. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes. you should do that. It' s not good to hold crying. You should just do what you want to do now. EOS 4 0 19 Yes, thank you. EOS 4 1 20 [Others] If you need anything later, just text me.
5 1 0 [Question] Hi there. How are you today? EOS 5 0 1 I' m good. how r u? EOS 5 1 2 [Question] I' m doing good today. What brings you on here? EOS 5 0 3 I' m not happy with an ex friend who talks behind my back to my current friends. EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] ugh. There' s nothing worse than that. Have you confronted the ex friend? EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking. EOS 5 1 6 [Question] oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it? EOS 5 0 7 they' re still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander. EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s an option but I hope it doesn' t go that far again. Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend? EOS 5 0 9 no. i don' t want anything to do with her. if i find out my friends take her side they will be my ex friend too. EOS 5 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand that. You don' t want two people disrespecting you.. EOS 5 0 11 absolutely not. i have a strong constitution about myself and don' t allow to be disrespected by anyone. EOS 5 1 12 [Question] I hear that! What happened in court when you went? If you don' t mind me asking. EOS 5 0 13 i tried to get an order for her to stay away from me. the first judge passed it but the second judge said it wasn' t strong enough.. EOS 5 1 14 [Question] Sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can. Has she been in contact with you? EOS 5 0 15 no. she hasn' t done anything lately for me to get a court order. if she starts anything again i will get a lawyer and sue her. EOS 5 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Seems like a good idea. Steer clear of her and don' t associate with her! Sounds like you' re doing the right thing. Keep your side of the street clean. EOS 5 0 17 absolutely will avoid her. if she ever convinces my friends should i tell them i don' t want to associate with them anymore? EOS 5 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would if I were in your shoes. You don' t need two of the same person. Know what I mean? EOS 5 0 19 yeah exactly. people need to realize who' s side to stay on. EOS 5 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] LOL if only everyone had that thought process. Some people don' t get it! EOS 5 0 21 it' s easier said than done. a lot of people are afraid of being alone and will put up with garbage. EOS 5 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Definitely sounds like you have the right tools and mindset to do the right thing! I know about the alone thing especially in these times. EOS 5 0 23 yeah it sucks lol. EOS 5 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Take those tools you have, steer clear of her and do your own thing! EOS 5 0 25 i will. thank you for your advice. EOS 5 1 26 [Others] Most definitely. I wish you the best. If you every wanna chat again just stop on by! EOS 5 0 27 thank ya! Likewise. EOS 5 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Take care!
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, how are you today?
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? EOS 1 0 22 He' s a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly. EOS 1 0 24 But maybe I deserved it. EOS 1 1 25 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly. EOS 1 0 26 Yes, he did. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No you did not! Please don' t think like that. EOS 1 0 28 I' m just so angry that I could break something. And maybe I will do that! EOS 1 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this.
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that? EOS 0 0 21 being on the board gives me perks. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit? EOS 0 0 23 yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there' s an element of mutual manipulation. EOS 0 0 25 yes. EOS 0 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are definitely not the only person to feel this way! EOS 0 0 27 it' s a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power.. what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board. EOS 0 0 29 i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment. EOS 0 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] But that is rather manipulative of you. EOS 0 0 31 if you were me you would forget about him and the board. EOS 0 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I definitely would do that. EOS 0 0 33 thing is he is encouraging me to be like that. cuz it helps him too. okay. i' ll try to lay low and walk away from it. EOS 0 1 34 [Others] I think it' s time for a clear severance. Do you have any other people you are interested in? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 35 yes but it' s less than before cuz of Covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this - if that makes sense. EOS 0 1 36 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah I hear you. You feel that your options are rather more limited than previously because of the lockdown? EOS 0 0 37 yes. EOS 0 1 38 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is something I believe that most of us are feeling right now so I sympathise. EOS 0 0 39 true. i just have to be strong about it with him. even if he likes me i don' t think it' s a healthy relationship. i slept with one of his friends and the other one wanted to sleep with me too. EOS 0 1 40 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be. Is he aware that this happened? EOS 0 0 41 yes when it comes down to it. he suspected it happened. his friend asked the one i slept with if it was true. he denied it. so i think he suspected it. EOS 0 1 42 [Question] Do you feel guilty about this? EOS 0 0 43 now that im talking to him i do a little. it felt good at the time like i was getting back at him. you can tell this is a very twisted situation. EOS 0 1 44 [Question] Do you feel that you want to get revenge on him?
6 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 1 Hi there. Can you help me? EOS 6 1 2 [Question] What help you need? please can you explain. EOS 6 0 3 I did not study for a test and I very poorly. I feel ashamed! EOS 6 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] please don' t feel shame you can do it. nothing is hard if we try. EOS 6 0 5 Exactly. I did not try! EOS 6 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] so please try then you feel better. where you feel stuck in studies please can you explain. EOS 6 0 7 I just don' t feel motivated to study. EOS 6 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] from today please feel yourself that you know everything about your studies, i think then you fell better. EOS 6 0 9 ok I will do that. Thank you. EOS 6 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] give more time to your study then you know everything about your studies. EOS 6 0 11 I will! I need to put some effort in for sure. EOS 6 1 12 [Others] yes you can do it. just try. EOS 6 0 13 Ok I will try. I think the problem is not trying for sure. EOS 6 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] so start from today then tomorrow is better day. EOS 6 0 15 great advice. thank you! EOS 6 1 16 [Greeting] your welcome. EOS 6 0 17 I think that' s all. I feel better now. I' ll try more. EOS 6 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] i face this situation long time ago i try my best and then i come out easily because i try my best.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you. EOS 3 0 1 Not doing well. I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Oh no, how long had you been together? EOS 3 0 3 we were together for 2 years. It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Wow, that' s horrible. How do you feel about it? EOS 3 0 5 I feel lost. I' m so used to her being around everyday. Now I don' t know what to do with myself without her. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year. EOS 3 0 7 Not only that, but with Covid going on I have noone i can see to talk about it. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have any family? EOS 3 0 9 Yes, i do, but they are far away. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Friends closeby? Hobbies? What kind of work do you do? EOS 3 0 11 I do have friends, who are also friends with her. However they have families and do not visit prople because of covid. I don' t have any true hobbies. I don' t think they will fill the void anyways. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow. EOS 3 0 13 I do software development, but its a work at home situation. So i have been just by myself for the last week, and its driving me crazy. All i do is think about why she would do that. I' ve had time to myself but its not getting any better. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have always tried to think of things in a positive way. This way even when something really bad happens, it doesn' t seem so bad as to overwhelm us from recovering. EOS 3 0 15 What positive are there here? EOS 3 1 16 [Question] I' m actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it? Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren' t hurting for money.
4 0 0 I feel sad, and feel like need help. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you identify why you feel sad? EOS 4 0 2 yes, my aunt pass away a couple weeks ago. and since then im feeling really sad. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is natural to feel sad when someone you care about dies. EOS 4 0 4 IS there something I can do to feel better? EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are you with family? Sometimes it helps to be with others who are grieving? EOS 4 0 6 No, I live alone, my family lives in another state. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being by yourself is rough after a death. Can you talk with your family by phone? Do you have a friend who has gone through a similar loss? EOS 4 0 8 I feel like everybody is in their own bussines and have no time to hear my complains. I talk to my family, but the whole family is not doing really fine. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you feel people think you are complaining when you talk about your Aunt' s death making you sad. Is that correct?
0 0 0 Hi how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I' m doing fine, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 Doing ok, thanks. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] thats good what do you have planned for the holidays?

EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I completely understand that i feel that pain as well. are you there? EOS 0 0 6 oh I am sorry to hear that. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s ok there are plenty of other things that you can do with family during this time. EOS 0 0 8 Thats true that should be the holiday spirit and keep hope alive. EOS 0 1 9 [Question] exactly so what else do you have planned are you ready for the new year?

EOS 3 1 5 [Question] How have you been able to get by? EOS 3 0 6 i am on social assiatnce but its not enough and i feel so worthless. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If you keep trying things will work out in the end. EOS 3 0 8 but i have been tryin for so long, i dont know what ti do. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Perhaps you havent searched well enough, have you gone to many interviews? EOS 3 0 10 yes I did do a lot of interveiws but no one hired me. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps on the interviews you are doing something wrong, because it have been a while. EOS 3 0 12 i feel that i am not worthy and that no one thinks i am capable. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Dont think that. You are worthy, you just need to apply yourself in the right direction:) EOS 3 0 14 how can i do this. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps look for any job for now, even if they wage isn' t good, because you have to start with something. You need some work experience. EOS 3 0 16 i get depressed when i am rejected every time. EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it happens that you get rejected, but it is the opportunity to learn from your mistakes and go again:) EOS 3 0 18 do you have any tools that can help manage my depression. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try meditation as it is able to help you relax and assess your situation.
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 1 0 1 I could be better. How about U? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] I am doing well. Whats bothering you? EOS 1 0 3 A friend screwed me out of money and a business venture. I am no longer friends with her. We were really close before this.. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! I am so sorry that has happened to you. That must feel like such a betrayal. Can you tell me more about it? EOS 1 0 5 It does. I' ve known her for 14 years and we dated. I invested a lot of money in a business she wanted to do. She took the money and ran. EOS 1 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back. EOS 1 0 7 What do you suggest? EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Did you sign anything? or have proof of what happened? EOS 1 0 9 No. Other than the money I transferred to her. Hello? EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What was the business? It depends on your location but I' m sure just on the transaction alone that shows some kind of intent. or text messages saying it was for a specific purpose? EOS 1 0 11 A cat cafe. Where you can hang out and work or drink with adoptable cats from the local shelter.. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you gave her a large amount of money and have any kind of messages about it I would look into trying to get it back. EOS 1 0 13 I gave her 80K. No messages. It was all done in person. Do you think I should get a lawyer and call the cops? EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would seek the advice of a lawyer. I' m sorry this has happened thats horrible. EOS 1 0 15 It is. I don' t want to go to the police. I think they are all corrupt and raciest. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would say 80K is worth speaking to a lawyer about it. I' m sorry you are so conflicted. I would not call the police because you willingly gave it to her. I would hire a lawyer to handle it. EOS 1 0 17 That' s great advice. I will do that. I have a mutual friend that is a lawyer. EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would not talk to a mutual friend about this at all....
1 0 0 hi there. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hi! Hope you are doing well. How can I help you today? EOS 1 0 2 I am having such a hard time falling asleep at night....

4 0 0 Hello. Is anyone there. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you today? EOS 4 0 2 I' m doing good. I need some advice. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] What can I help you with? EOS 4 0 4 Lately, my friends started to make jokes about my face being ugly. They even called my face as flat as a pan! What should I do? I see them everyday on the bus. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried confronting them and asking why they are being bullies? EOS 4 0 6 I did and they respond by saying that they are just joking and that I' m handsome. But it' s starting to get on my nerves because it' s all they make fun about every time they see me! EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you are very handsome! They could just be jealous. EOS 4 0 8 Haha I would hope so. Still though, it makes me want to avoid them when I go to school on the bus. What do you think I should do then? EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I understand, school was tough for me too. I suggest you tell them to knock it off or you can sit somewhere away from the bus. EOS 4 0 10 Should I just beat them up with my backpack. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No, beating them up will only get you in trouble and that won' t help. EOS 4 0 12 There' s another bus route. Should I just take that instead. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that could be a good idea if it' s not too far out of your way. EOS 4 0 14 I think I will. Their comments make me very insecure. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could also tell a teacher what is happening. They will help you out. I bet you are handsome! Don' t let it get to you. EOS 4 0 16 The teacher would probably make fun of me!. Thanks it' s hard to look in the mirror now. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try to tell yourself you are good looking and deserve good things to happen every morning! Look in that mirror and tell yourself good things.

EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is natural to feel sad when someone you care about dies. EOS 4 0 4 IS there something I can do to feel better? EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are you with family? Sometimes it helps to be with others who are grieving? EOS 4 0 6 No, I live alone, my family lives in another state. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being by yourself is rough after a death. Can you talk with your family by phone? Do you have a friend who has gone through a similar loss? EOS 4 0 8 I feel like everybody is in their own bussines and have no time to hear my complains. I talk to my family, but the whole family is not doing really fine. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you feel people think you are complaining when you talk about your Aunt' s death making you sad. Is that correct? EOS 4 0 10 yes. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Do you feel you are complaining? EOS 4 0 12 yes, I feel like noone wants to listen. I need to do something by mnyself. Can you recommend someting for me to do to feel better? EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] My own experiences with family deaths is they are sad. I just wanted to" feel better". My experience was it did not help to complain about" being sad" but it did help to talk about why I missed my family member. If no one was available, sometimes I would journal. Do you think that might help you? EOS 4 0 14 Well maybe it could works, to mantain distracted. thank you. EOS 4 1 15 [Greeting] You are welcome. I am sorry about your Aunt. EOS 4 0 16 Thnak you, I think it helps to have someone to chat. Makes me feel better to chat a bit with you, helped me to relax. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] That is why I am here.

4 0 0 I face the situation of me being sad because I thought we could let this fight go over time but instead it has lead to us breaking up. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about the fight?
0 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hai. EOS 0 0 1 Hey. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How are you friend? Where are you from? EOS 0 0 3 Okay i guess. North Carolina. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] ok, EOS 0 0 5 What about you? EOS 0 1 6 [Question] What are you doing? i am john from, new york. EOS 0 0 7 Watching tom and jerry with my kids.

1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? EOS 1 0 22 He' s a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly. EOS 1 0 24 But maybe I deserved it. EOS 1 1 25 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly. EOS 1 0 26 Yes, he did. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No you did not! Please don' t think like that. EOS 1 0 28 I' m just so angry that I could break something. And maybe I will do that! EOS 1 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this. EOS 1 0 30 But what if it doesn' t pass? And I cannot afford therapy. EOS 1 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now. There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free. EOS 1 0 32 I don' t know if I could do that. I don' t like talking about my problems with strangers. EOS 1 1 33 [Self-disclosure] And yet here we are: P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found.. I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that I was. EOS 1 0 34 Do you have any suggestions about how to open up to people I don' t know? EOS 1 1 35 [Others] I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No - one will be judging you. EOS 1 0 36 That' s what I am afraid of. Being judged by people. EOS 1 1 37 [Question] Do you think that this might partly because your ex has eroded your self esteem?. EOS 1 0 38 Probably. He called me a lot of names. EOS 1 1 39 [Others] The important thing is to gradually rebuild your self esteem. Do you have any things that you excel at?. EOS 1 0 40 I' m good at bowling. And I like riding horses. EOS 1 1 41 [Others] Animals are a wonderful source of comfort when we are feeling very low! Could you join a riding club to make some new friends?
3 0 0 hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 i am ok so far. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 4 i am depressed. and need some inspiration. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression?
2 0 0 Good evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hi, how' s things? EOS 2 0 2 Things are ok I am just having issues with the problem above. EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I am afraid that I am not able to see that.. can you tell me about it? EOS 2 0 4 Yes, so I have always done very well in school and university. I have always had A' s or high B' s. Last semester in university, I failed one of my exams. I still passed the class with an A, but for some reason, that exam haunts me and gives me bad dreams. I don' t know why it happens and it worries me. EOS 2 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - when I was sitting my final exams I constantly had nightmares about failing. Nearly thirty years on and I still do!! But - you did really very well and you passed with an A. Do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself? EOS 2 0 6 Maybe, I got a 46% on the exam( so an F) but I did all my other assignments and exams almost perfect and got an A overall. I never once failed a test in my life, and have always held myself to a very high academic degree to make my parents proud. I come from a poor family, so succeeding in life is very important to m, e. me* EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds as though you feel that academic success is the most important thing in your life, would I be right in thinking this? EOS 2 0 8 Yes you are correct. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered talking to anyone about these feelings of perfectionism? A therapist perhaps? There is a good deal of useful help and information out there for people who are struggling. EOS 2 0 10 I have not, actually. I don' t think my family can afford a therapist, especially with the pandemic raging right now. Where do you recommend going? EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Does your school have any counsellors offering help for free? Many do. I believe that there are some charities that will offer a certain number of free therapy sessions too. EOS 2 0 12 I don' t think any are available since my school is online only, also the campus i s completely closed due to Winter Break. Oh? Charities? EOS 2 1 13 [Others] Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you.
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 6 0 1 hi. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing? EOS 6 0 3 Well I' m distraught. EOS 6 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel that way? EOS 6 0 5 Because my girlfriend has left me. EOS 6 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard for you. I haven' t personally had to deal with that, but I have had friends that have. How long were you together? EOS 6 0 7 four years. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being together that long must have made that break up difficult. How are you coping with it? EOS 6 0 9 well I' m not really, especially as she' d gone off with someone else. But I' m to blame which makes it worse. EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened? EOS 6 0 11 I cheated on her on a drunken night. It was a one - off and I regret it terribly. But she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain. EOS 6 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I see how she would be upset. It must be difficult for you though because she didn' t give you another chance. Do you have someone to talk to about your feelings? EOS 6 0 13 yeah, I' m not saying I deserved it just wish she had. But no, not really. No - one who would understand. EOS 6 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I would have wanted a second chance too if I were in your shoes. Is this affecting you really bad? EOS 6 0 15 Yeah I feel so low. EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If your mood is affecting your daily activities, normally that means your mental health has been affected. You could always talk to a professional if it' s hard for you. EOS 6 0 17 it' s difficult though, to open up. EOS 6 1 18 [Self-disclosure] It is. But trust me, it really helps. I' ve been seeing a therapist recently actually and I love it. I don' t have to worry about judgement at all. It' s a hard step but worth it in the end.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello. EOS 2 0 1 Hello I am in need of assistance. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] I am Tom. How can I help you? How are you in need of assistance? EOS 2 0 3 Hello Tom, this is Dillon..

Are you in a trade school? Or in academia? EOS 2 0 5 In college. I started off really well until the pandemic hit. Now my family is struggling financially and it has greatly affected my academics.

EOS 2 0 7 What kind of jobs did you take? EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Work part - time and go to school part - time.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that?

4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am very sorry to hear that. What are you sad about? EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently? EOS 4 0 5 It is over permanently... EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah I guess, the relationship was a little toxic and she sometimes only used me for money. Maybe is it for the best now that I think about it. EOS 4 1 8 [Others] Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!! EOS 4 0 9 Yeah I just miss having someone there for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] All you need now is to give yourself some TLC.. treat yourself to something nice and go easy on yourself. EOS 4 0 11 What is TLC. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] There will be someone else. I never thought I' d find anyone else but I did and we' ve been together ten years ago now! Tender Loving Care:) Means be good to yourself. EOS 4 0 13 Ok yeah your story is very inspirational to me. Maybe this was needed in order to find the right person. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anything you can do to distract yourself right now? Plan a holiday or take a night class or something? EOS 4 0 15 I am now doing mturk to get my mind off of it to make some extra money. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Save up what you make and buy yourself something nice? EOS 4 0 17 yeah the only problem is I am barely getting any money from this. Do you have any tips onto how I can make more money/ EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There is some very lucrative stuff out there:). Take what we are doing right now for instance. EOS 4 0 19 I mean 15 minutes for 2$ doesn' t seem very lucrative. but I guess it ads up. EOS 4 1 20 [Question] beats flipping burgers;). So, what are you going to do to get yourself back onto the dating market? EOS 4 0 21 I am going to wait for this whole covid thing to end and then get a real job and once I fix my financial situation I will start dating again. EOS 4 1 22 [Others] Ah yes, the world feels like it' s on hold at the moment doesn' t it? Probably not a good time to start sharing germs with new people: D. EOS 4 0 23 Yeah exactly and I have more pressing matters at hand than a girlfriend because like I said, I am in need of money right now since. EOS 4 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' ll be around for ages if you want to talk some more on here!

1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you doing? EOS 1 0 1 Hi, I' m ok. How are you? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] Not bad, it' s a peaceful night. Anything in particular you' d like to talk about? EOS 1 0 3 That' s great. My job refused my request to continue to work from home. So I was pretty much forced to go into a school where the cases are growing. EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I imagine that' s very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being? EOS 1 0 5 Just to make sure I' m wearing my mask, washing my hands, and social distancing. Which is not enough. There are more and more teachers getting infected and I just feel it a matter of time before it my turn.. I fear that I will bring this home to my family and I will not survive it. I have pre existing conditions. EOS 1 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry that you' re having to deal with such stressful circumstances. You can only control what you can control. Have you discussed these concerns with the school and explained the preexisting conditions? I get it though. It' s scary for everyone at this point. EOS 1 0 7 Yes I have explained to my principal, my team, and got a note from my Rheumatologist. EOS 1 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems to me that they should take that information into consideration. EOS 1 0 9 I feel that way too. I was told it for the best interest of the school that I am there I do not have student in my classroom but I' m forced to help out around the school with students and staff. Teachers are not cared about its just about pleasing the parents it crazy. I can' t quit because there not much to go into now. EOS 1 1 10 [Question] Is there someone else you could go to about this? Besides whoever you' ve already attempted to discuss it with? Yeah you' re right. Covid has been a mess for everyone and affected us in so many ways that e could' ve never prepared for. EOS 1 0 11 I' ve tried contacting HR a few times but I have never received a call back, or my emails answered. EOS 1 1 12 [Others] I mean all you can do is try your best to stay safe but I would continue to reach out to people higher up and see about getting something done. They probably get a lot of calls and emails right now because of everything going on but I would keep trying. EOS 1 0 13 Very true. I' m going to keep trying. Thanks for talking with me letting out what I feel has made me feel a little better. EOS 1 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Thank you for talking with me too! I hope it has helped some. At least you know you' re not alone... EOS 1 0 15 It really did help I feel a bit lighter. Thank you again. EOS 1 1 16 [Greeting] You' re welcome. I wish you the best and many blessings.
3 0 0 Hi, how' s your day going? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello. Im doing good. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 2 Not so good unfortunately. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why. Can you talknto me about it? EOS 3 0 4 Due to this pandemic, I am fearful for my job security and future in general. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how are you feeling. Its not that easy going through this pandemic. EOS 3 0 6 There is currently a lock down in my area. It seems like things are getting worse. My anxiety is high. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how are you feeling. Im kind of going in the same situation. But you have to keep calm. You have to look things at this way, maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home. I believe God put us in this situation to appreciate more our surroundings. EOS 3 0 8 I doubt it will get better, but thanks for the positive vibes. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you ever try to talk to your love one at home? Or maybe take time to communicate more with your friends? EOS 3 0 10 No, but I' ve been taking medication for my depression. Any suggestion on activities to help me past time? EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Well i dont know when this is going to end but if we let this isolation win the we are going to get worse. So I would recommend to share time with your love one and clear your mind and take out all the negative things away. Right now Im talking a lot with my brother and me and him never get along. So this is a huge step. EOS 3 0 12 That is great to hear. I wish I had someone I can talk to. Now I feel even more depressed. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Another thing i can recomend is try to read some books. That will help. I dont like reading but Im doing it and sometimes by doing it relaxed me and get me to another place.

I hope the pandemic will end. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all?
3 0 0 Hi, how' s your day going? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello. Im doing good. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 2 Not so good unfortunately. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why. Can you talknto me about it? EOS 3 0 4 Due to this pandemic, I am fearful for my job security and future in general. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how are you feeling. Its not that easy going through this pandemic.
3 0 0 Hello, I' ve been really depressed lately and feel like there isn' t anything I can do to break this feeling. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened? EOS 3 0 2 November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS( its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 4 Yes that is correct. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest.
4 0 0 Hi I am so sad my boyfriend was cheating and broke up with me when I found out. I don' t think I can ever be happy again. EOS 4 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self - esteem is that true? EOS 4 0 2 I have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. I have lost interest in everything I can barely make myself go to work. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better? EOS 4 0 4 Maybe, why would he cheat? I have seen her she is not that pretty. I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination. EOS 4 1 5 [Others] remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren' t right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else. EOS 4 0 6 I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn' t want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn' t mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that. EOS 4 0 8 I trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. I thought we were so perfect together, I don' t want him back I could never trust him again, I am not sure I could trust any guy right now, I am so hurt and confused. I don' t ever want to feel like this again. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] relationship issues, especially when they and suddenly can be one of the most stressful periods in an adults life. you are not alone in that other people have been through similar experiences themselves. EOS 4 0 10 This was the first guy I ever lived with, I thought we would get married one day. How do people make it through the pain, it actually hurts. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, what brings you to seek support, today? EOS 4 0 1 I am having ongoing depression. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin? EOS 4 0 3 I have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It first began a couple of weeks ago. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I am sad and anxious about the coronavirus. I miss seeing my friends and family. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you must really care about your friends and family, and this awful pandemic is prevent your from seeing them. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, definitely. I hope the pandemic will end. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all? EOS 4 0 9 I haven' t thought about dying at all. I take medication each day for my depression, but there are times when I still feel sad. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay, thanks for sharing that personal information. I only ask because thoughts of suicide are normal and anxiety and depression increase the chances of suicide. EOS 4 0 11 You' re welcome. I understand, but I am not suicidal. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] What would you like to talk about, then? We could talk about the problem more, or if you feel like it is defined, we could talk about solutions, or not talk about solutions at all. What would make you feel better? EOS 4 0 13 I would like to talk about solutions since I feel like the problem is defined. EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I know what it is like to be depressed. I also take medication for this. For solutions, studies show that working out and exercising can help depression. Have you considered this? EOS 4 0 15 Yes, I enjoy taking walks and doing a cardio workout at home. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] That' s great! What ways do you think you could communicate more with your family? EOS 4 0 17 I could communicate more with my family by calling them on the phone, texting, emailing, or talking to them on Zoom. EOS 4 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You listed a lot of good solutions such as zoom and texting. Do you think doing that would make you feel less depressed? EOS 4 0 19 Yes, I think that Zoom and texting would make me feel less depressed. EOS 4 1 20 [Others] Well, let me ask you this. I noticed that you had many solutions off - hand that you could tell me, and you also said it could help you with your depression. May I ask what is keeping you from using these methods?

EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure that whatever happens, you will do well with them. Have you thought about talking to an administrator at your school? EOS 1 0 8 I hope so. But I feel like this could have been handled better. Not yet, there is a waiting list to talk to an academic advisor. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is all the more reason to be frustrated, i commend you for having to deal with that! EOS 1 0 10 Thanks. I feel like my head is going to explode though. The remainder of the semester is going to be online. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about talking to a close friend or someone you trust about these stressors? EOS 1 0 12 Yes, I talked with my friend about it and she said don' t worry. But I can' t help it. EOS 1 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand why are you are worried though, that is a lot honestly. EOS 1 0 14 I was doing so well in my classes too. Very close to graduating. EOS 1 1 15 [Question] Do you think that your grades will go down with the switch to online? EOS 1 0 16 Yes, I don' t do well with online learning. EOS 1 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have seen that be the case for many people. Hopefully your professors will be understanding with the switch. EOS 1 0 18 I hope so too.

3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hi. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] how are you? EOS 3 0 3 Not too good sadly:/ EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I' m sorry. what' s going on? EOS 3 0 5 My and my long term boyfriend just ended. Turns out he was cheating on me for the past 3 months with his best friend:( EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] whoa, that' s pretty messed up! how long were you together? EOS 3 0 7 Tell me about! We were planning on moving in together next year. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, I definitely wouldn' t go through with that then. Are you sure he was cheating? EOS 3 0 9 I noticed a few signs and confronted him about it. He didn’t even deny it! He wasn’t remorseful at all... it’s like he doesn’t even love me. How can you love someone yet betray the, somquiclu. So quickly** EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] did he admit to it? I would agree that he probably doesn' t feel the way you want him to. EOS 3 0 11 Not at all. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] but you know for certain? EOS 3 0 13 Yes HE ADMITTED IT. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] oh gotcha. yeah that is really messed up. how long were you two together? EOS 3 0 15 We were together for 3 years. I don’t know how he could just toss it down the drain. EOS 3 1 16 [Question] That' s horrible. Have you been able to talk to friends about it? EOS 3 0 17 No, that’s why I’m talking to u. I haven’t been able to eat or sleep in a few days. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Do you have any friends who you can talk to it about it? Some people around you who know you really well? EOS 3 0 19 No he was my everything. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You definitely need to eat and sleep even though you don' t feel like it. You have to take care of yourself even though it feels hard. Guys are a dime a dozen. I don' t know what that really means but I think it has something to do with being able to get guys easily. EOS 3 0 21 I know.. it’s hard when everything reminds me of him. EOS 3 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think if you really focus on what you need right now, you' ll be able to realize that you dodged a bullet. You don' t want to be with a cheater. you should want to be with someone who respects you and treats you well.

EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material... EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study! EOS 7 0 4 My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted. EOS 7 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version. EOS 7 0 6 Wow, that' s actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me. EOS 7 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot.
1 0 0 I am so mad that I can' t see straight. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello! What is on your mind today? Oh really? Why is that? EOS 1 0 2 Well, my boyfriend has cheated so many times that I cant count them. I then meet someone nice and cheat on him once and now he breaks up with me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] being mad that your boyfriend cheated is normal. being mad when dumped is normal. don' t you think you DESERVE better than he was treating you? EOS 1 0 4 Thank you! I can see that I am talking to someone who understands. I am wondering if I should beg him back?? I really do love him. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there too. Expecially with covid, it can be hard realiing you may be alone and it may be frusterating dating someone new. if you really love someone, shouldnt they love you back? did his actions show love? EOS 1 0 6 Yeah, and we have been together since high school so it is really hard to think of ever marrying anyone else. He asked me to marry him but we never made it official or got rings. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak. i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart. EOS 1 0 8 He told me he never wants kids with me but acts like he would have them someday, somehow? I think you' re right. EOS 1 1 9 [Self-disclosure] i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter. trust me, its not worth it in the long run. maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you! EOS 1 0 10 Noway! That is my worst nightmare, I am so sorry. That is a real eye opener for me/ That is exactly what I don' t think I could handle. I just am in the worst cycle ever and don' t have any friends to turn to or anybody who wants to listen to the drama. I think I have wasted a lot of my life and I can' t ever get the time back that I have invested in him. EOS 1 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i think a lot of couples are feeling stuck with covid. once things open up and everyone is vaccinated and get togethers happen again, i bet there will be a LOT more breakups and a lot more options out there! all we can do is learn from our mistakes and not let the past repeat itself. EOS 1 0 12 Yeah, I can see your point. It is nice being able to vent to you and feel like I am being heard. I never got that in my relationship with him. I need to learn from the past this time and stop repeating it. EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] with your newly aquired free time, you can focus on you! start a new hobby, dye your hair, do something you always wanted to do! EOS 1 0 14 I haven' t even had the time to get myself cute and fixed up in forever! I love that idea! I need to get my haircut. EOS 1 1 15 [Question] know what the best part is? EOS 1 0 16 No, I have idea? EOS 1 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] get yourself fixed up and cute, and find a hot new guy. your ex will see on social media and know he messed up and see you happy. its quite theraputic: D
2 0 0 how can i find a jobs in my area. What kind of jobs open right now. EOS 2 1 1 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried the classified ads?

0 1 0 [Question] hello how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hello I am taking a break from my studies to talk. I am fine thanks. Hope you are doing well also. I am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines. EOS 0 1 2 [Self-disclosure] i am fine thanks for asking. EOS 0 0 3 two exams and two assignments due at the end of this and next month. that' s good. EOS 0 1 4 [Others] Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful. EOS 0 0 5 yeah I have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it' s online and basically I do things on my own time.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you taking a lot of courses? EOS 0 0 7 2 courses. but I am pretty much using full time capacity on them. devoting full - time I mean. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] do you like doing school online better than in person? EOS 0 0 9 Have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good the more time you have to devote the better! EOS 0 0 11 I have done both methods. I definitely prefer in - school studies.. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel it is more stressful online? EOS 0 0 13 I am just disappointed that I have been slacking off and procrastinating. no it' s just that it' s a different avenue. I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. I think it' s because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow.. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after. EOS 0 0 15 yeah I take breaks in between.. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Yea this pandemic has me not as motivated to. EOS 0 0 17 But sometimes a lot more breaks or longer breaks than intended or I should. yeah definitely. Sorry to hear that.. It' s like everyday is the same and I can' t go out to refresh my mind or have a change of pace such as going to the gym or go out for a run. whereas before the pandemic, I can switch gears that way and come back refreshed. like going out to the movies and coming back with renewed enthusiasm. EOS 0 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Yea i have been missing the gym myself. Now i lookup youtube videos of workouts and do them, and it really helps to get me going in the day. Do you ever listen to music while you are trying to get work done? When i do that it tends to help time go faster and i get more done. EOS 0 0 19 I see. Yeah it' s good to have a routine and good way to resume life as usual.. sometimes I listen to music but I find it hard to read and absorb and listen to music. But I do listen to music sometimes when I am on assignments.. I also tend to drink coffee to focus my mind better. It does help. And I know I can pass the courses and on time but just that I am disappointed at my performance and work ethics as I know I have done much better before. So I am missing that sense of urgency, conscientiousness, and maturity., EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe find a nice meditation song to help relax you, i find when i am doing something finding a song with no words is better so i am able to concentrate. EOS 0 0 21 I see. That' s a good idea. I was also thinking I should have a regular workout routine at home again because I used to work out much more daily, even at home.. EOS 0 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are a very smart person and are able to acknowledge when you need to work harder on something. Don' t be to hard on yourself this pandemic is affecting everyone. EOS 0 0 23 working out does help me focus and be productive.. Thank you and I do agree with you on the pandemic. But this is a part of my mistake too but I think coming away from our conversation, I am more optimistic now having talked to someone about it.. EOS 0 1 24 [Self-disclosure] Yes i would imagine that would help to, i found that before i started working out at home i was beginning to feel lazy and not getting anything done, but that has all changed now. EOS 0 0 25 I see. Hopefully your routines are much better and more productive now. EOS 0 1 26 [Others] Aww well try not to be to hard on yourself. Set some daily goals and i bet you will be back to feeling normal in no time. I am glad talking has helped!

3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there how can be of help? EOS 3 0 2 I am suffering from low mood and general depression. I don' t know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down( obviously) and there doesn' t appear to be any real reason behind it. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue? EOS 3 0 4 I felt this way for a while actually isn' t a recent change it' s been building slowly over time. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same? EOS 3 0 6 I think I know what you mean. It' s getting worse. I feel very down. EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse. EOS 3 0 8 Yeah. I worry that I' ll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. I' m really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Firstly, you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with depression and it' s good that you have reached out for help for this. EOS 3 0 10 Any suggestions on what to do about it? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many reasons people have depression. It is a recognised medical condition and the good news is that there is help out there. The first step is recognising the problem. EOS 3 0 12 Ok well there is definitely a problem. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Have you spoken to friends and family about this? do they know how much you are struggling with it at the moment? EOS 3 0 14 not really I don' t want to bother other people with my problems. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. I think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help. EOS 3 0 16 Yeah maybe. I suppose nobody really understands but I could at least speak to them about it. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] everyone has problems and it is good to talk about them because a problem shared is a problem halved. It doesn' t mean the problems will go away but it might help you understand them and then be able to deal with them better. EOS 3 0 18 I don' t want to feel like this anymore. I' m willing to at least give it a go. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also think that it will be worse to get in touch with your doctor or a medical professional. these people are trained to deal with problems like yours and will be able to offer effective Solutions from a medical perspective.

I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I' m too scared to do anything about it as I don' t want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can' t help it. EOS 6 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through. EOS 6 0 4 Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I' m a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self - respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it. EOS 6 0 6 What happened out of interest when you had the conversation? EOS 6 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist. Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more. Since that time, he denies everything. EOS 6 0 8 I know. I' m a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It' s superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas' punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends.. EOS 6 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly, its not anyone else' s business. IF you' re suspicions are in fact correct, then you' ve got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart - breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she' s cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o= is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER! Curiously, why do you think she' s cheating? EOS 6 0 10 I' m almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two.. EOS 6 1 11 [Question] Hmm... So have you two live together? How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation? EOS 6 0 12 That' s just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven' t approached it with her because I' m scared see will just leave and I' ll be a laughing stock. I suppose I' m a joke either way! EOS 6 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There' s always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 I am well, thanks for asking. I am doing some studying and taking a break now. Just to talk about some of the feelings, thoughts, and stresses. The big thing on my mind now is the pandemic. And it' s the start of the second wave in my city.. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand what you are going though, indeed it is tough times. EOS 3 0 4 yeah it sure has been since March this year for my city. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So tell me, what are you going through your mind regarding the pandemic and the second wave? EOS 3 0 6 There' s kind of a lag as I am on the East Coast. So the cases didn' t really show up for the second wave until this month, only sporadically last month. But we were doing now until about two to three weeks ago. well fear, anxiety. worries, and also anger that people are being foolish and complacent, especially the youth groups that go to gyms and restaurants a lot, or to gatherings. even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, I don' t know and it just boggles on my mind.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I understand, I' m from the east coast and I' m deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown. EOS 3 0 8 I get that there' s a fatigue but I was there and I had that fatigue and I got over that a few months ago late summer when I tried to reason myself that it was safe to go out when there weren' t any cases then, as the first w ave was gone from my city. I see. Yeah I feel you definitely. like people are becoming impatient but this is not the right time to be. If I can overcome that initial impatience, others should also. If they have no right reason to be out except for work and personal business, then I don' t think they should be doing that too much.. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I think those who are aware of the situation should follow the rules and be aware. We really can' t change the situation because it human nature. EOS 3 0 10 it is. And that' s sad but true. It' s in our nature, as you say. It' s in our nature to destroy and to consume, etc. unfortunate but I can only cope by doing what I feel is right, and continue to do so. and not compromise my values along with others. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] However, we shouldn' t let it affect us physically, spiritually and most importantly mentally. We need stay relax and be aware of whats going on and believe that by following the rules we are doing our part in reducing the speard. EOS 3 0 12 yes I agree also. It' s hard though and it was getting to me even more middle of this year. I was more affected and more emotional. So I do see that I am getting used to it, though how long is uncertain, as the cases rise again. So hopefully I can stay well mentally. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Every night, I give myself an hour to unwind and relax. Things like, enjoying a movie, snack, drink or even favorite candle helps a lot.. EOS 3 0 14 and yeah, that' s the best we can do for now, as you say, is follow the rules and science, and do our part.. ignore the naysayers and compromisers. that' s really good. the relaxation technique, I mean. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Exactly, keep calm and relax. Avoid any negative vibes. Aim is to distress yourself. EOS 3 0 16 yeah I take time every now and then off from my studies, but my schedules are not set or consistent, and I procrastinate a lot. So that when I fall behind on a typical day, I try to catch up and end up not having enoug h time to even work out at home, or feel tired and sleepy, when I should have finished with my academic work early in the day. yeah that' s good advice. I will keep trying to tune out and filter the negativity and daily news. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m on the same boat. Build yourself a well structure schedule and aim to follow it. Trust me if accomplish 90% of it, that one hour me time will feel even better. EOS 3 0 18 so yeah, just aimless and procrastinate often, and need more self - imposed structure, discipline, maturity, organization, time - management, etc.. yeah good idea. like I am only lately gaining ground and staying on track so I am improving on this. yeah I should be like that too, something like having an hour to look forward to towards the end as a reward of some sort.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Any improvement is still improvement!
3 0 0 hi im sad. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Anything particular got you down? Hello. EOS 3 0 2 just life, bad year. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea bad year for everyone. The virus has really stopped us. Are you working or on layoff. EOS 3 0 4 yes it has, the political turmoil in the United States is very scary as well. I am self employed. but not working alot. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is an understatement with the politics. What do you do. EOS 3 0 6 I am a writer. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I Freelance my self. Do you work for anyone or just in general. EOS 3 0 8 mostly sights that talk about movies. there are a few i submit to. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Good. I write on a forum called Medium. I write and can get paid also. EOS 3 0 10 oh yes i know that one. EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There are various topics you can write about. Just write and post. Are you a copywriter. EOS 3 0 12 that is cool. a good way to discover other writers as well. I wish, that would be good money. i' m horrible at doing things for others, I need people to pay me to do my thing.. EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I read different postings and have over 30 followers. EOS 3 0 14 awesome, good for you. EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But if you write on Medium you can earn money. EOS 3 0 16 oh i didnt know that. thats cools. i should check it out. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] I ask that about copywriting because I am on LinkedIn. EOS 3 0 18 oh, i dont use it much. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There is also proofreading that can help establish yourself. EOS 3 0 20 on linkedin? really?. are you a machine? EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I use Medium and now I also have another account with them called Patreon.
4 0 0 hi, how are you? My friend, My best friend, has a new friend and hardly has time for me anymore, we have been friend for over ten years. this hurts. EOS 4 1 1 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before.
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one. EOS 4 0 16 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. What else can I do besides meditation? EOS 4 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds? EOS 4 0 18 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. Candles are much better for me. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil. EOS 4 0 20 I haven' t heard of that website before. I' ll have to check it out. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships.

EOS 6 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You have got such a nice girlfriend, have a happy life with her. EOS 6 0 14 but think about her mom how could i handle her. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Dont worry, just tell your girlfriend directly about the incident of how her mom is behaving towards you with a proof if you could. Or else be bold enough to warn her mom regarding this.
6 0 0 Hi. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. how are you? how may i help you today? EOS 6 0 2 Kinda sad today. Wanted to ask for some mental support. EOS 6 1 3 [Question] what is making you sad? EOS 6 0 4 Not being able to find a job after graduation. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand how you are feeling i had the same problem after i graduated. EOS 6 0 6 okay. EOS 6 1 7 [Question] have you put in job applications everywhere. EOS 6 0 8 Yes I did, and quite a lot but I think because of the pandemic they are not hiring that much. EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] With this pandemic going on i know it is even more harder to get a job. EOS 6 0 10 yes. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you are right. Have you looked on the internet such as indeed?

EOS 6 0 16 I' ve asked some friends, I think a friend will help me out when he' s not busy. EOS 6 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient. EOS 6 0 18 Yes I know. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried to go to place and talk to a hiring boss about a job? EOS 6 0 20 It' s hard with this virus to go anywhere pretty much. EOS 6 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] yes i can understand that.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hi. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] how are you? EOS 3 0 3 Not too good sadly:/ EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I' m sorry. what' s going on? EOS 3 0 5 My and my long term boyfriend just ended. Turns out he was cheating on me for the past 3 months with his best friend:( EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] whoa, that' s pretty messed up! how long were you together? EOS 3 0 7 Tell me about! We were planning on moving in together next year. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, I definitely wouldn' t go through with that then. Are you sure he was cheating? EOS 3 0 9 I noticed a few signs and confronted him about it. He didn’t even deny it! He wasn’t remorseful at all... it’s like he doesn’t even love me. How can you love someone yet betray the, somquiclu. So quickly** EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] did he admit to it? I would agree that he probably doesn' t feel the way you want him to. EOS 3 0 11 Not at all. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] but you know for certain? EOS 3 0 13 Yes HE ADMITTED IT. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] oh gotcha. yeah that is really messed up. how long were you two together?
4 1 0 [Question] Hello there, can I help you with any today?* anything. I am happy to talk to you about any problem that you might be having? EOS 4 0 1 I am having such a difficult time today!!! EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 4 1 2 [Greeting] I am good how are you. EOS 4 0 3 I am glad you are doing well, I have been struggling lately as my girlfriend that I was going to propose to broke up with me. She told me that my career path was different then hers and she just did not see it working out. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] How was your career path different? I understand how you are feeling everything will be okay. EOS 4 0 5 She had a desire to do marine biology and I wanted to pursue law enforcement as a police officer, however due to my back injury that fell through recently. She would spend most of her time doing field work, which would require her to spend time out at sea. She was working in a nursing home at the time and was not a marine biologist.. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] She did not like your career path? EOS 4 0 7 I am thinking that would be the case, however we dated for 3 years and then reconnecting about a year later which at this time was a distant relationship. She now has a boyfriend which she started date about 2 months she broke up with me. I found out that he works with her at the nursing home. I am unsure what to think, but she did say that she just didn' t see how our career paths would work out and that was that.. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right. It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after. EOS 4 0 9 I have had some friends echo that. I agree, it definitely felt like I was giving a lot through the time we dated. I have always wondered if this was a true statement, knowing her I think she probably got scared of what that entailed or just the distance. The new boyfriend was definitely a wild card, that I think has caused me to question her parting words. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don' t support your career. I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self. EOS 4 0 11 I appreciate your feedback on this,( this event for context occurred about a year ago and I have moved on from it) my support system has said the same thing. I think the difficult part is just overcoming that mental/ emotional hurdle of having the desire to marry her, which failed since it was an expectation of what was to come. I appreciate your suggestions. I think being the best" me" will help equip me for my future spouse!:). EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Right i can understand how you are feeling. We all have been in a situation where we have the desire to marry someone and all that fails. I have been in a situation like that. EOS 4 0 13 What did you do to help overcome the depression you faced or the grief of what was?. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I just had to let it go and just focus on myself because i had no choice. EOS 4 0 15 That is a valid point, I appreciate your help with this situation and listening to what I experienced.. EOS 4 1 16 [Greeting] No problem. Merry Christmas! EOS 4 0 17 Have a wonder Christmas, maybe we will chat again on this forum! Happy Turking:) EOS 4 1 18 [Greeting] Thank you:)
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello, I am looking for help in managing some depression. EOS 3 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You' ve come to a good place to start. Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 3 I am feeling resentful towards my husband for quitting his job, and my son for being the reason that he quit his job.. My son' s behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us. EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband' s loss of work and your son' s loss of his job is entirely understandable. EOS 3 0 5 I have a hard time not dwelling on the negative things going on. It' s hard to see anything positive or feel hopeful for the future. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and I understand the added stress that can cause in your household. That is a really difficult position to be in. EOS 3 0 7 My son is very defiant and argues with us about everything we try and get him to do, but he expects us to give him money for fun things that he wants to do when he isn' t willing to work or even help out around the house. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Regardless of what your husband' s actions are and your son' s, could you possibly make the time to do things to support yourself, that even momentarily would provide you with some positive feelings? EOS 3 0 9 I try to go for a run every night, that does help.. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard emotionally, so I am sorry you have to deal with your son' s behavior. EOS 3 0 11 It is hard to keep my emotions separate from what is going on with him. EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is very understandable! Setting boundaries for yourself may help. Even when it' s difficult, being clear with your son that you will not be giving him money could help. Sometimes being clear with your own expectations can help him to see what won' t be accepted from him as long as he is living in your home. EOS 3 0 13 Yes, I could do better at that. I want him to have fun and do things with friends, but I want him to be willing to work for what he wants, too.. I do struggle with expectations. I want him to be someone that he is not willing to be, I need to let go of that and just let him be himself and not base my emotions on his choices. EOS 3 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand that. Especially when it comes to people we are close to, it can be hard to separate our expectations from theirs. EOS 3 0 15 I feel guilty sometimes taking time to do things that I like and that are away from my family. I can see that I need to do that more, though. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I' ve had to learn this lesson many times with my own children. It' s difficult, but ultimately will give you some relief from your resentment. EOS 3 0 17 Thank you, it is helpful to know that other people have felt the same way. EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Absolutely! Being a parent is difficult. Remembering to support yourself helps. Making the time to do things to support your wellbeing doesn' t make you selfish at all.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 hi. Could you please help?. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How are you tonight?. EOS 3 0 3 I am okay. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 3 0 5 I caught my gf texting another guy. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So from what I understand, you caught your significant other texting someone else.. EOS 3 0 7 yes right. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] What types of things was she texting him about?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 I am well, thanks for asking. I am doing some studying and taking a break now. Just to talk about some of the feelings, thoughts, and stresses. The big thing on my mind now is the pandemic. And it' s the start of the second wave in my city.. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand what you are going though, indeed it is tough times. EOS 3 0 4 yeah it sure has been since March this year for my city. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So tell me, what are you going through your mind regarding the pandemic and the second wave? EOS 3 0 6 There' s kind of a lag as I am on the East Coast. So the cases didn' t really show up for the second wave until this month, only sporadically last month. But we were doing now until about two to three weeks ago. well fear, anxiety. worries, and also anger that people are being foolish and complacent, especially the youth groups that go to gyms and restaurants a lot, or to gatherings. even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, I don' t know and it just boggles on my mind.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I understand, I' m from the east coast and I' m deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together?
3 0 0 Hi. I am Mike. Live in central Kansas and have been very depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that, is there a particular reason or instance for you feeling this way? EOS 3 0 2 I lost my job due to Covid and they have shut down for good. no jobs around here and no vehicle so i feel hopeless and hate my living situation. just before covid hit i was saving to move... but then job closed. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes that is a very tough situation, Covid has real placed a large amount of stress through out the world. There may be a ray of hope however with a possible vaccine in the near future, maybe this will be back to normal soon and new jobs will become available. EOS 3 0 4 I hope so and that is what i know mentally. but emotionally it is hard. i just hate having no job, being at home, no money, no vehicle, and a very bad idea to date since there is a high contagious pandemic. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand and you are right it is a a lot of mental stress. Have you reached out to claim unemployment or go to a food pantry? During this pandemic you should not feel shameful to take advantage of these services, there are alot of people who have to ask for help for the first time in their lives. EOS 3 0 6 I did not make enough to get unemployment they said. I have not tried a food pantry but that is a great idea. what makes this difficult is I am in a very small town. like we dont wal marts or McDonalds or anything like that. Whole town closes at 9. the closest actual city is 45 miles away. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well please try the food pantry and see what they have to offer. Is there anyone whom you could ask for a ride in the future when they go to the bigger city? EOS 3 0 8 I will try food pantry. my sister goes to the city once a month, we shop for the month and i stay with my siter. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well its seem that you now have a plan try it out see how it works, hopefully this will get back to normal sooner than later and life may go back to somewhat normal and your stress level and mental exhaustion will also subside. Is there anything else you would like to talk about?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured.
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations.
4 0 0 i cant go back to uni due to finacial issue. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Good afternoon. How may I assist you? EOS 4 0 2 good afternnon. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] What is unit?

3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hi, how are you feeling today? EOS 3 0 2 I am not feeling the best. I have been having some depression, because of not being able to see friends and family during this pandemic. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Oh, boy, do I know that feeling! How are you dealing with it?( if I may ask)
4 0 0 Hi I am so sad my boyfriend was cheating and broke up with me when I found out. I don' t think I can ever be happy again. EOS 4 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self - esteem is that true? EOS 4 0 2 I have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. I have lost interest in everything I can barely make myself go to work. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better? EOS 4 0 4 Maybe, why would he cheat? I have seen her she is not that pretty. I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination. EOS 4 1 5 [Others] remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren' t right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else. EOS 4 0 6 I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn' t want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn' t mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that.
7 0 0 Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well. EOS 7 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well I can help you study if you' d like? EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material... EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study! EOS 7 0 4 My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted. EOS 7 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version.
0 1 0 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] hi. EOS 0 0 1 Online learning is not seems easy, Seems I am going to fail this year. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] chill my dear friend, nothing of that sort will happen. EOS 0 0 3 In - class learning was way better and I learned a lot but now its so confusing. EOS 0 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] everything you need is a little peace of mind, patience and little more effort. EOS 0 0 5 Even working with online tools is hard. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] i understand, but just think everyone else like us are doing the same and facing the same difficulties.
2 0 0 Hey. I am really scared about my job prospects. I am really fearful about my job situation. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] When did this fear start? EOS 2 0 2 It has been a while. I have had fears going back to my childhood traumas. I think that the work situation has only exacerbated that. The current economic climate has really made me fearful.... not sure if I am going to be able to keep my job. EOS 2 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct? EOS 2 0 4 Somewhat. But, my fears are relevant because I don' t know if I will always have a job. EOS 2 1 5 [Question] Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job? EOS 2 0 6 Do you know what I mean? What say u? I have some, but they have their own problems to deal with. Everyone has problems. Do you know what I mean? EOS 2 1 7 [Self-disclosure] You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me. EOS 2 0 8 It is making me have flashbacks of other traumatic situations, I think I need to find a good support chain, for sure. What say u? You take alooonnng time to respond. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many counselors who specialize in this field of job security and especially during this pandemic and the falling economy, they are great support systems. EOS 2 0 10 I am having a hard time.... Ok, I will look some of them online. I need some financial planners to help as well. Many Americans are hurting. EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic. EOS 2 0 12 Any other advices? What else can you advise me on? Should I look elsewhere for jobs? I will have to try that. Maybe it can help me ease my mind. EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Since a lot of this stress is being caused by your childhood trauma, it seems like there is something that connects that job to your trauma and if it cant be disconnected, it seems like you should find another job. And I understand that is not the easiest in these times but I believe you can do it! EOS 2 0 14 It is not easy right now. That' s for sure.. I am wondering if I could do Lyft or Uber. I think a side hustle could work, perhaps? EOS 2 1 15 [Question] Do you think those jobs would help you disconnect your childhood trauma and work life?
4 1 0 [Question] HI there, How are you doing today? EOS 4 0 1 Its hard for me to find a job. things could be doing better. it' s been a bad week for me.

EOS 4 0 5 thats good. i' m an engineer and i would like to take another engineering role. but they are hard to come by now adays. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea, would you consider doing something lesser for now just to make sure you have some income coming in? Or do you still collect unemployment at least? EOS 4 0 7 yes, i still get some unemployment which helps. i' ve done many interviews. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Thats good at least. Well, its great you are being proactive about it! I hate saying this but, just hang in there and keep moving on.

EOS 4 0 11 yes exactly, i have two young ones. its already hard for them to be at home all day and zoom for school. i just want to make this christmas specia. so its been a bummer with covid going on. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea i feel so bad for her. Thing is so presents arent everythign. Since you got little ones might be time for some new traditions.

4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out. EOS 4 0 6 I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night? EOS 4 0 8 I can' t sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it' s typically late afternoon. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds like you are doing the very best you can under difficult circumstances. you should feel very proud about that. EOS 4 0 10 thank you. i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] it sounds to me that your sleep issue is really weighing on your mind. you may be setting yourself up for sleep issues by thinking about this so much. is that possible? EOS 4 0 12 yes it may be. i' m not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you' re under a lot of pressure. it' s only natural that you would feel overwhelmed. dont be hard on yourself. you' re doing the best you can. EOS 4 0 14 thank you. that is very supportive. i just dont know how to make the next ten days go by faster. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can spend some time doing pleasant things. it is true that time seems to go fast when we' re having fun.

EOS 4 0 18 maybe overwatch. i haven' t been playing them much. EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] i' m wondering: are you a reader? do you enjoy reading? i' m asking because i find when i read a good book, time seems to move very quickly. EOS 4 0 20 i am. but i have a hard time focusing as of late. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can make a goal of reading a few pages and then see if you can build on that. then, if you want, you can make a goal of reading a chapter. EOS 4 0 22 that' s a great idea. that may help a lot with focus. EOS 4 1 23 [Self-disclosure] personally i love reading; especially non fiction. what type of books do you enjoy? EOS 4 0 24 dystopian fantasy style books. and also historical nonfiction. EOS 4 1 25 [Self-disclosure] i enjoy historical non fiction very much. do you have any favorite authors?
3 0 0 hi im sad. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Anything particular got you down? Hello. EOS 3 0 2 just life, bad year. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea bad year for everyone. The virus has really stopped us. Are you working or on layoff. EOS 3 0 4 yes it has, the political turmoil in the United States is very scary as well. I am self employed. but not working alot. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is an understatement with the politics. What do you do. EOS 3 0 6 I am a writer. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I Freelance my self. Do you work for anyone or just in general. EOS 3 0 8 mostly sights that talk about movies. there are a few i submit to. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Good. I write on a forum called Medium. I write and can get paid also. EOS 3 0 10 oh yes i know that one. EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There are various topics you can write about. Just write and post. Are you a copywriter. EOS 3 0 12 that is cool. a good way to discover other writers as well. I wish, that would be good money. i' m horrible at doing things for others, I need people to pay me to do my thing.. EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I read different postings and have over 30 followers. EOS 3 0 14 awesome, good for you. EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But if you write on Medium you can earn money. EOS 3 0 16 oh i didnt know that. thats cools. i should check it out. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] I ask that about copywriting because I am on LinkedIn. EOS 3 0 18 oh, i dont use it much.

4 0 0 hi, how are you? My friend, My best friend, has a new friend and hardly has time for me anymore, we have been friend for over ten years. this hurts. EOS 4 1 1 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before. EOS 4 0 2 its so annoying and hurtful. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Yeah i can tell you something you might not want to hear but it ended with us ending our friendship on that level. EOS 4 0 4 i definitely do not want to end our friendship, that would be even more painful. EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years. We still hang out but it isnt like it was before. People move on to others and it hurts. They usually are not trying to hurt us though. EOS 4 0 6 I know, but its hard when you are the one still stuck, Im not ready for change. EOS 4 1 7 [Others] Yea it was hard for me too. Thats the thing about change it just happens. I would do something focusing on yourself. Trying to make yourself feel better. EOS 4 0 8 i could try to focus on myself. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everyone needs to and everyone forgets too heh.
2 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are we doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Okay how are you? EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Im doing great thanks. Anything on your mind today? EOS 2 0 3 Just pondering microcheating and wondering why someone who I do not like that way would be considered microcheating. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] And what do you mean by microcheating? EOS 2 0 5 It is a new thing like having a man you like that you check up on on social media even though you are in a relationship, or eating lunch with the same woman or man that you like but you don' t act on because you are married. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh i see, well i think overthinking things like that can lead to unwanted emotions. Or putting yourself in a situation with another person when you are in a relationship might mean there are other issues going on. EOS 2 0 7 Yes i see that. No nothing else going on just thinking that the definition maybe shouldn' t be as exact for the type of person that I do not talk to because of his reservations about it. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, if you are not talking to them then i see no harm. If you are talking to them with some sort of intention to for a relationship beyond friendship then i see issues arising. EOS 2 0 9 That is what I feel. I am not talking to him. I had to the other day to get in contact with someone( medical emergency) but do not call just to chat and catch up. I even unfriended him. I just want to comfort him over it but I think it is best just to never speak of him again. Comfort my fiance. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] To never speak to your fiance? If you want to continue your relationship and you do not feel you can continue a platonic relationship with this other person then that might be best. EOS 2 0 11 No I am ending my friendship with him. That is what is best. EOS 2 1 12 [Question] I think it might be as well if you cannot control it. I do have to ask though, are you happy with your Fiance? EOS 2 0 13 Yes very. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Then i 100% back you on your decision. Id take this time to focus on you too. Strengthen the bond a bit. EOS 2 0 15 Yes, I think that would be best. I thank you for your time. EOS 2 1 16 [Greeting] I thank you for opening up!
1 0 0 I' m qualified for a promotion but my boss is refusing to promote me based on biased feedback he has received from someone else. EOS 1 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn' t willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right? EOS 1 0 2 Yes that' s right. It' s frustratgn.* frustrating. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co - worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective. EOS 1 0 4 Unfortunately I can' t really talk to anyone at work because there is no one I trust to this extent. Promotions are a bit of a sensitive issue. EOS 1 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you reported to your HR department the issue around biased feedback being used as a determining factor in not being considered? EOS 1 0 6 The HR department favours managers so I am worried that will damage my chances of promotion further. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry you have to deal with this at work. I think you deserve the promotion because you are very dedicated. EOS 1 0 8 Thanks, that' s good to hear. EOS 1 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think if you continue to advocate for yourself in a positive manner you could possibly increase the chances of being considered for the promotion. EOS 1 0 10 It' s hard to be positive when I feel like my manager is not receptive to my opinions and just trusts the feedback given by this one other person. EOS 1 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' ve worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment. My co - workers were not supportive and I was always overlooked. Eventually, I realized that the environment was toxic and chose to start applying for different jobs. I felt like if my potential couldn' t be appreciated then I should go somewhere with opportunities for growth.

For sure if I lose my job now I might go to depression because I have a family to take care of. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, don' t worry friend, EOS 4 0 5 Are there any ways you know that could help me convince my boss that that it is not the right time to cut down on manpower?

EOS 4 0 7 Incase i lose the job, are there ways that can help me stay out of stress of losing the job? I am worried that losing a job may cause me a lot of harm since my bills depend on my current job. EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] definitely, you have to try to get the other work. don' t give up your confident, belive your self. EOS 4 0 9 I am really worried that getting another job during this season of corona is not easy, that is the stress that is almost killing me. Sure I do believe myself.

3 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you. EOS 3 0 1 Not doing well. I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Oh no, how long had you been together? EOS 3 0 3 we were together for 2 years. It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Wow, that' s horrible. How do you feel about it? EOS 3 0 5 I feel lost. I' m so used to her being around everyday. Now I don' t know what to do with myself without her. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year. EOS 3 0 7 Not only that, but with Covid going on I have noone i can see to talk about it. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have any family? EOS 3 0 9 Yes, i do, but they are far away. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Friends closeby? Hobbies? What kind of work do you do?

0 0 0 Hello, I' m having a terrible day. My name is Sean and I work for a large distribution company. EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] hi! i' m sorry to hear that. how is your work going so far. EOS 0 0 2 The problem with a job like Amazon or Kehe distribution is the quotas. The pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID? EOS 0 0 4 no COVID 19 has nothing to do with any of this work. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how anxious you are right now. Can you give me some more info on your job. EOS 0 0 6 well when there are 50 million americans out of work right it' s a bit scary. i' m a forklift operator..... I move pallets from one area of the warehouse to another but i. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i totally understand how nerve wrecking this is, but trust me you guys being front - line workers are our real heros. EOS 0 0 8 am based on a quota. I am suppose to be able to move 10 pallets per hour. that' s almost impossible as it is a 1 million square foot warehouse. If i get a pallet on the west side and have to move it to the east side that takes 7 - 10 minutes even if your going dangerously fast. doesn' t feel like it to me. EOS 0 1 9 [Question] did you try discussing your concerns with your Team Lead/ Warehouse Supervisor of your group. EOS 0 0 10 I feel like a replaceable cog in a giant machine that doesn' t give two shits whether I show up for work or not despite having over five years experience with over 12 forklifts..... Yes and they always say the same thing. You need to get your numbers up but it' s a catch 22 you can' t possibly safely get your numbers up and accomplish your quotas. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are doing your best and are working really hard. EOS 0 0 12 so. EOS 0 1 13 [Question] just a thought - did you try changing roles within the warehouse to a different position? or try checking with the manager regarding this. you have 5 years exp, i' m sure you deserve a better role and pay. EOS 0 0 14 I am a felon and I have a bachelores degree in business management. I am desperately trying to get out of the quota based work areas. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] i understand, but when i had a slight trouble with my job, talking to my manager helped me a lot. also, your manager is your best point of contact for a great reference.
1 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 1 0 1 I am just a little angry. My mother and I had another blow - up. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother? EOS 1 0 3 It is why I am angry. This occurs at least every other day. I say something harmless and she thinks I am saying it in a way that is rude or something. EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you can figure out a way to communicate better. EOS 1 0 5 I do not know for sure where to start. If I try to tell her that is not what I mean it is like she doesn' t understand? EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to feel misunderstood. EOS 1 0 7 For example today I was just saying I like the food she had cooked us for supper. She took that to mean I never liked the food she made before. She says I do not appreciate her and I should be grateful to have her. EOS 1 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing your best to be nice but it isn' t getting through. EOS 1 0 9 Maybe it was the way she was brought up that she is so sensitive. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everybody has stuff from their past that affects them. EOS 1 0 11 But they should not take how they feel on others right? But I know I have to be understanding. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You should be understanding, especially since you already know this. EOS 1 0 13 Can you relate to this situation? EOS 1 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have had personal disputes with my parents in the past. Most of the time there' s other things going on that makes a person act different. EOS 1 0 15 Maybe I could just take deep breath and kind of step back a minute before I respond. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It would be good to do that. Maybe try to have a conversation and tell her you support her no matter what she' s going through. EOS 1 0 17 I guess the best time to do that was when she is in a very good mood. EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do some chores or something that helps her out and just let her know you want to have a serious talk some time. EOS 1 0 19 But what if she thinks me helping her out is criticizing the way she does things? That seems like the way she would be. EOS 1 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try giving reassurance that you want to show you care. EOS 1 0 21 I will try this. It is worth a shot. We can' t go through life being upset at each other. EOS 1 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] I feel the same way. I hope you can get things on better terms.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all. EOS 0 0 45 Also being far away from him sucks. EOS 0 1 46 [Question] Are you guys FaceTiming or communicating at all other than by texts? EOS 0 0 47 You are being very helpful by the way thank you. We aren' t FaceTiming. I just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it.. EOS 0 1 48 [Greeting] I' m trying my best, thank you for the input! Upset about leaving the apartment? Or was there something else that happened that weekend? EOS 0 0 49 Just leaving him. EOS 0 1 50 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you guys thought about scheduling date nights through FaceTime? EOS 0 0 51 I think he would but he hasn' t been feeling really good about his appearance lately. I asked and that' s what he told me. EOS 0 1 52 [Self-disclosure] I understand that completely, I can relate a lot.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Nice to meet you Jim, I am doing well. Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 3 I really appreciate your time Yes. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What is on your mind? EOS 0 0 5 I have been retired for over 2 years and would like to return to the workforce, part - ti me. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are thinking of going back to work? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, It would help us greatly. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have the right idea already. EOS 0 0 9 There are plenty of jobs and not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will find something suitable if you keep trying. EOS 0 0 11 Thanks What do you mean? Yeah, I know this but I don' t feel it.. EOS 0 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] You may feel a little apprehensive to get started. EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, I am. I know I can do it. Not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have been in the same position before and came out successful in the end. EOS 0 0 15 Wow, That' s great. How did you start?. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I just decided. EOS 0 0 17 What gave you the strength to go forward? I have this nervousness about getting rejected.. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing little things every day. EOS 0 0 19 So, keep myself busy and try to ignore my nervousness? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Really adds up and helps to get the big picture moving. EOS 0 0 21 OK, so with, well, kinf0f like baby steps.... right. EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It is about making small adjustments to feed a good habit. EOS 0 0 23 Build up my confidence and not take things personally. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Building it in to your daily life will make you feel accomplished. EOS 0 0 25 Yeah, so true. EOS 0 1 26 [Self-disclosure] THis really helped me to get going in the past. EOS 0 0 27 I have a few ideas and go with my strength' s and abilities that I have already been successful in the past. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You will find those things that you know you want. EOS 0 0 29 Yeah, I like it. I guess I needed to just chat with someone and listen to myself. EOS 0 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] Always beleive in yourself! EOS 0 0 31 True, that is what my wonderful Wife tells me and that God has a plan for me. Thanks. EOS 0 1 32 [Greeting] You are welcome and everybody is rooting for you. EOS 0 0 33 That' s really true, Need to stop feeling sorry for myself. Thank you. This has been helpful. EOS 0 1 34 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Start doing things and they will grow friend. EOS 0 0 35 Yes, they will. Thank you.. This is good. Take care and God bless. TY. EOS 0 1 36 [Greeting] You are welcome and best of wishes. Take care, bless yall. EOS 0 0 37 You, too. EOS 0 1 38 [Others] You can end the chat safely now.
0 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hai. EOS 0 0 1 Hey. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How are you friend? Where are you from? EOS 0 0 3 Okay i guess. North Carolina. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] ok, EOS 0 0 5 What about you? EOS 0 1 6 [Question] What are you doing? i am john from, new york.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Much better than normal, even though the stock market is down. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Are you an investor? EOS 0 0 3 I am a student that tries to put as much money into as possible. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand the struggle with being at that stage in life. Has this affected you negatively? EOS 0 0 5 No the stock market really doesn' t cause stress for me, mostly just small things that I think my brain overreacts to. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] What sorts of things? EOS 0 0 7 Kind of a variety of things. I typically get bad anxiety after a night of going out. So I am trying to cut out drinking. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety? Do you suffer from anxiety when you do not drink ever? EOS 0 0 9 Sometimes but I think the root from them comes from when I do something while I' m drinking. Not that I do anything bad, but I just don' t like not remembering things. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] So you would say that you drink to the point of blacking out? Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you' ve had a reasonable amount of alcohol? EOS 0 0 11 I used to black out a lot, but I have tried to control it by cutting the former amount of drinks I consumed in half, if I do choose to go out. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I have drank to the point of blacking out several times in my life mostly when I was younger and I found that it either came from a certain type of alcohol or mixing different types. Have you noticed it could be related to that or simply the amount of alcohol you are drinking?. EOS 0 0 13 It is typically the amount I' m drinking, but cutting out drinking as a whole has probably helped me the most. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Certainly making sure that you only drink a certain amount like a couple drinks of beer or only a shot of harder drinks might alleviate this or refraining from mixing drinks. Sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep... the amount you drink. Do your friends encourage you to drink more? EOS 0 0 15 They don' t necessarily attempt to get me to drink more in volume, but I do have to tell them I' m not gonna go out for the night. EOS 0 1 16 [Question] Are they okay with it when you decline? EOS 0 0 17 Yes after one or two statements they give up.. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay so they ask you a couple of times and then they move on. That' s good that they don' t push you too much. Certainly keep with it if not drinking helps you to not make bad decisions. I' m sure you have other interests in life that maybe you could drag your friends out to enjoy so that might help... sober fun! Also if you find that you' re struggling with not drinking that might be a time to look for support. Maybe see a therapist as there may be psychological reasons you can not refrain from drinking. Maybe look into a group like AA or something similar to share your struggles with others.
2 0 0 Hello. Maybe you can help me calm down. I just found out that I' m losing my job in January.( 1) EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hello! I hope I can. I am so sorry to hear that. That' s so rough. There are so many people going through this right now. EOS 2 0 2 Yes and that worries me even more. More people competing for the same jobs.( 2) EOS 2 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a fare worry but you can' t be discourged. YOu need to think positively. You can use this as a time to reconnect with family and to get your resume together. EOS 2 0 4 I will have to do a new resume definitely. It' s been awhile.( 3) EOS 2 1 5 [Question] That' s a good activity!! Do you have anyone who can help you with it? EOS 2 0 6 I' ll have to think on that, I have a friend that might be able to help but it' s been awhile for both of us( 4) EOS 2 1 7 [Question] Do you have any hobbies you can work on while you' re home? EOS 2 0 8 Well I don' t think they are hobbies, but there are things that need to be done around the house. Guess I can keep myself busy at least( 5) EOS 2 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s really helpfuL! staying busy is good. It' s also really good time to reconnect with a loved ones and friends. You can try virtual connections. EOS 2 0 10 Yes, but I know I' ll also have a lot of work to do to get ready to find a new job. I' m really hoping I can find one before I lose this one( 6) EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] HAve you been searching online sites? They post so many nowadays! If you spend a few hours a day. i' m sure that you' ll find one in no time!!
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 1 0 1 I could be better. How about U? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] I am doing well. Whats bothering you? EOS 1 0 3 A friend screwed me out of money and a business venture. I am no longer friends with her. We were really close before this.. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! I am so sorry that has happened to you. That must feel like such a betrayal. Can you tell me more about it? EOS 1 0 5 It does. I' ve known her for 14 years and we dated. I invested a lot of money in a business she wanted to do. She took the money and ran. EOS 1 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hi. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] how are you? EOS 3 0 3 Not too good sadly:/ EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I' m sorry. what' s going on? EOS 3 0 5 My and my long term boyfriend just ended. Turns out he was cheating on me for the past 3 months with his best friend:( EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] whoa, that' s pretty messed up! how long were you together? EOS 3 0 7 Tell me about! We were planning on moving in together next year. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, I definitely wouldn' t go through with that then. Are you sure he was cheating? EOS 3 0 9 I noticed a few signs and confronted him about it. He didn’t even deny it! He wasn’t remorseful at all... it’s like he doesn’t even love me. How can you love someone yet betray the, somquiclu. So quickly** EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] did he admit to it? I would agree that he probably doesn' t feel the way you want him to. EOS 3 0 11 Not at all. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] but you know for certain? EOS 3 0 13 Yes HE ADMITTED IT. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] oh gotcha. yeah that is really messed up. how long were you two together? EOS 3 0 15 We were together for 3 years. I don’t know how he could just toss it down the drain. EOS 3 1 16 [Question] That' s horrible. Have you been able to talk to friends about it? EOS 3 0 17 No, that’s why I’m talking to u. I haven’t been able to eat or sleep in a few days. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Do you have any friends who you can talk to it about it? Some people around you who know you really well? EOS 3 0 19 No he was my everything. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You definitely need to eat and sleep even though you don' t feel like it. You have to take care of yourself even though it feels hard. Guys are a dime a dozen. I don' t know what that really means but I think it has something to do with being able to get guys easily. EOS 3 0 21 I know.. it’s hard when everything reminds me of him. EOS 3 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think if you really focus on what you need right now, you' ll be able to realize that you dodged a bullet. You don' t want to be with a cheater. you should want to be with someone who respects you and treats you well. EOS 3 0 23 Are righ... it just sucks i have to start all over again. EOS 3 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think if you make some time for yourself and talk to your friends you' ll feel a bit better even though it sucks. I hear you, I' ve had to start over again lots of times. but the right guy is out there. Just imagine how bad it would have been if you found out after you moved in with him. You dodged a bullet! are you still there? Hello?
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with this evening?. EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very depressed lately. Like a constant pressure that i don' t know exactly what it is. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I' m very sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 4 0 3 I think the days getting shorter makes it worse. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating. EOS 4 0 5 Do you have any tips on how to overcome it? EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help. I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through Instagram. I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while.. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up. I like to stay up, but when it' s time to get up i dread it. Bad cycle. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sure, that' s understandable. There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin D, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them.. EOS 4 0 9 Time is the fire in which we burn. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] Now that is intractable. EOS 4 0 11 Lol... yes it is. The pandemic heightens all our awareness of time and mortality. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes, to me, the enormity of the universe is calming to my anxiety. Being assured that I mean absolutely nothing is nice sometimes. EOS 4 0 13 And drives the civil unrest which makes me feel anxious and insecure. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] Not in a scary, better - off - dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion. I' m a flea to the universe. EOS 4 0 15 Yes i find that a strangly comforting thought. EOS 4 1 16 [Others] ... then you have to wonder, what are fleas thinking?!. EOS 4 0 17 They have the luxury of instinct without having to" think" at all. EOS 4 1 18 [Others] God, tell me more, lol. EOS 4 0 19 They just be fleas. Fleas gonna flea. EOS 4 1 20 [Others] Galaxies gonna spiral. EOS 4 0 21 I worry too that the U. S. government has no idea what it' s doing. And the people at large are all losing their mental health. EOS 4 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah they have kicked the can down to local governments, local governments kick the can down to the citizens. It' s absurd. No on wants to take responsibility for taking responsibility.. It' s a very uncertain situation and it' s a psychological reality that when we don' t have physical or metnal security, it' s extremely hard for a human being to progress through stages in life or learn new skill as well or at all. EOS 4 0 23 I guess it' s like you said before, we can only change ourselves. EOS 4 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] So everyone' s plans are canceled for the year, plus no one has any idea when the shit' s going to end, so not unlike a dog at the vet, the suffering seems interminable..
1 0 0 I' m qualified for a promotion but my boss is refusing to promote me based on biased feedback he has received from someone else. EOS 1 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn' t willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right? EOS 1 0 2 Yes that' s right. It' s frustratgn.* frustrating. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co - worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective. EOS 1 0 4 Unfortunately I can' t really talk to anyone at work because there is no one I trust to this extent. Promotions are a bit of a sensitive issue. EOS 1 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you reported to your HR department the issue around biased feedback being used as a determining factor in not being considered? EOS 1 0 6 The HR department favours managers so I am worried that will damage my chances of promotion further. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry you have to deal with this at work. I think you deserve the promotion because you are very dedicated. EOS 1 0 8 Thanks, that' s good to hear. EOS 1 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think if you continue to advocate for yourself in a positive manner you could possibly increase the chances of being considered for the promotion.
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. EOS 6 0 1 hello. how are you? I wanted to briefly chat about my jealous feeling. My friend sent me a pic as a greeting showing her hubby and I am jealous. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] I am doing good. How are you? EOS 6 0 3 Next time I see her I want to hide my jealous feeling, but not sure if I can do it well. great. I am good. EOS 6 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so, you envy your friend having a good spouse, is that correct? EOS 6 0 5 yes that is correct. EOS 6 1 6 [Question] Are you a female, if I may ask? EOS 6 0 7 yes. EOS 6 1 8 [Question] Do you have a husband or bf?
0 0 0 Hello, I' m having a terrible day. My name is Sean and I work for a large distribution company. EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] hi! i' m sorry to hear that. how is your work going so far. EOS 0 0 2 The problem with a job like Amazon or Kehe distribution is the quotas. The pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID? EOS 0 0 4 no COVID 19 has nothing to do with any of this work. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how anxious you are right now. Can you give me some more info on your job. EOS 0 0 6 well when there are 50 million americans out of work right it' s a bit scary. i' m a forklift operator..... I move pallets from one area of the warehouse to another but i. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i totally understand how nerve wrecking this is, but trust me you guys being front - line workers are our real heros. EOS 0 0 8 am based on a quota. I am suppose to be able to move 10 pallets per hour. that' s almost impossible as it is a 1 million square foot warehouse. If i get a pallet on the west side and have to move it to the east side that takes 7 - 10 minutes even if your going dangerously fast. doesn' t feel like it to me. EOS 0 1 9 [Question] did you try discussing your concerns with your Team Lead/ Warehouse Supervisor of your group. EOS 0 0 10 I feel like a replaceable cog in a giant machine that doesn' t give two shits whether I show up for work or not despite having over five years experience with over 12 forklifts..... Yes and they always say the same thing. You need to get your numbers up but it' s a catch 22 you can' t possibly safely get your numbers up and accomplish your quotas. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are doing your best and are working really hard. EOS 0 0 12 so. EOS 0 1 13 [Question] just a thought - did you try changing roles within the warehouse to a different position? or try checking with the manager regarding this. you have 5 years exp, i' m sure you deserve a better role and pay. EOS 0 0 14 I am a felon and I have a bachelores degree in business management. I am desperately trying to get out of the quota based work areas. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] i understand, but when i had a slight trouble with my job, talking to my manager helped me a lot. also, your manager is your best point of contact for a great reference. EOS 0 0 16 Do you know how incredibly hard it is to serve your time in jail for 3 years and get out and can' t find a job except scrubbing floors or cleaning shit or servinge tables. my manager doesn' t give a shit. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] thats hard,.. but you can do it. EOS 0 0 18 do what. work at burger king for$ 7. 25 an hour. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] do your best in your job! hard work ultimately pays off! EOS 0 0 20 I' m not so sure if that' s true anymore. It' s not what you know.... it' s who you know. and with my felony my reputation is nothing but shit. my real worry is that this is one of the highest paying jobs in my area.$ 16 an hour plus almost unlimiteed overtime. for a felon even with a degree that' s phenominal in florida. EOS 0 1 21 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you feel you are not heard and thats why you are pushing yourself hard do you feel that way.
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Same old.. still trying to lose weight. Already on day 20 for fasting. did not lose a single pound. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight. What kind of methods have you been using? EOS 0 0 4 I tried keto diet for 6 months, didn' t work. So now on Fasting. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are really discouraged. EOS 0 0 6 I also go to gym 2 times a week. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow! You have been trying practically everything. You are really motivated. EOS 0 0 8 Yea, very discouraged... EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Losing weight can be difficult. I' ve struggled with that many times. Have you thought of consulting a dietician or a nutritionist to help? Maybe, they would offer some new suggestions. EOS 0 0 10 I am already lucky that I can sometime able to book swimming pool close by. I considered but they said I am not overweight. EOS 0 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like they didn' t listen to your needs. And it seems like you are doing a great job exercising at the pool and employing other methods to lose weight. What is your primary motivation behind your weight loss goal? EOS 0 0 12 The added weight is putting pressure on my hips and knees.. Causing a lot of pain as well for my lower back. EOS 0 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] That' s no good. I' ll bet that is difficult to deal with. Have you thought about teaming up with a friend and going on daily walks?
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, my name is Rose, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi Rose. I' m ok, but I get embarrassed about my curly hair. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What about your hair is embarrasing exactly? Curls seem like a lovely thing to have( mine is dead straight, lets trade lol) But no, seriously, what in particular don' t you like about it? i admire people who have natural curls. EOS 4 0 3 They are unruly and not the pretty kind of curls. Often get frizzy by the end of the day. It get' s frustrating when I always look a mess. EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I could see that being frustrating, if you can' t keep them neat. is your hair short or long? EOS 4 0 5 It is long. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you thought of having it shorter, it might be easier to tame? Just a thought.... you say you always look like a mess... is that your personal opinion or has anyone else commented on your hair? EOS 4 0 7 I started to cut it shorter last time, but my stylist said it would be big. It is hard to find the right product.. It is my personal opinion.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you asked a friend for an honest opinion? EOS 4 0 9 My friend likes my hair, but also says she can see that it is hard to manage. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance.. EOS 4 0 11 I can totally relate to that. I think we always want what we dont have. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One thing I have started doing, since my hair hasn' t been cut for a year due to pandemic, is wearing hats. my hair is driving me crazy, so I get your frustration. Is it long enough to braid? EOS 4 0 13 I went a year without cutting mine as well for the same reason. That is probably why it felt so out of control now that you say that. Now that I am vaccinated I just got it cut. Maybe I will like it better now. Yes, I do like braids. That is a good idea. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] yay! a haircut!!! Congrats. EOS 4 0 15 Thank you. It does make it feel a little better. I hope you can get yours cut soon too. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] one last suggestion: ask more stylists' opinions perhaps? oh thankyou.... had my shot yesterday.... now I have to wait for our lockdown to expire( May 20) so I have a bit more shag to go.

0 0 0 Hello, I' m having a terrible day. My name is Sean and I work for a large distribution company. EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] hi! i' m sorry to hear that. how is your work going so far. EOS 0 0 2 The problem with a job like Amazon or Kehe distribution is the quotas. The pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID?
3 0 0 hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 i am ok so far. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What brings you here today?
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it.

EOS 4 0 4 Lately, my friends started to make jokes about my face being ugly. They even called my face as flat as a pan! What should I do? I see them everyday on the bus. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried confronting them and asking why they are being bullies? EOS 4 0 6 I did and they respond by saying that they are just joking and that I' m handsome. But it' s starting to get on my nerves because it' s all they make fun about every time they see me! EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you are very handsome! They could just be jealous.

EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing. EOS 6 0 8 Yeah, people don' t know that just because my two friends go" Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two( so - called) friends? EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] definatly not... have you tried explaining your situation to them?

EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] a lot of times donating time to help organisatiosn is more valuable then money. EOS 6 0 16 Great point. EOS 6 1 17 [Others] times and situations change so thats ok. EOS 6 0 18 My friends may like to know that I am trading time.... instead of donating money. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i worked for a non profit and the biggest struggle was to find volunteers to help out. EOS 6 0 20 Yes, you make a good point. EOS 6 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I feel that is a great donation and if they do not like that tell them money is easy to give time not. EOS 6 0 22 The proble is that some people just want to shame people without knowing their plight. EOS 6 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, true, we need to stay above them then in all actuality we don' t know what goes on behind closed doors in their life. sometimes people like that reflect. EOS 6 0 24 I need to think of others ways to contribute that won' t have my friends hating on me. I have pride, too. EOS 6 1 25 [Others] BUt it should be what you want not what your' freinds want. you should be proud of yourself. EOS 6 0 26 Yeah...... EOS 6 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hopefully next year will bring better things and maybe even a better friend that does not judge into your life.

EOS 4 1 9 [Question] ah, are they elderly or have a weakened immune system? EOS 4 0 10 elderly. dads doctor told me not to meet friends in person cuz i could pass it onto him. EOS 4 1 11 [Others] gotcha. you must live with them to help them out! EOS 4 0 12 i sure do. thing is people my age are getting very sick with it too. and some elderly are not. so i could be helping myself more than my dad. EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] mine are in another state so i don' t have to worry about my behavior. you are right though, anyone can get it... i should probably be more careful myself. EOS 4 0 14 yes absolutely. never know. its a weird virus. best to keep immune system high which i have been. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] i have increased my vitamins i admit. have you as well? EOS 4 0 16 yes and started taking airborne for vitamin c. EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s great! EOS 4 0 18 Thank ya. I worry about my other relatives out of state.

6 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. EOS 6 0 1 hello. how are you? I wanted to briefly chat about my jealous feeling. My friend sent me a pic as a greeting showing her hubby and I am jealous. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] I am doing good. How are you?
3 0 0 Hi, How are you doing? I am in bad mood.. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] What' s wrong? EOS 3 0 2 This work from home tension and cant go out with my family and parties. It makes me depressed and cant bear this pathedic situation. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. I, too, am struggling with COVID - 19. It' s going to be difficult not to see family during the holidays. We' ll get through this, though, don' t you think. Have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone? Maybe there is a way to find ways to have fun online with your friends and family. We actually played games together recently. Is that something you could do to reconnect? EOS 3 0 4 I am fully occupied with my job. This software field sucks me. Even weekends also they are expecting to work with offshore people. I dont find the time to spend with my partner and kids. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there any way you could talk to your supervisor about achieving a better work life balance? EOS 3 0 6 Yeah! Good Idea, I ll make a call with my Manager once. It could be better to have vacation for a week. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that could make a big difference in changing things for you. You just need a better work/ life balance to straighten things out. I had a similar experience in the past, and talking with my manager about time off reinvigorated me.
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing? EOS 6 0 1 I' m doing okay.. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you want to talk about? EOS 6 0 3 I' m having problems with getting up everyday and doing my daily routine. I feel bad because these are things that other people do normally. EOS 6 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah, I' ve definitely felt that way... especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day? EOS 6 0 5 Exactly. Jogging, eating breakfast, getting dressed. EOS 6 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yep, for me it' s kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just" take a break" from grinding. MTurk has kind of helped me get back in a working mindset and given me more energy... have you been doing a lot of MTurk lately? EOS 6 0 7 Yeah, 2020 has been a crazy year. I' ve been doing Mturk here and there. I plan on doing it more. It helps me stay productive. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah it helps, just forcing yourself to have goals, for sure. I' ve been determined to hit a number on MTurk and exercise every time I' m feeling tired, instead of taking a nap because my boss can' t see me, lol. I would definitely say just start setting goals and try to look forward to 2021 being better. EOS 6 0 9 Okay, I hear you. Thanks. Yeah, I guess I have to really force myself. EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Force yourself at first, then the" body in motion, stays in motion" law will take over.:) All I know, is that nothing is worse than ending a day without a sense of accomplishment and then stringing those kinds of days together. EOS 6 0 11 Okay okay. cool. That' s a helpful concept. I' m going to force myself to get up and then hopefully my body will get used to it. Yes, that' s true. I hate ending the day knowing I' ve bummed it out. EOS 6 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] One of the things I' ve noticed about 2020 and I think this contributes is that this year has taken away almost all incentives... you know before it would be like," I' m looking forward to this concert, or this movie coming out next weekend." So, when you aren' t planning things and don' t have these milestones throughout the year of events breaking up the monotony, it stinks. EOS 6 0 13 Yes, I agree. I used to go to at least one concert every year. Now that' s out of the question. It gets boring and a little depressing. Hopefully 2021 will be better. EOS 6 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m sure it will be. Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the MTurk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you. EOS 3 0 1 Not doing well. I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Oh no, how long had you been together? EOS 3 0 3 we were together for 2 years. It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Wow, that' s horrible. How do you feel about it? EOS 3 0 5 I feel lost. I' m so used to her being around everyday. Now I don' t know what to do with myself without her. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year. EOS 3 0 7 Not only that, but with Covid going on I have noone i can see to talk about it. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have any family? EOS 3 0 9 Yes, i do, but they are far away. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Friends closeby? Hobbies? What kind of work do you do? EOS 3 0 11 I do have friends, who are also friends with her. However they have families and do not visit prople because of covid. I don' t have any true hobbies. I don' t think they will fill the void anyways. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow. EOS 3 0 13 I do software development, but its a work at home situation. So i have been just by myself for the last week, and its driving me crazy. All i do is think about why she would do that. I' ve had time to myself but its not getting any better. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have always tried to think of things in a positive way. This way even when something really bad happens, it doesn' t seem so bad as to overwhelm us from recovering. EOS 3 0 15 What positive are there here? EOS 3 1 16 [Question] I' m actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it? Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren' t hurting for money. EOS 3 0 17 It' s ok. pays the bills. But my job is pretty independent. so i don' t even get to meet new people. I am usually home, while she was always out of the house during the day. EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can use that stress that has been building up to find a new outlet for the stress. EOS 3 0 19 what, you want to break stuff to relieve stress. EOS 3 1 20 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. My wife used to think I was just playing on the computer all day, lol. I run. Every morning, I jog about 2 miles. It is awesome to get the blood going and a great way to start the day. EOS 3 0 21 That sound like something i could give a try. any other seggestions? EOS 3 1 22 [Others] I feel so much more relaxed after running and it seems that nothing can hurt me after that. EOS 3 0 23 Well, i' m going try going for a run right now. Thanks for the suggestion. I' ll see if that helps. EOS 3 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I do know how a programming job can take away from some social aspects of your life, maybe try and go to a bar, or somewhere social to get out some. No problem, I hope I have helped you some. Happy Holidays!
6 0 0 I am having a really hard time with something that I did to my boyfriend. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Do you want to talk about it?

Would you mind sharing what is going on? EOS 0 0 5 Long story short, im a recovering alcoholic, 52 days sober, however my mental health has hit me with vengeance and am really struggling day to day. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You are getting out of alcoholism and feeling bad about it emotionally, is that right? EOS 0 0 7 i used alcohol as a self medication. It helped keep bad symtoms of ADHD away. I miss what alcohol used to do for me. EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I understand you pain and frustration. I have very close friend who has ADHD and trying to cope with it. EOS 0 0 9 Thankyou for allowing me some of your time. I would be so much better if my heart wasnt poorly. I could then be medicated properly. As of now i just have to live with it. Kinda sucks. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Are you seeing any counselor to address your challenge? EOS 0 0 11 I feel for your friend. EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you.. you know you are not alone in such journey...
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 0 0 2 Just feeling sad. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad? EOS 0 0 4 Not being able to leave the house with Covid. plus my hours were cut at work. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut. What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time? EOS 0 0 6 Yes it sucks. I live alone now so there really hard sometimes. I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos. Nothing productive. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it' s not the same as face to face. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I have one close friend that I talk to every now and then. Its not like it use to be. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That' s still a win. EOS 0 0 10 We used to be able to go out and have a few beers together.. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. Keep that connection. It' s not going to be the same due to the circumstances. But at least you are seeking to keep that connection, and that is a good thing. EOS 0 0 12 I hope that this vaccine thing is reason and we can get back to the norm.. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it' s not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest. EOS 0 0 14 Good idea.. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well. But I am hoping they get it right, and not just rush to get something out there that may or may not work.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues.

EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this.

Does he drink at home as well or just when you go out? EOS 3 0 8 Just when he goes out I do not go with him I do not drink and drive. And he hangs with some obnoxious people. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Would a date night at home with take - out and a movie just the two of you be an option? EOS 3 0 10 He would go to sleep, and then he thinks I am crazy he says we are no kids anymore that need to go on a date we are married.

EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can file against the company if you can prove neglect in the employer.. Were there proper safety guards. EOS 3 0 27 I tried but since it is the state of PA they have immunity. no. EOS 3 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was a state injury, there must be an avenue you can use to prove neglect. EOS 3 0 29 I was told that I assumed the risk of injury working for them. It was a mental hospital. EOS 3 1 30 [Question] have you contacted OSHA and filed a complaint with them? EOS 3 0 31 not yet. I should. EOS 3 1 32 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There should be an avenue for you to seek compensation. EOS 3 0 33 The lawyer fought with them for over a year. There was even an appeal but I lost that too. EOS 3 1 34 [Reflection of feelings] It is unfortunate that safety is not a factor. It was a state hospital? EOS 3 0 35 yes. EOS 3 1 36 [Question] Did a patient attack you? EOS 3 0 37 yes. EOS 3 1 38 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There must be liability concerning your injury.

EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is incredibly difficult to get something like this off your mind and it seems like you are trying your best to move forward with your life.
1 0 0 Hello I am having pro\ blems with a friend. EOS 1 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so so sorry to hear that. What has been going on? EOS 1 0 2 Sometimes she is very friendly, but sometimes she is super rude. In a way that is so rude that it has never happened before by someone who I consider a friend. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh wow, it sounds like shes not a very good frined. EOS 1 0 4 As nice as she is, every once in a while show will be equally nasty. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Have you tried talking to her about it? EOS 1 0 6 Super snarky comments. Yes I have tried. But it still continues. EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried seperating from her? EOS 1 0 8 I can' t she is a colleague.

EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s so hurtful. Do others feel the same as you?

EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother? EOS 1 0 3 It is why I am angry. This occurs at least every other day. I say something harmless and she thinks I am saying it in a way that is rude or something. EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you can figure out a way to communicate better. EOS 1 0 5 I do not know for sure where to start. If I try to tell her that is not what I mean it is like she doesn' t understand? EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to feel misunderstood. EOS 1 0 7 For example today I was just saying I like the food she had cooked us for supper. She took that to mean I never liked the food she made before. She says I do not appreciate her and I should be grateful to have her. EOS 1 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing your best to be nice but it isn' t getting through. EOS 1 0 9 Maybe it was the way she was brought up that she is so sensitive. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everybody has stuff from their past that affects them. EOS 1 0 11 But they should not take how they feel on others right? But I know I have to be understanding. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You should be understanding, especially since you already know this. EOS 1 0 13 Can you relate to this situation? EOS 1 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have had personal disputes with my parents in the past. Most of the time there' s other things going on that makes a person act different. EOS 1 0 15 Maybe I could just take deep breath and kind of step back a minute before I respond. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It would be good to do that. Maybe try to have a conversation and tell her you support her no matter what she' s going through.

I can' t think of anything else. I hate to tell you but I cheated on him. I am so sorry and can' t look at myself in the mirror. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That can really weigh you down, beating yourself up with guilt. Does he know about the incident? EOS 6 0 6 I feel like I am worthless and I don' t deserve to ever be happy or laugh again. I really do love him and I don' t ever want him to find out what I did. Yes, I cant stop beating myself up. He doesn' t know what I did but he is little suspicious. EOS 6 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You definitely deserve to laugh and be happy. One mistake doesn' t define you!

EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress.

EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It will not be same.. but better than being alone.. EOS 0 0 15 That' s true. I wanted to play board games online with some friends, but they weren' t interested. It' s not the same thing to play with strangers.

1 0 0 Hi. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello though, how has life been treating you lately? EOS 1 0 2 It' s been a pretty crazy year. I' m mostly bummed because of my work. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It has been a really weird year hasn' t it? Don' t worry, I think it' s been the same for all of us. Would you like to tell me more details? EOS 1 0 4 Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else' s pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss( the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That really sucks! I can understand why you are angry and anxious about this and you have every right to be!. Are there any official routes that you can use to complain? EOS 1 0 6 I work in supply chain and I see the actual sales numbers and realized 4 months ago that we were actually on track to exceed our plans, even with the covid reductions. a few weeks later I heard him tell our sales director to keep the numbers artificially low so that they will both get their bonuses. I don' t think so... He' s the VP there isn' t anyone I can go to above him. EOS 1 1 7 [Others] That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint?. It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this.
6 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there! How may I support you? EOS 6 0 2 Well, I' m really upset with my friends. EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I am so sorry to hear that. Did something happen? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, they aren' t taking COVID seriously. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns? EOS 6 0 6 Yes but they get angry with me. I don' t know how to get through to them, EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It' s also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right. EOS 6 0 8 I really don' t know I just haven' t been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out. It' s a weird dynamic. EOS 6 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you' re finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it' s the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right? EOS 6 0 10 That' s exactly right. EOS 6 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is such a hard position to be in. it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance. EOS 6 0 12 I' d like to think so but I wish they would too. It' s hard to know what is right. EOS 6 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have found that having vitural movie nights, or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected. Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try? EOS 6 0 14 Yes, but they' ll have their BBQs and parties anyway. They are having a group Thanksgiving and there will be a lot of people there. My husband and I feel bad that we aren' t going, but we also know it isn' t smart. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can' t live your life in fear, and that they' re going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware.
5 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling today? EOS 5 0 1 uninspired. broken. a rock. a static object. bananas. EOS 5 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, that' s a start. Do I hear you saying that you' re confused at the moment? EOS 5 0 3 not confused. frustrated that I have to produce art for marks when I am not inspired. EOS 5 1 4 [Question] Ah I hear you, education can be both wonderful and difficult can' t it? What are you supposed to produce? EOS 5 0 5 painting after painting. like I am an ikea machine, photocopying picasos for A' s. EOS 5 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that that is very frustrating. Would you consider switching majors? EOS 5 0 7 What is life but a stage. Art is life. I love art.. no. EOS 5 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass. Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of your future and one day it will pay off?

EOS 3 0 10 How did you snap out of the situation, did you have some savings? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Always putting money aside when able, and doing lots of research about first time businesses gave a lot of insights. Have you tried to look into things like that yourself?
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am very sorry to hear that. What are you sad about? EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently? EOS 4 0 5 It is over permanently... EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah I guess, the relationship was a little toxic and she sometimes only used me for money. Maybe is it for the best now that I think about it. EOS 4 1 8 [Others] Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!! EOS 4 0 9 Yeah I just miss having someone there for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] All you need now is to give yourself some TLC.. treat yourself to something nice and go easy on yourself. EOS 4 0 11 What is TLC.

EOS 4 0 13 Ok yeah your story is very inspirational to me. Maybe this was needed in order to find the right person. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anything you can do to distract yourself right now? Plan a holiday or take a night class or something? EOS 4 0 15 I am now doing mturk to get my mind off of it to make some extra money. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Save up what you make and buy yourself something nice? EOS 4 0 17 yeah the only problem is I am barely getting any money from this. Do you have any tips onto how I can make more money/ EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There is some very lucrative stuff out there:). Take what we are doing right now for instance.

I fell down some stairs the other day and broke my foot and chipped my two front teeth. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that. I feel you because I had an experience about breaking my bones. It was sad story. how you feel right now. EOS 3 0 5 I am grateful for my family they are taking care of me but I am on crutches and am in a boot when I am not icing my foot. EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Very good. I am glad that you have a good family who can support you whenever you need a help.

EOS 3 0 9 Thank you I appreciate that! Yes I am getting surgery like 2 days before christmas so this christmas should definitely be interesting to say the least haha.

Always try to see the bright side. EOS 3 0 11 Yes exactly. I got my teeth fixed a couple days ago as well so that was good too! I am really leaning on my family for support but just felt like asking for some outside help which is why I am talking to you right now lol. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Exactly, sometimes we need new window to see things by different ankle. So can I ask you what you want me to do or what is really need you right now?

3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is?
2 0 0 Hello. Maybe you can help me calm down. I just found out that I' m losing my job in January.( 1) EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hello! I hope I can. I am so sorry to hear that. That' s so rough. There are so many people going through this right now. EOS 2 0 2 Yes and that worries me even more. More people competing for the same jobs.( 2) EOS 2 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a fare worry but you can' t be discourged. YOu need to think positively. You can use this as a time to reconnect with family and to get your resume together.

0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m really stressed with school exams. and I' m struggling with anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Ah that sounds tough, why exactly are you stressed? EOS 0 0 4 I have 3 big exams coming up at the same time, and they' re all really important for my final grade. I know I' m going to badly because I haven' t been learning well during the pandemic. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Okay, I understand, I see how that can also make your anxiety worse. Currently, on a scale of 1 - 10 how well are you understanding your course material? EOS 0 0 6 Probably 4. My roommates are just so loud and inconsiderate, I can' t make any progress studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s completely normal you haven' t made any progress. That would make things so hard and I applaud you for coming so far with that going on! EOS 0 0 8 I guess so. But if I fail or do badly on my exams it' s really not going to be good. I' m on a scholarship and have to keep above a 3. 0 gpa. EOS 0 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Would you say your problems start with your roommates? EOS 0 0 10 They' re the biggest problem right now. But I think having to learn from home is the main problem. It' s so hard in a tiny room with just a laptop. No library, no office hours, no study groups. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand, the same goes for me. It can be hard to keep up with grade expectations especially when money is on the line. EOS 0 0 12 Are you a student too? EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] Yes, and I completely get it! Its so hard to self - manage without the right resources.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! What can I do to help? EOS 0 0 1 Hello, I' m not sure if there is any help? Without knowing when I can return to work, I will probably remain anxious about the unknown. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m glad to speak to you today. It sounds like you are having anxious thoughts. Can you tell me more? EOS 0 0 3 i am self employed, selling event tickets on the internet, but because of covid, all events are postponed until it is safe to gather in large numbers. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how you might feel anxious. There are lots of uncertainties right now. I am sorry you are going through this. Are you able to find work or help from the government? EOS 0 0 5 thank you; fortunately, i have been able to collect unemployment assistance, especially created for self employed people during this difficult time. however, that is due to expire in a few weeks, so once again i am growing anxious about finances. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Living with uncertainties can make anyone feel anxious. Have you tried getting outdoors for a small walk or hike?. EOS 0 0 7 yes, I try to walk outdoors every day, for at least 30 minutes. it does help a lot. but with the weather turning colder, that may be difficult to continue. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It is so important during stressful life events to take care of our minds and bodies. It sounds like you have been making good choices! Have you reached out to family or friends for advice or perhaps help with supplemental employment? EOS 0 0 9 not yet; it is very difficult for me to ask for help. But I may need to do so in the near future. I am fortunate to have a close network of family and friends that I can count on. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am happy to hear you have support during this time. EOS 0 0 11 i would be open to seeking other employment online; work from home on the computer. any suggestions? EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Luckily, there are many platforms online that allow you to work from home. I know of several that allow you to do side" gigs". Perhaps you can search and find a few of these. I, myself have had success doing these. EOS 0 0 13 thanks! i will check it out. in the meantime, any other suggestions for dealing with anxiety? EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Many have found meditation helps relieve anxiety. Most importantly, if you find yourself feeling depressed or worsening symptoms, please contact your medical professional.
0 0 0 Hi. Is anyone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hi there. EOS 0 0 2 Hi I thought you were not going to show. my anxiety level just increased while I was waiting for you. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Apologies, I have had issues with my connection which should now be resolved. How can I help you today. EOS 0 0 4 I am having a panic attack. I have to come up with 100 by next week to meet my minimum charge. on my credit card. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you need to find 100, have limited time to do this and this is causing you anxiety as a result? EOS 0 0 6 yes it sure is. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, I can tell you are really worried about this and want to find a way to remove the pressure from this situation. EOS 0 0 8 yes any suggestion s. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any friends or family that you can speak to about this? If they were aware of this issue and how much it is affecting you, they may be able to support. EOS 0 0 10 They are swamped with their own bills and we live pay check to pay check. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried contacting the credit card company and explaining your situation? EOS 0 0 12 No I haven' t but if i don' t pay minimum I will get 24% interest penalty. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] that seems excessive. I had a similar situation happened myself once and what I did was transfer the balance of one of my cards onto another. EOS 0 0 14 It is the truth thats why I try to pay off in full but there was such a great deal. but thats a great idea and would give me a little extra time. Thank you. I think Ill go google credit card offers. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] do you think the credit card company has acted irresponsibly?. EOS 0 0 16 no I knew the terms when I signed up a year ago. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] even so you may be able to refer this situation for review to a financial regulator. EOS 0 0 18 I like your idea of transferring to lower interest one. EOS 0 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can review your rights online as a consumer to see if you are offered any protection under law or legislation. EOS 0 0 20 okay Ill go check it out. thank you.. EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m confident that you can handle this and have every faith that you will reach a resolution. EOS 0 0 22 thank you. Keep safe and have a good night. EOS 0 1 23 [Greeting] Your welcome.
0 0 0 hey. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m good, busy. I need another job to pay more bills. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having a difficult time with your finances. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 yes somewhat. i can pay it off within 2 - 3 years without a second job. id like to pay it off faster though. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure it will take dedication and hard work, but I bet you can do it! EOS 0 0 6 I think so. Im doing mturk for a second job right now. it helps some. i don' t know about getting another job. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been in your shoes and also feel that' s a good way to add a little extra income. It can really add up if left to built and used towards a specific goal. EOS 0 0 8 I agree 100%. Been spending it on new clothes and toiletries lately to stock up for the covid shutdown. the extra money helps alot. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It definitely can help. Perhaps you could have a separate way of using some of the money to go towards some of the other bills you would like to pay off? Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns. EOS 0 0 10 i currently do that. it' s hard to have the patience to pay it off. i hate having debt hanging over my head. i like to have nice things though and they cost money. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Yes, and I have found this can be a good way to provide for the extra luxuries we like, without taking away from money that' s used towards household bills. EOS 0 0 12 absolutely. i make sure all of my household bills are paid every month. i think it will get better once these debts are paid off. i needed a lot of new things at once since the old had worn out. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to use some of the scripts that can be added that allows you to catch hits that are hard to get on Mturk? They can be very helpful. Also, there are forums that have all kinds of useful information for workers. EOS 0 0 14 no i haven' t tried those yet. do i have to pay for those scripts? EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You might find it useful to do a little research and add them as extensions to Chrome or whatever browser you use. They are free and pretty simple to use.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 I am fine thank you. How are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am very well. Do you have any problems you' d like to discuss with me? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I am having trouble figuring out how to handel a situation with a friend. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah, can you give me a few more details? I am sure I will be able to help/ EOS 0 0 5 Her husband was justshot and kiled over a drug deal. He was high on drugs at the time. My dayghter and his daughter are good friends and we carpool with them every day. He was often the driver not my friend. Was he high when he was driving my daughter arround? Did my friend know he was on drugs? EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow that is a tough one - I can see why you would be concerned about it. At least, though, you can be assured that she is safe and is never going to come to any harm as a result of his driving now. EOS 0 0 7 Agreed but it is hard to not be suspicious that the mom knew something about hi actions. Yet I feel horrible that she lost her husband. EOS 0 1 8 [Others] I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it:( EOS 0 0 9 I know. I am trying to be supportive and help her with her kids but a part of me is still anxious that she may have played me. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] People can hold values that to other people seem strange. She might not have considered it wrong to be driving on drugs, even though it is. EOS 0 0 11 Very true. I really never even considered that! EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would not make it acceptable though!

Do you have any tips onto how I can make more money/ EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There is some very lucrative stuff out there:). Take what we are doing right now for instance. EOS 4 0 19 I mean 15 minutes for 2$ doesn' t seem very lucrative. but I guess it ads up. EOS 4 1 20 [Question] beats flipping burgers;). So, what are you going to do to get yourself back onto the dating market? EOS 4 0 21 I am going to wait for this whole covid thing to end and then get a real job and once I fix my financial situation I will start dating again. EOS 4 1 22 [Others] Ah yes, the world feels like it' s on hold at the moment doesn' t it? Probably not a good time to start sharing germs with new people: D. EOS 4 0 23 Yeah exactly and I have more pressing matters at hand than a girlfriend because like I said, I am in need of money right now since. EOS 4 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' ll be around for ages if you want to talk some more on here! EOS 4 0 25 I think talking to you has benefited me a lot so thank you for that.

Online dating is definitely the way to go these days. EOS 4 0 31 yeah it really makes it easy to meet new people. EOS 4 1 32 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not like when I was younger when the internet was just taking off. Internet dating was seen as weird then.

EOS 6 0 14 I think I could improve it. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you talked to someone in your family and see if they could help you with your resume to improve it. EOS 6 0 16 I' ve asked some friends, I think a friend will help me out when he' s not busy. EOS 6 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient. EOS 6 0 18 Yes I know.

EOS 6 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] all you can honestly really do right now is to try to improve your resume and see if that helps any and just keep searching for jobs and putting in applications and i know you will get a call from a job soon. yes it has been a bad year for anything to happen.

3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 I am well, thanks for asking. I am doing some studying and taking a break now. Just to talk about some of the feelings, thoughts, and stresses. The big thing on my mind now is the pandemic. And it' s the start of the second wave in my city.. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand what you are going though, indeed it is tough times. EOS 3 0 4 yeah it sure has been since March this year for my city. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So tell me, what are you going through your mind regarding the pandemic and the second wave? EOS 3 0 6 There' s kind of a lag as I am on the East Coast. So the cases didn' t really show up for the second wave until this month, only sporadically last month. But we were doing now until about two to three weeks ago. well fear, anxiety. worries, and also anger that people are being foolish and complacent, especially the youth groups that go to gyms and restaurants a lot, or to gatherings. even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, I don' t know and it just boggles on my mind.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I understand, I' m from the east coast and I' m deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown. EOS 3 0 8 I get that there' s a fatigue but I was there and I had that fatigue and I got over that a few months ago late summer when I tried to reason myself that it was safe to go out when there weren' t any cases then, as the first w ave was gone from my city. I see. Yeah I feel you definitely. like people are becoming impatient but this is not the right time to be. If I can overcome that initial impatience, others should also. If they have no right reason to be out except for work and personal business, then I don' t think they should be doing that too much.. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I think those who are aware of the situation should follow the rules and be aware. We really can' t change the situation because it human nature. EOS 3 0 10 it is. And that' s sad but true. It' s in our nature, as you say. It' s in our nature to destroy and to consume, etc. unfortunate but I can only cope by doing what I feel is right, and continue to do so. and not compromise my values along with others. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] However, we shouldn' t let it affect us physically, spiritually and most importantly mentally. We need stay relax and be aware of whats going on and believe that by following the rules we are doing our part in reducing the speard. EOS 3 0 12 yes I agree also. It' s hard though and it was getting to me even more middle of this year. I was more affected and more emotional. So I do see that I am getting used to it, though how long is uncertain, as the cases rise again. So hopefully I can stay well mentally. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Every night, I give myself an hour to unwind and relax. Things like, enjoying a movie, snack, drink or even favorite candle helps a lot.. EOS 3 0 14 and yeah, that' s the best we can do for now, as you say, is follow the rules and science, and do our part.. ignore the naysayers and compromisers. that' s really good. the relaxation technique, I mean. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Exactly, keep calm and relax. Avoid any negative vibes. Aim is to distress yourself. EOS 3 0 16 yeah I take time every now and then off from my studies, but my schedules are not set or consistent, and I procrastinate a lot. So that when I fall behind on a typical day, I try to catch up and end up not having enoug h time to even work out at home, or feel tired and sleepy, when I should have finished with my academic work early in the day. yeah that' s good advice. I will keep trying to tune out and filter the negativity and daily news. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m on the same boat. Build yourself a well structure schedule and aim to follow it. Trust me if accomplish 90% of it, that one hour me time will feel even better. EOS 3 0 18 so yeah, just aimless and procrastinate often, and need more self - imposed structure, discipline, maturity, organization, time - management, etc.. yeah good idea. like I am only lately gaining ground and staying on track so I am improving on this. yeah I should be like that too, something like having an hour to look forward to towards the end as a reward of some sort.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Any improvement is still improvement! EOS 3 0 20 true. My courses are nearly finished anyhow by the end of december. So after that, I will revamp my style in the new year and start anew. Anyhow that' s all for now. I think you have provided some very valuable advice. And I will keep those in my mind on a daily basis. EOS 3 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] No problem! Don' t stress and just work on improving yourself!
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 1 0 1 I could be better. How about U? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] I am doing well. Whats bothering you? EOS 1 0 3 A friend screwed me out of money and a business venture. I am no longer friends with her. We were really close before this.. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! I am so sorry that has happened to you. That must feel like such a betrayal. Can you tell me more about it? EOS 1 0 5 It does. I' ve known her for 14 years and we dated. I invested a lot of money in a business she wanted to do. She took the money and ran. EOS 1 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back. EOS 1 0 7 What do you suggest? EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Did you sign anything? or have proof of what happened? EOS 1 0 9 No. Other than the money I transferred to her. Hello? EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What was the business? It depends on your location but I' m sure just on the transaction alone that shows some kind of intent. or text messages saying it was for a specific purpose? EOS 1 0 11 A cat cafe. Where you can hang out and work or drink with adoptable cats from the local shelter.. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you gave her a large amount of money and have any kind of messages about it I would look into trying to get it back.
0 0 0 Good afternoon. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Good afternoon. how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I am not good at all. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] oh no. I am sorry, what happened?
2 0 0 Hello. Maybe you can help me calm down. I just found out that I' m losing my job in January.( 1) EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hello! I hope I can. I am so sorry to hear that. That' s so rough. There are so many people going through this right now.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 3 0 2 well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. My life is done now. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband. EOS 3 0 4 well, I cannot say it is a new start when I will be 90 in March. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Then you' ve definitely got a lot going for you if you' re 90! EOS 3 0 6 Had. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Why did he leave you? EOS 3 0 8 He wanted a younger woman. His new girlfriend is 63. He is 45. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that is more of his problem then. You deserve someone that' s better than leaving someone because of their age. EOS 3 0 10 I thought it would be nice to have a younger man when we got married. He eventually told me he just married me for my money, and was waiting for me to pass so he could inherit all of it. He said he got tired of waiting, so he moved on to someone else. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Personally, if that' s how he felt, then you' re better off. I know that doesn' t stop the hurt you' re feeling, but you are worth more than that. EOS 3 0 12 Now I am here alone. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being single does not mean you' re completely alone. There are a lot of resources to talk to someone and make friends. EOS 3 0 14 I am looking on Tinder for a new friend, but nobody wants someone that is 90. I never used it before, but someone told me about it. Considering I haven' t dated in 25 years. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could you try something like Facebook or Instagram to connect with old friends or acquaintances? EOS 3 0 16 What are those? I heard of them, but never used them. Most of my old friends are no longer around... EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Social networks online, you can connect with family or old coworkers. And post pictures and see what other people are doing with their lives. EOS 3 0 18 I am looking for something quicker, I don' t know how much longer I have. I can' t be spending months waiting for the right person. EOS 3 1 19 [Question] So you' re looking for a strictly romantic relationship? EOS 3 0 20 well.... someone to spend time with. My great grandson said people meet others on Tinder now. Told me I should try it. Have you heard of it or used it? EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Can you go to the park? Maybe visit there to meet new people? EOS 3 0 22 Possibly. My cats don' t like to have a leash on them though. EOS 3 1 23 [Others] I' ve never used it, not sure if Tinder is the right place to meet someone to spend time with. Not always the best intentions.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi my name is Sarah, how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hi, Sarah. I am at my wits end. I feel like I am going crazy. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That sounds stressful. What' s happening? EOS 0 0 3 I am stressed out about having to move and I just can' t seem to calm down when it is time to sleep.. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Moving is such a stressful time. When do you move?. EOS 0 0 5 I am moving in a month, but there is just so much to do before then. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. What is your wind - down routine like in the evening, if you have one?
2 0 0 Good evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hi, how' s things? EOS 2 0 2 Things are ok I am just having issues with the problem above. EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I am afraid that I am not able to see that.. can you tell me about it? EOS 2 0 4 Yes, so I have always done very well in school and university. I have always had A' s or high B' s. Last semester in university, I failed one of my exams. I still passed the class with an A, but for some reason, that exam haunts me and gives me bad dreams. I don' t know why it happens and it worries me. EOS 2 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that - when I was sitting my final exams I constantly had nightmares about failing. Nearly thirty years on and I still do!! But - you did really very well and you passed with an A. Do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself? EOS 2 0 6 Maybe, I got a 46% on the exam( so an F) but I did all my other assignments and exams almost perfect and got an A overall. I never once failed a test in my life, and have always held myself to a very high academic degree to make my parents proud. I come from a poor family, so succeeding in life is very important to m, e. me* EOS 2 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds as though you feel that academic success is the most important thing in your life, would I be right in thinking this? EOS 2 0 8 Yes you are correct. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered talking to anyone about these feelings of perfectionism? A therapist perhaps? There is a good deal of useful help and information out there for people who are struggling. EOS 2 0 10 I have not, actually. I don' t think my family can afford a therapist, especially with the pandemic raging right now. Where do you recommend going? EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Does your school have any counsellors offering help for free? Many do. I believe that there are some charities that will offer a certain number of free therapy sessions too. EOS 2 0 12 I don' t think any are available since my school is online only, also the campus i s completely closed due to Winter Break. Oh? Charities? EOS 2 1 13 [Others] Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you. EOS 2 0 14 I have never heard of such people, I am interested. EOS 2 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Really though I think that your problem is self esteem.. you should think better of yourself:) I can tell that you set yourself a very high standard but I also think that you need to be kind to yourself.
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave? EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad. EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more. I feel that everyone must know that I' ve been dumped and be laughing at me. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time. EOS 1 0 10 I did not really have any choice though. I do not see any future for myself now that we are separated. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] do you know brene brown and her work. EOS 1 0 12 No I do not, who is that? EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her TED talk and there' s a great youtube video on empathy. EOS 1 0 14 Thank you, I will. Right now I really need some sort of emotional support. I feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i bring her up because what i sounds like is that you are feeling embarrassed because your partner made a choice that wasn' t you. in reality the choice they made wasn' t about you, it was about them. EOS 1 0 16 It is not so much that - it is that I feel that I dedicated the majority of my adult life to this relationship and now there is nothing left. EOS 1 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are left and you are enough. even if you dont feel like it right now you are enough. EOS 1 0 18 I really do not feel like it right now. What was the last fifteen years all about? I wanted to have children with him and he refused but now I hear he is expecting a baby with another woman. EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] a relationship is part of who you are. it isn' t you. EOS 1 0 20 But it is very difficult to try to strike out on my own again and I do not know if I even want to. EOS 1 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it is hard. it sucks. but the voyage through the suck is going to be better for you than you may realize right now.
3 0 0 hello. anyone there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with today? EOS 3 0 2 am not fine. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What is it that is making you feel this way? EOS 3 0 4 i was cheated on severally, and it resulted me to end the relationship. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you had to deal with a partner recently cheating and a breakup, is this right? EOS 3 0 6 yes thats it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this has been stressful for you and you are trying to figure out how to move on from this. EOS 3 0 8 exactly, i can tend to focus because i have given so much time and affection, i never thought i would be called the fool after everything i did. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is incredibly difficult to get something like this off your mind and it seems like you are trying your best to move forward with your life. EOS 3 0 10 i want to move on but i dont know how, i tried to but i just cant. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I have been through this, I learned how to keep myself busy and do things that I enjoy to occupy my mind and let time heal those wounds.
4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out. EOS 4 0 6 I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night?
3 1 0 [Question] Good evening! What can I help you with tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I am dealing with pandemic depression. We are completely isolated. Can' t see friends, family, hug grandkids... EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] That is extremely understandable. The pandemic is an event no one was prepared for, and it has cause unforseen upheavals.. That is a tough situation, being isolated physically from those that you love. I' m sorry you' re going through that. EOS 3 0 3 It' s been going on for months with no end in sight. EOS 3 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are you at least able to maintain contact through text and video chats?. EOS 3 0 5 How do you deal with it? Yes, some video chats, but not the same. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, I make sure I continue to maintain my relationships as well as possible through the avenues I have available. It is definitely not the same, but it' s what we have at the moment. Personally, I try to maintain a routine. First hour after I wake up is coffee time, coffee and social media scroll time. EOS 3 0 7 Then there is my wife. She is very paranoid about the virus. She sanitizes the house even though no one comes in it. Bitches at me. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] That sounds very stressful, I' m sorry to hear that..
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 I am well, thanks for asking. I am doing some studying and taking a break now.

0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hi. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] how are you? EOS 3 0 3 Not too good sadly:/ EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I' m sorry. what' s going on? EOS 3 0 5 My and my long term boyfriend just ended. Turns out he was cheating on me for the past 3 months with his best friend:( EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] whoa, that' s pretty messed up! how long were you together? EOS 3 0 7 Tell me about! We were planning on moving in together next year. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, I definitely wouldn' t go through with that then. Are you sure he was cheating? EOS 3 0 9 I noticed a few signs and confronted him about it. He didn’t even deny it! He wasn’t remorseful at all... it’s like he doesn’t even love me. How can you love someone yet betray the, somquiclu. So quickly** EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] did he admit to it? I would agree that he probably doesn' t feel the way you want him to. EOS 3 0 11 Not at all. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] but you know for certain? EOS 3 0 13 Yes HE ADMITTED IT. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] oh gotcha. yeah that is really messed up. how long were you two together? EOS 3 0 15 We were together for 3 years. I don’t know how he could just toss it down the drain. EOS 3 1 16 [Question] That' s horrible. Have you been able to talk to friends about it? EOS 3 0 17 No, that’s why I’m talking to u. I haven’t been able to eat or sleep in a few days. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Do you have any friends who you can talk to it about it? Some people around you who know you really well? EOS 3 0 19 No he was my everything. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You definitely need to eat and sleep even though you don' t feel like it. You have to take care of yourself even though it feels hard. Guys are a dime a dozen. I don' t know what that really means but I think it has something to do with being able to get guys easily.
0 1 0 [Question] hello how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hello I am taking a break from my studies to talk. I am fine thanks. Hope you are doing well also. I am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines. EOS 0 1 2 [Self-disclosure] i am fine thanks for asking. EOS 0 0 3 two exams and two assignments due at the end of this and next month. that' s good. EOS 0 1 4 [Others] Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful. EOS 0 0 5 yeah I have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it' s online and basically I do things on my own time.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you taking a lot of courses? EOS 0 0 7 2 courses. but I am pretty much using full time capacity on them. devoting full - time I mean. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] do you like doing school online better than in person? EOS 0 0 9 Have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good the more time you have to devote the better!
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello. I need some help. I have been depressed. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you doing today? Do have anything on your mind? Oh i see, well we can talk about that if you like. Has anything happened recently to make you feel this way?
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed! EOS 7 0 7 And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that' s one method I have used.. Thank you for your trust in me.. EOS 7 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don' t overdo it.. EOS 7 0 9 I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible. true, very true.. Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen? EOS 7 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you. EOS 7 0 11 Thanks for sympathizing and understanding.. EOS 7 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation. EOS 7 0 13 ok. That' s true and I have to do more of that. Phone is also a big distraction for me. I heard that it' s best to get it out of one' s reach for best results.. Timer, great idea.. EOS 7 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I struggl ed with focus but once I put my phone away, my focus increased a lot. EOS 7 0 15 I think that' s pretty good advice. I know which room I can do this, but just away from temptation plus having an alarm from the other room to go off after an hour or so of reading. ok, I will employ these methods more.. Thank you for sharing these. EOS 7 1 16 [Question] Of course! Is anything else on your mind? EOS 7 0 17 then hopefully after these two courses are done, I can have renewed faith and maturity after the new year and take new courses with better results.. not much, just academic pressure and how to deal with time management and being contentious.. EOS 7 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, that sounds like a great idea. It sounds like you' re really trying to help yourself grow. EOS 7 0 19 Yes I hope so, because when I was younger, I used to be great at not being distracted so much in my studies and just bang it out real quick and well with my books. and all this is also worsened by the pandemic, I am afraid, of just not having a renewed from the indoor isolation.. EOS 7 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, it' s true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood. I understand how you' re feeling, COVID has affected me negatively as well but I' m just trying to look at the bright side. EOS 7 0 21 yes it has on us all. I guess the other thing is that my city has been doing fine so far, but just the past two weeks or so has been more and more cases, so just getting stressed and depressed with that and prospects of a second shut down.. so yes, the second wave is here it seems( belatedly), but hopefully it doesn' t get worse, because I have seen worse in other places right now. EOS 7 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I would suggest taking up yoga or meditation to lessen the stress COVID has on your brain. EOS 7 0 23 so I suppose just trying to cope with that also because I get nervous having to go out for work or errands, and I also have to write my exam outside of my home.. ok. I could look into that. I work out in general, but have been slacking off on those ever since the pandemic started this year.. EOS 7 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I' d recommend wearing a mask whenever you go out to lessen the chance of you contracting anything. At the moment, it' s all we could do. EOS 7 0 25 yes and I have been and will continue to do that.. EOS 7 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s great!
4 0 0 I just lost my job and am worried about paying the bills. EOS 4 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills. EOS 4 0 2 There is just too much pressure, but I have to succeed. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is hard having so much pressure but I think you will be able to soon get employed again. EOS 4 0 4 I am trying. I' ve started looking online for new positions but it is a process. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise. EOS 4 0 6 I just still am continually nervous and having a hard time coping. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes deep breaths help people calm down. Have you tried that at all?
0 0 0 Hello. Feeling low today. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it. EOS 0 0 2 I' ve been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn' t go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint? EOS 0 0 4 Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don' t have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions. EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress. EOS 0 0 6 Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products. I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. Challenging face - to - face, and I have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now. What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with this evening?. EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very depressed lately. Like a constant pressure that i don' t know exactly what it is. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I' m very sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 4 0 3 I think the days getting shorter makes it worse. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating. EOS 4 0 5 Do you have any tips on how to overcome it? EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help. I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through Instagram. I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while.. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up. I like to stay up, but when it' s time to get up i dread it. Bad cycle. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sure, that' s understandable. There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin D, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them.. EOS 4 0 9 Time is the fire in which we burn. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] Now that is intractable. EOS 4 0 11 Lol... yes it is. The pandemic heightens all our awareness of time and mortality. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes, to me, the enormity of the universe is calming to my anxiety. Being assured that I mean absolutely nothing is nice sometimes. EOS 4 0 13 And drives the civil unrest which makes me feel anxious and insecure. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] Not in a scary, better - off - dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion. I' m a flea to the universe. EOS 4 0 15 Yes i find that a strangly comforting thought. EOS 4 1 16 [Others] ... then you have to wonder, what are fleas thinking?!. EOS 4 0 17 They have the luxury of instinct without having to" think" at all. EOS 4 1 18 [Others] God, tell me more, lol.
0 0 0 Hello? Is anyone there? Is anyone there. HELLO? no one is supporting me here..:: twiddles thumbs:: the instructions for the support seeker are incorrect as there is no button that has shown for" the partner' s reasons".. the supporter did not respond. This test is skewed. No one is here to chat with. even after being matched. Ridiculous. hello????? hello? no other messages except my own are showing up. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Sorry, I had a bad connection. Hello, what can I help you with? EOS 0 0 2 Hi. i wasn' t sure anyone was there. i left my job about three months after 8 years.. haven' t found another one.. trying to find one has been challenging. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Just be clear, you' re worried about finding a new job? EOS 0 0 4 well, yeah. in the middle of a pandemic, and being in a new town. all of that has been really hard. and stressful. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a difficult position to be in. It is a hard time, but there' s always a way to persevere. EOS 0 0 6 yeah... i don' t know... i' m not sleeping well because i' m so worried. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I could imagine that being a constant worry. I understand how you may feel. EOS 0 0 8 thanks for trying to understand. it just seems pretty hopeless. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] No problem. I am encountering a similar situation, looking for a well suited job. Have you tried looking in to new career fields that have always interested you? EOS 0 0 10 Yeah, I am looking in a variety of fields. not much out there that is remote. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are a lot of jobs in technology where the only requirement is learning a few courses, such as programming. EOS 0 0 12 that would be cool. i really enjoy tech. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It would be nice to work in a field that you also enjoy! EOS 0 0 14 yes it would.. just don' t have much energy to keep turning in cover letters and resumes.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It can seem hopeless right now, but think about how you felt when you were in a better position.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 3 0 2 well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. My life is done now. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband. EOS 3 0 4 well, I cannot say it is a new start when I will be 90 in March. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Then you' ve definitely got a lot going for you if you' re 90! EOS 3 0 6 Had. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Why did he leave you? EOS 3 0 8 He wanted a younger woman. His new girlfriend is 63. He is 45. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that is more of his problem then. You deserve someone that' s better than leaving someone because of their age. EOS 3 0 10 I thought it would be nice to have a younger man when we got married. He eventually told me he just married me for my money, and was waiting for me to pass so he could inherit all of it. He said he got tired of waiting, so he moved on to someone else. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Personally, if that' s how he felt, then you' re better off. I know that doesn' t stop the hurt you' re feeling, but you are worth more than that. EOS 3 0 12 Now I am here alone. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being single does not mean you' re completely alone. There are a lot of resources to talk to someone and make friends. EOS 3 0 14 I am looking on Tinder for a new friend, but nobody wants someone that is 90. I never used it before, but someone told me about it. Considering I haven' t dated in 25 years. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could you try something like Facebook or Instagram to connect with old friends or acquaintances? EOS 3 0 16 What are those? I heard of them, but never used them. Most of my old friends are no longer around... EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Social networks online, you can connect with family or old coworkers. And post pictures and see what other people are doing with their lives. EOS 3 0 18 I am looking for something quicker, I don' t know how much longer I have. I can' t be spending months waiting for the right person. EOS 3 1 19 [Question] So you' re looking for a strictly romantic relationship? EOS 3 0 20 well.... someone to spend time with. My great grandson said people meet others on Tinder now. Told me I should try it. Have you heard of it or used it? EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Can you go to the park? Maybe visit there to meet new people? EOS 3 0 22 Possibly. My cats don' t like to have a leash on them though. EOS 3 1 23 [Others] I' ve never used it, not sure if Tinder is the right place to meet someone to spend time with. Not always the best intentions. EOS 3 0 24 why? EOS 3 1 25 [Others] People are not always who they say they are.
3 0 0 I am so stressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi, what' s going on? EOS 3 0 2 I have a college course in the evening, but I cannot concentrate while distance learning. I am expected to watch the instructor do excel on a tiny phone screen and follow along. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oooff that sounds brutal... especially the excel part! do you have a bigger screen you can use? EOS 3 0 4 It is stressful. I am able to pull up zoom on my laptop, but it is almost more cumbersome because I must switch back and forth. I have to also manipulate an excel as well as watch the instructor. My colleagues in the class are annoying, because they do not know how to use mute correctly. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have access to a second screen or have the ability to stream the class on your tv through chromecast or something? EOS 3 0 6 I don' t have a second screen, but I do have a large TV. I may be able to hook it up via HDMI. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The mute thing is horrible. I have no ideas for that. hahah. I' m looking for help with that too! Yeah try the HDMI hook up you can sometimes find cheap attachements on amazon if you don' t have the right connections.
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability. EOS 3 0 21 i applied for disability but didn' t get it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself. EOS 3 0 23 yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn' t matter. EOS 3 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Social Security stopped you. Why? EOS 3 0 25 i' m not injured enough for them. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can file against the company if you can prove neglect in the employer.. Were there proper safety guards. EOS 3 0 27 I tried but since it is the state of PA they have immunity. no. EOS 3 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was a state injury, there must be an avenue you can use to prove neglect.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim.

EOS 0 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] You may feel a little apprehensive to get started. EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, I am. I know I can do it. Not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have been in the same position before and came out successful in the end. EOS 0 0 15 Wow, That' s great. How did you start?. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I just decided. EOS 0 0 17 What gave you the strength to go forward? I have this nervousness about getting rejected.. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing little things every day. EOS 0 0 19 So, keep myself busy and try to ignore my nervousness? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Really adds up and helps to get the big picture moving. EOS 0 0 21 OK, so with, well, kinf0f like baby steps.... right. EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It is about making small adjustments to feed a good habit. EOS 0 0 23 Build up my confidence and not take things personally.

4 0 0 I feel sad, and feel like need help. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you identify why you feel sad? EOS 4 0 2 yes, my aunt pass away a couple weeks ago. and since then im feeling really sad. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is natural to feel sad when someone you care about dies. EOS 4 0 4 IS there something I can do to feel better? EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are you with family? Sometimes it helps to be with others who are grieving? EOS 4 0 6 No, I live alone, my family lives in another state. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being by yourself is rough after a death. Can you talk with your family by phone? Do you have a friend who has gone through a similar loss? EOS 4 0 8 I feel like everybody is in their own bussines and have no time to hear my complains. I talk to my family, but the whole family is not doing really fine. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you feel people think you are complaining when you talk about your Aunt' s death making you sad. Is that correct? EOS 4 0 10 yes. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Do you feel you are complaining? EOS 4 0 12 yes, I feel like noone wants to listen. I need to do something by mnyself. Can you recommend someting for me to do to feel better? EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] My own experiences with family deaths is they are sad. I just wanted to" feel better". My experience was it did not help to complain about" being sad" but it did help to talk about why I missed my family member. If no one was available, sometimes I would journal. Do you think that might help you? EOS 4 0 14 Well maybe it could works, to mantain distracted. thank you. EOS 4 1 15 [Greeting] You are welcome. I am sorry about your Aunt.
3 0 0 Hello. Hello? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hey how are you doing?. EOS 3 0 2 Doing alright, thanks. Yourself? EOS 3 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing fine, thank you.. EOS 3 0 4 Good to hear. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 6 I' ve been feeling very down lately. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] That sounds difficult, Would you like to elaborate on that? EOS 3 0 8 Sure. I feel depressed about the state of the US and of the rest of the world. It' s very overwhelming.. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now. EOS 3 0 10 Yes and a lot of uncetainty. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Most definitely, I' ve also been feeling a bit overwhelmed by what' s going on. How have you been coping? EOS 3 0 12 It' s good to know others feel the way I do. I' ve been trying to keep busy and not watch the news too much. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a good strategy, all the news outlets can be very overwhelming. EOS 3 0 14 Yes with lots of conflicting information. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] What do you like to do to keep busy?
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday? EOS 6 0 2 I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I' m too scared to do anything about it as I don' t want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can' t help it. EOS 6 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through. EOS 6 0 4 Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I' m a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self - respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it. EOS 6 0 6 What happened out of interest when you had the conversation? EOS 6 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist. Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more. Since that time, he denies everything. EOS 6 0 8 I know. I' m a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It' s superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas' punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends.. EOS 6 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly, its not anyone else' s business. IF you' re suspicions are in fact correct, then you' ve got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart - breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she' s cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o= is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER! Curiously, why do you think she' s cheating? EOS 6 0 10 I' m almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two.. EOS 6 1 11 [Question] Hmm... So have you two live together? How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation? EOS 6 0 12 That' s just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven' t approached it with her because I' m scared see will just leave and I' ll be a laughing stock. I suppose I' m a joke either way! EOS 6 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There' s always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations. EOS 6 0 14 very true. I suppose I have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think I should just talk to her? EOS 6 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful... I only want to help you.. EOS 6 0 16 not at all. I appreciate your candour. EOS 6 1 17 [Question] But if you feel as though you' re a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you' re getting hurt? I know that you don' t want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty?
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, I' m pretty much down. trying to keep my head afloat. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] im sorry to hear that. Would you care to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 3 0 3 I lost my job some months back and it hasn' t really been easy for me.

EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave? EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad. EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more. I feel that everyone must know that I' ve been dumped and be laughing at me. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time. EOS 1 0 10 I did not really have any choice though. I do not see any future for myself now that we are separated. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] do you know brene brown and her work. EOS 1 0 12 No I do not, who is that? EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her TED talk and there' s a great youtube video on empathy. EOS 1 0 14 Thank you, I will. Right now I really need some sort of emotional support. I feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i bring her up because what i sounds like is that you are feeling embarrassed because your partner made a choice that wasn' t you. in reality the choice they made wasn' t about you, it was about them. EOS 1 0 16 It is not so much that - it is that I feel that I dedicated the majority of my adult life to this relationship and now there is nothing left. EOS 1 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are left and you are enough. even if you dont feel like it right now you are enough. EOS 1 0 18 I really do not feel like it right now. What was the last fifteen years all about? I wanted to have children with him and he refused but now I hear he is expecting a baby with another woman. EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] a relationship is part of who you are. it isn' t you. EOS 1 0 20 But it is very difficult to try to strike out on my own again and I do not know if I even want to. EOS 1 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it is hard. it sucks. but the voyage through the suck is going to be better for you than you may realize right now. EOS 1 0 22 But I feel that I am facing middle age on my own and I really do not want to do that. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you have survived 14 days without a bad relationship. keep on doing that day by day and before you know it, you will be on the other side of the bad feelings. EOS 1 0 24 What happens if I just can' t ever get over it though? Right now it' s hard to see any sort of way through these feelings. EOS 1 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, middle age is scary, but there are so many things you can do. ageism is out. EOS 1 0 26 I feel I might have missed out on my chance to have a family of my own though, because I waited fifteen years and my partner would not go for that. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] please watch the cartoon animals and brene brown on youtube talk about empathy. find one of your friends who has been through the suck and let them help you find your path out. EOS 1 0 28 Most of my friends seem to be very happily coupled up right now. They are sympathetic but they do not really understand. EOS 1 1 29 [Self-disclosure] i had an emergency ovary removal in my early 30s and didn' t know if i woudl be able to have children. my doctor told me that the most important thing i could do was to be healthy becuse a healthy mother was what i could give my children even if i adopted them. EOS 1 0 30 That sounds like very good advice from both you and your doctor. It is a difficult thing to have to confront though. I really do appreciate the fact that you have taken the time to talk honestly with me. EOS 1 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you want an empathetic friend. nobody has gone through the exact same thing you have but the emotions are common ones. you will be ok, even if you dont feel that way now.
0 1 0 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today? EOS 0 0 1 I am so stressed out because my business has suffered this year. I am very worried I may have to close and I won' t be able to pay my bills. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is really tough. a lot of people are going through that, you are not alone. what kind of business do you have? EOS 0 0 3 I sell cosmetics. I think a lot of people don' t have money to buy non essential items right now. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] christmas is right around the corner though, and it is almost the 15th. military get paid the 1st and 15th so there is still hope for a christmas rush! tax season is right around the corner too... there is defineately still reason to keep hope.
1 0 0 hi there. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hi! Hope you are doing well. How can I help you today? EOS 1 0 2 I am having such a hard time falling asleep at night.... I toss and turn and cannot shut my mind off. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep. Hope I get it right? EOS 1 0 4 yes that' s right. my mind just races thinking about problems it seems. I am irritable and frustrated. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Is there a specific thing or task which is bothering you for long? EOS 1 0 6 I worry about my daughter, she has addictions. I never know if she is okay or not, she doesn' t call me very often and is hard to get a hold of. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It must be a tough time for you and is a enough reason to not getting good sleep. despite of it you should need a complete rest. EOS 1 0 8 Have you any suggestions to help me get to sleep easier? I have tried meditation, but it doesn' t seem to help much. EOS 1 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I feels like you are having less energy and feel tired due to lack of sleep. Try to follow a particular schedule and u can put soothing music before bed. It might calm you down and make you sleep. EOS 1 0 10 That' s a good idea I can try that. My bedtimes are kind of mixed up, maybe setting a particular schedule will help, I' ll try that. sometimes i go to be early, sometimes late, maybe that is screwing me up. EOS 1 1 11 [Self-disclosure] When I have sleeping problem, I take warm shower. It help me a lot.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there! What would you like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 1 I am trying to be fine and you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] It may be helpful to know.. my name is Ann. I am 43 years old... and I know for myself, I enjoy talking to people when I have concerns. What is going on? EOS 0 0 3 Thank you for your concern, I am just worried. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What has you worried? I know right now... its a hard time for so many people. I have struggled with my own anxiety the past few weeks. EOS 0 0 5 Sorry about that. This is about my relationship. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah.... relationship worries can be so draining and emotionally exhausting. I can understand that. In your relationship, what has happened to create your worries?
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 6 0 1 hi. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing? EOS 6 0 3 Well I' m distraught. EOS 6 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel that way? EOS 6 0 5 Because my girlfriend has left me. EOS 6 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard for you. I haven' t personally had to deal with that, but I have had friends that have. How long were you together? EOS 6 0 7 four years. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being together that long must have made that break up difficult. How are you coping with it? EOS 6 0 9 well I' m not really, especially as she' d gone off with someone else. But I' m to blame which makes it worse. EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened? EOS 6 0 11 I cheated on her on a drunken night. It was a one - off and I regret it terribly. But she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain. EOS 6 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I see how she would be upset. It must be difficult for you though because she didn' t give you another chance. Do you have someone to talk to about your feelings? EOS 6 0 13 yeah, I' m not saying I deserved it just wish she had. But no, not really. No - one who would understand. EOS 6 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I would have wanted a second chance too if I were in your shoes. Is this affecting you really bad? EOS 6 0 15 Yeah I feel so low. EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If your mood is affecting your daily activities, normally that means your mental health has been affected. You could always talk to a professional if it' s hard for you. EOS 6 0 17 it' s difficult though, to open up. EOS 6 1 18 [Self-disclosure] It is. But trust me, it really helps. I' ve been seeing a therapist recently actually and I love it. I don' t have to worry about judgement at all. It' s a hard step but worth it in the end. EOS 6 0 19 They won' t think I' m to blame? EOS 6 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The job of the therapist isn' t to figure out if what you did was wrong or right. It' s to help you understand your feelings and better cope. That' s why they are so great!

EOS 0 0 5 I have been retired for over 2 years and would like to return to the workforce, part - ti me. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are thinking of going back to work? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, It would help us greatly. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have the right idea already. EOS 0 0 9 There are plenty of jobs and not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will find something suitable if you keep trying. EOS 0 0 11 Thanks What do you mean? Yeah, I know this but I don' t feel it.. EOS 0 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] You may feel a little apprehensive to get started. EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, I am. I know I can do it. Not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have been in the same position before and came out successful in the end. EOS 0 0 15 Wow, That' s great. How did you start?. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I just decided. EOS 0 0 17 What gave you the strength to go forward? I have this nervousness about getting rejected.. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing little things every day. EOS 0 0 19 So, keep myself busy and try to ignore my nervousness? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Really adds up and helps to get the big picture moving. EOS 0 0 21 OK, so with, well, kinf0f like baby steps.... right. EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It is about making small adjustments to feed a good habit. EOS 0 0 23 Build up my confidence and not take things personally. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Building it in to your daily life will make you feel accomplished. EOS 0 0 25 Yeah, so true. EOS 0 1 26 [Self-disclosure] THis really helped me to get going in the past. EOS 0 0 27 I have a few ideas and go with my strength' s and abilities that I have already been successful in the past. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You will find those things that you know you want. EOS 0 0 29 Yeah, I like it. I guess I needed to just chat with someone and listen to myself. EOS 0 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] Always beleive in yourself! EOS 0 0 31 True, that is what my wonderful Wife tells me and that God has a plan for me. Thanks. EOS 0 1 32 [Greeting] You are welcome and everybody is rooting for you.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello. How can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 What should I do. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Tell me about the situation that you are facing. EOS 0 0 3 I try to find a job but there is not many. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking? EOS 0 0 5 About 6 months. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that there are a lot of job loss in the Covid time. Is your job seeking related to that? Yeah it must be very difficult. EOS 0 0 7 yes. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and I got an offer in February right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you. I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family. EOS 0 0 9 I don' t know what types of jobs that fit me. yeah, but it is still rough to get by. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] Tell me more about it if you don' t mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking? EOS 0 0 11 I worked in manufacturer. technical skill in trade school but not degree from college. EOS 0 1 12 [Others] I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position? EOS 0 0 13 I will seek for another jobs if possible but I can work on manufacturer company too. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the Covid time? EOS 0 0 15 If I can work remotely I will do it. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have been browsing job boards every now and then. There are consistently some grocery store jobs, or cashier jobs. If you don' t mind the location, I am sure you would be a good fit for these. EOS 0 0 17 The job market is very competitive. I tried but there are no responds after my interview. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I completely understand. I was looking for jobs for almost a year. I have a spreadsheet that keeps track of all the jobs I applied. Maybe only 2 or 3 percent of them replied( with an interview request, etc.) I would suggest trying applying for jobs via Linkedin, or google jobs. You can sort them by posted date. My experience is that the more recent the posting date is, the more likely they will review your application. EOS 0 0 19 Thanks, I will try more on the website you suggest. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] Previously I also registered in a few temp agencies that would place me in companies with the intension of only keeping in on board for a few months/ weeks. They can be a good gap filler as well. EOS 0 0 21 Do they charge you when you get a job? EOS 0 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] I hope I can be more helpful. I really sympathize with your situation. They would just terminate me after they have found a permanent employee on an ongoing basis. In rare situations, they would hire" temp - to - hire" with the expectation of hiring temp workers. EOS 0 0 23 Thank you, there are no many availability of what I can do and it is just out of control from nowhere. EOS 0 1 24 [Greeting] Thank you for reaching out. It really shows that you care and you are working towards the goal. I hope you succeed. EOS 0 0 25 Thank you for your kindness. EOS 0 1 26 [Self-disclosure] Happy holidays and best wishes to you.
5 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. I' m here to listen. EOS 5 0 1 The unemployment office is overwhelmed and I' m overwhelmed trying to help my family member. EOS 5 1 2 [Providing Suggestions or Information] These days all of us have this situation. I can assure you that your family can understand it. How about an online job? EOS 5 0 3 Yes, it just very frustrating. My family member has taken another restaurant job only to lose it again for the same reasons, COVID. They have been going to temp services also. EOS 5 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I also worked in a coffee house and it has been closed for this damn virus. I feel sad too. But we should go on. EOS 5 0 5 The job center' s can only help so much. And if they don' t have internet skills, then online jobs will help. EOS 5 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] This sounds good. EOS 5 0 7 So this family member gave up their apartment, moved back in with family, still fighting unemployment and going to food banks. It' s crazy. They are doing what they can but when we talk about it, it' s hard to believe in these modern times we are in such a mess. EOS 5 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I wish this virus ends soon. But believe me everyone have similar situation these days. Did they try any online job? EOS 5 0 9 No online computer skills, but they now learned where to get some basic training. EOS 5 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] This sounds good. Wish to learn soon. I am mourning for my grandpa and my uncle that they gone for the Covid. You should be happy that you have them. EOS 5 0 11 I' m so sorry. I feel a little better talking about this. My family tries to help other family members but we can only do so much. That' s when I got frustrated( helping them with unemployment) EOS 5 1 12 [Others] Money is not always a big deal honey. EOS 5 0 13 Yes, there is more to life than money. Unfortunately$ is needed for the basics. Thanks for listening and guidance. EOS 5 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Of course but having them by your side is a gift. your welcome. I wish I could help a little.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 hi. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How are you? EOS 0 0 3 Ive been better. Stressful day. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Ohh.. sorry to hear that. Would you mind sharing what is going on?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 Hi, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Greeting] Doing good.. How are you? EOS 0 0 3 I' m feeling really anxious these days. I' m finding the COVID online learning experience to be too much for me at this time. I want to stop school, but I don' t think I can afford to. I need to get done with school. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand your frustration. All of us are challenged due to COVID. EOS 0 0 5 School was always hard. Now it' s gotten harder. I think a lot of people are stressed.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] How long are you doing the online school? EOS 0 0 7 Last semester and this semester. It feels like a lot longer though. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What are you missing most? Friends? EOS 0 0 9 A balance in life. I spend so much time online. I' m always staring at a screen. I would like to get aware from the computer. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] As the vaccination started, I believe we will be back to normal soon.. EOS 0 0 11 Yeah, I can' t wait for things to return to normal. Until then, I don' t know what I can do to feel normal. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I saw some of my friends hang out in zoom... having virtual drinks.. have you tried that?
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why? EOS 4 0 8 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID - 19 lockdowns. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] How long have you been working there? EOS 4 0 10 I am very sad about this country and my work situation. For 5 years. I work in accounting. EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID - 19 really has got us all down.
4 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 4 0 2 I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age? EOS 4 0 4 He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough, both for you and him. I know it' s meaningless to tell you not to be sad, however, you can think that he' s not in a better place. EOS 4 0 6 I presume you mean now and not not;). Though I simply am not a believer. It just made me think how meaningless life was.. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn' t it? I sometimes think it' s meaningless too. EOS 4 0 8 I do not really know what to do about my feelings. They are not going away. EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I feel you, coping with losing your loved ones is never easy. In fact, it' s confusing when you grieve and even when you recover and move on. EOS 4 0 10 Do you think that people ever really recover from a significant bereavement? I think that what you said there was very wise. Maybe it' s worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened.. there is guilt that comes with that. EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t think people can completely get over that, you just get used to the pain of not having them around. EOS 4 0 12 Whilst it hurts to think about him being dead, I think that it would hurt more if I had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I just need you to know that whatever your feeling is, it' s completely normal and you shouldn' t feel guilty for having it. EOS 4 0 14 It is just - very hard. I keep thinking about all the times I disagreed with him or did not appreciate him enough and I never got to tell him how much I loved him. EOS 4 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Your dad wouldn' t want to see you grieving everyday either. You should live the way you know he' d love to see. I believe he knew you loved him regardless how much you two argued. EOS 4 0 16 I know that he did:). I had just not expected to lose him at such a comparatively young age. He did not get to enjoy his retirement! EOS 4 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] That' s sad when he spent all his time taking care of the family and yet could not enjoy his free time. EOS 4 0 18 Yes. I think it would have been easier to deal with had he not immediately descended into very bad health as soon as he retired and had had time to have some fun. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you considered seeking therapist? We almost never think of that service, but in a lot of case, people actually need help from professionals when grieving. EOS 4 0 20 I can' t really afford to have therapy at the moment. Also I know that my dad was just have considered it to be a waste of money - he was very careful with money. EOS 4 1 21 [Others] he seemed to be a great man. Instead of regretting what happened, celebrate how great of a person he was.
0 0 0 Hi. Hello, can you help me? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I hope so. What kind of problem are you having? EOS 0 0 2 I am really struggling with my studies at the moment, I am so anxious that I keep putting off my essays and worrying all the time. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are a student who is having trouble. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, I am a mature student and struggling with my course. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand how you feel. I was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school. It is very understandable that you are feeling stressed, especially with the pandemic and other issues happening. EOS 0 0 6 yes, the pandemic is making it worse. I am working as well so I am struggling juggling them all and running a house. I just don' t know how to get back on track with my studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about putting together a schedule to help you manage your time? EOS 0 0 8 How would I go about that? EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you go online, there are different templates for students. One would be a time management template where you fill in the blocks of different times of the day. Also, do you know any of your classmates that you could email or text for support? EOS 0 0 10 okay, I can see the sense in that. Have you used them before, if so would you recommend putting everything on there or keeping it flexible? I do have a couple that i could contact, I' ve been feeling really embarrassed to contact them, like they might think I am being silly. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] To start, fill in one week to see what all activities you have to do. Set aside specific time for doing your schoolwork. Try and stick with the schedule. EOS 0 0 12 Okay, one week doesn' t seem too scary. I could colour coordinate it, I like things in colour. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] . I would try it. EOS 0 0 14 Ok, do you think I should reach out to my classmates, will they think i' m being silly, I really don' t want to alienate them. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe there is a discussion board where you could be anonymous. Break your writing down in small chunks. Just brainstorm one day, for example. EOS 0 0 16 I don' t think so, however, I might just start with the template and see if that helps first. I like the idea of breaking things into the chunks. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try one thing at a time so you are not overwhelmed.
4 0 0 I feel sad, and feel like need help. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you identify why you feel sad?
0 0 0 Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, what seems to be on your mind?. EOS 0 0 2 Friends and our relationships amongst one another. Two are arguing and I want to help both. We only can facetime each other because of Corona and it is taking a toll among our group. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I see. How long have your two friends been arguing? EOS 0 0 4 It has been around 4 months now. It started slowly and now has ramped up to where it' s exploding and causing discourse among us all. One of my friends told a secret to another acquaintance outside of our group. My friend is raging over this which she should. trust was broken. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like tempers are all running pretty hot for everyone right now, is that correct? EOS 0 0 6 I believe in forgiveness, and the friend that told is very remorseful How do I help them? EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Well, it sounds like you are in a tough spot since both your friends are so mad at each other.. Why do you think your one friends shared a secret they were supposed to keep? EOS 0 0 8 The acquaintance knew something of the secret because she had experienced this before. I think my friend was more - so trying to help my other friend, not betray her. She went outside the group but not for spitrful reasons i think. EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I think I understand. Sometimes we accidentally hurt the people we love when we are trying to help. EOS 0 0 10 I want one friend to know that the other was trying to hel and nothurt, but did not think clearly when deciding where to get help from. How do I make her understand this? EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it is great that you want to actively help, it says a lot about you.
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work. EOS 4 0 14 Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn' t even want me to help her, no she doesn' t work. EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family. EOS 4 0 16 Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] How long has it been since she moved in. EOS 4 0 18 A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you thought about a housewarming gift. EOS 4 0 20 Hmm, no I didn' t think about that, that may be a good idea. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So just a week and she is settling in. EOS 4 0 22 Yes, but the home came furnished and honestly, I didn' t think there was that much to do, but maybe I should get a gift, to break the ice. EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Friendship is important maybe she needs to hear from you.
4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out. EOS 4 0 6 I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night? EOS 4 0 8 I can' t sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it' s typically late afternoon. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds like you are doing the very best you can under difficult circumstances. you should feel very proud about that.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 3 0 1 Hello. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, i feel like i am in depsression. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed?? EOS 3 0 5 My partner broke up with me impromptu. EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now. EOS 3 0 7 Exactly, that is my current situation. I feel like my entire life has been rearranged. How did you deal with them and specifically what was your coping mechanism? EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days. I slowly realised that i had put myself in slow motion and then slowly started to do things i used to do to maybe come out of it. EOS 3 0 9 True, what ways would you suggest i use to approach my situation and get out of this state? It is very pathetic really when you think of it, halting all your life activities and plans just because a relationship ended. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well i had a close friend that i was able to vent to and help me see what was important. Do you have anyone close in your life you could talk to for guidance? EOS 3 0 11 Close friends can really be helpful in such situations. Yes, i do have a close friend even though i am very poor when it comes to opening up. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see what you mean about pathetic lol. But rather than see yourself as pathetic in a negative, use that defiance to push yourself back out into the world. Start slowly with opening up, maybe even tell your friend you intent and ask them to be patient as you learn to better express your inner feelings. EOS 3 0 13 Yes, i should do that because at the end of it all i still have myself to take care of. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think youre already on the right track. I just know you can get back to you! EOS 3 0 15 Opening up is a skill that i could do better at because i have never been the open type. But with a little practice i could get better at it. I have to get better no matter what. Are there other tactics you can share with me with regards to my current situation? EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are resources online that perhaps you could look into to help with expressing yourself. EOS 3 0 17 Is there any particular resource you can refer me to? EOS 3 1 18 [Others] Yes just a moment. EOS 3 0 19 Waiting, thank you. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I was going to send you a few links but it wont let me. EOS 3 0 21 Ooh too bad. Could you just name a few then i can look them up on my own later? EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] instead try googling the phrase" how to open up to others" and there should be a few sites with tips and references. EOS 3 0 23 Ok that' s rather helpful. EOS 3 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] healthyplace. com has a good article. EOS 3 0 25 Will definitely check it out. EOS 3 1 26 [Others] Im hope that i have been able to help at least a little bit. EOS 3 0 27 You have been of a very great help to me today. I feel better and ready to face the world. EOS 3 1 28 [Greeting] Excellent! im so happy to hear that, Maybe next time youll be the one to inspire someone! Have a great rest of your day!

Do you have plans for the holidays? EOS 0 1 5 [Others] not really, i will probably just relax. what about you? EOS 0 0 6 Just hanging out at home with my husband and son. EOS 0 1 7 [Others] how' s your relationship with your family? EOS 0 0 8 It is pretty good. We all get along good. No issues. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] glad to hear so! EOS 0 0 10 How is your relationship with your family? EOS 0 1 11 [Others] it' s overly alright but i don' t really get along with my father. EOS 0 0 12 Oh i am sorry to hear that.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] don' t worry, it' s okay i am used to it. EOS 0 0 14 Has the Pandemic affected your work life at all?. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] not really i' ve always worked from home. what about you? EOS 0 0 16 Not me so much. Business was slow for quite a while because nobody was really working. But it affected my husband, because everytime anyone in our house got sick he had to leave work becase his work didnt allow anybody to be there if anybody in there household was sick.. So he missed quite a bit of work. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that must have been really terrible, i hope you all are coping with that. how did that make you feel? EOS 0 0 18 It was nerve wracking because you never knew how long he was going to be out of work for. his work changed their policy about when he could come back everytime he was out. EOS 0 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] just from talking to you i can see that it was very stressing for you. is he back to work yet? EOS 0 0 20 oh yes it defintely was. he is out again because I just tested positive for COVID. So he will be out of work for two weeks. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] is there any possibility of him getting a vaccine? he seems to be testing positive fairly often. EOS 0 0 22 He has never tested positive. I tested positive. Just anytime you get any kind of sickness his work makes you take time off just in case you have COVID. He has been tested 3 different times and it has always been negative. EOS 0 1 23 [Others] oh sorry for misunderstanding you. EOS 0 0 24 Thats okay. EOS 0 1 25 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] correct me if i' m wrong but sickness causes you nervousness? EOS 0 0 26 most things cause me nervousness. i am a very anxious person. not sure why.. EOS 0 1 27 [Self-disclosure] i am nervous at times too and i usually try to take a break and do something i find comfort in when i feel like that. i can' t imagine how siffucult must be for you to feel like this often. i' m sure you will be able to find a way to relief your anxiety. EOS 0 0 28 Yea i try to do that too. Most times its playing a game on my tablet or phone or something. it is very difficult feelling like this all the time.. I am trying to not let things stress me out as much.. EOS 0 1 29 [Providing Suggestions or Information] playing on your tablet seems like a good way to releive your stresss, do you find it effective?

EOS 0 0 3 two exams and two assignments due at the end of this and next month. that' s good. EOS 0 1 4 [Others] Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful. EOS 0 0 5 yeah I have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it' s online and basically I do things on my own time.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you taking a lot of courses? EOS 0 0 7 2 courses. but I am pretty much using full time capacity on them. devoting full - time I mean. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] do you like doing school online better than in person? EOS 0 0 9 Have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good the more time you have to devote the better! EOS 0 0 11 I have done both methods. I definitely prefer in - school studies.. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel it is more stressful online? EOS 0 0 13 I am just disappointed that I have been slacking off and procrastinating. no it' s just that it' s a different avenue. I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. I think it' s because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow.. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hi, I feel really sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am sorry. What is going on? EOS 4 0 3 My friends won' t hang out with me. I am alone all the time.

EOS 4 1 6 [Question] You prefer it that way?.

4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out. EOS 4 0 6 I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night? EOS 4 0 8 I can' t sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it' s typically late afternoon. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds like you are doing the very best you can under difficult circumstances. you should feel very proud about that. EOS 4 0 10 thank you. i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] it sounds to me that your sleep issue is really weighing on your mind. you may be setting yourself up for sleep issues by thinking about this so much. is that possible? EOS 4 0 12 yes it may be. i' m not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you' re under a lot of pressure. it' s only natural that you would feel overwhelmed. dont be hard on yourself. you' re doing the best you can. EOS 4 0 14 thank you. that is very supportive. i just dont know how to make the next ten days go by faster. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can spend some time doing pleasant things. it is true that time seems to go fast when we' re having fun. EOS 4 0 16 that' s true. i thought about maybe playing video games. EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] fantastic! that' s a great way to spend your time. EOS 4 0 18 maybe overwatch. i haven' t been playing them much. EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] i' m wondering: are you a reader? do you enjoy reading? i' m asking because i find when i read a good book, time seems to move very quickly. EOS 4 0 20 i am. but i have a hard time focusing as of late. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can make a goal of reading a few pages and then see if you can build on that. then, if you want, you can make a goal of reading a chapter. EOS 4 0 22 that' s a great idea. that may help a lot with focus. EOS 4 1 23 [Self-disclosure] personally i love reading; especially non fiction. what type of books do you enjoy? EOS 4 0 24 dystopian fantasy style books. and also historical nonfiction. EOS 4 1 25 [Self-disclosure] i enjoy historical non fiction very much. do you have any favorite authors? EOS 4 0 26 lauren destefano. her series the chemical garden trilogy is my favorite. EOS 4 1 27 [Question] has she written anything you haven' t read yet that you think you would enjoy? EOS 4 0 28 that' s also another good idea. i haven' t read all of her bookis. EOS 4 1 29 [Question] do you live near a library? EOS 4 0 30 i do but they' re closed because of covid. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] there may be some libraries in your area that are open, or have reduced hours.
4 0 0 I am so embarassed and saddened. I can not believe he cheated on me. I thought we were going to work out. I was really attracted into him and I cared for him a lot. I wanted to date him longer. Thank Goodness I did not sleep with him. What a disaster. Why are men like this? Why do they break women' s hearts? I wish there were more decent men out there that did not play around. Men can be such pigs! EOS 4 1 1 [Question] what happened?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:) EOS 2 0 7 It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am in the UK. It' s sort of a grey area... police won' t really do anything but you can' t buy it over the counter. EOS 2 0 9 One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I' m very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially. EOS 2 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot. The US seems to be really strict on it tho. EOS 2 0 11 It varies, state by state, depending on which party is governing. Which you of course have a version of in the UK. Mayoral elections were today yeah? EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] They were but I didn' t pay much attention:) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that' s all. EOS 2 0 13 Oh, well, I' m sorry to hear that. I think participation in local governance is actually the most achievable path for change, but perhaps how it' s structured where you are, it wouldn' t really matter much if you participated. I guess mayorals are only technically local, not like parliamentary elections. EOS 2 1 14 [Others] If I were in London or a major city I' d vote for Mayor. I am in a rural area and we don' t have one: D. I vote for local councillors tho. EOS 2 0 15 Oh, I take it to mean that you are anti - Khan? If you feel like you' d need to vote for mayor in London. EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I like Khan:) EOS 2 0 17 Jeremy Corbyn, no surrender? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I like him too lol. EOS 2 0 19 You sound like someone I' d like to smoke a spliff with In a moderated manner of course, in relevance to the topic I opened with. EOS 2 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] But I don' t get to vote for London mayor. Only if I were a London resident or nearby would I( sorry for tortured syntax) EOS 2 0 21 Prescriptive grammar is fascism, use whatever words in whatever order you like. Ironic given that I just watched My Fair Lady the other day. EOS 2 1 22 [Self-disclosure] Haha I don' t indulge these days, except for once in a blue moon: P. EOS 2 0 23 You' ve got those weird drug shops in the UK, with synthetics and all that. EOS 2 1 24 [Self-disclosure] Not where I am:( All we have here is sheep and cows. EOS 2 0 25 Let me guess - north/ eastern UK? EOS 2 1 26 [Self-disclosure] North West but close:) EOS 2 0 27 I have a slightly deeper knowledge of the UK than most Americans. I binged Derry Girls in 2 days so my expertise is almost professorial here. EOS 2 1 28 [Others] haha! I am not touching that one:) EOS 2 0 29 It' s a good series but yeah if you don' t skew younger demographic wise I could see why you' d avoid it. You more of a Last Tango In Halifax type? Don' t even watch the Circle? Only Connect? EOS 2 1 30 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I don' t think Derry people would like being referred to as part of the UK;) EOS 2 0 31 True that. But, you know. Legally. EOS 2 1 32 [Self-disclosure] yeah... heh I don' t go there, being half English and half Irish:). But yeah that was so my era..
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one. EOS 4 0 16 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. What else can I do besides meditation? EOS 4 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds? EOS 4 0 18 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. Candles are much better for me. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil. EOS 4 0 20 I haven' t heard of that website before. I' ll have to check it out. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships. EOS 4 0 22 Well, I haven' t been in a long - term relationship like this before.. My past relationships were all in high school, and they only lasted a few weeks or months at a time. I really cared for this one, and we were together for so long. EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] I feel obligated to help during Christmas because I had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts. EOS 4 0 24 You had a fight with your partner? I' m sorry, it' s the worst when people fight over what' s supposed to be something nice. EOS 4 1 25 [Question] What was the fight over? Food? Money? Sex? EOS 4 0 26 I forget what started it, it was something stupid. He didn' t like the way I said something and it kind of blew up from there. We were fighting over the smallest things these last few months. It just kind of built up to the point where he said he couldn' t take fighting with me anymore and just wanted to end it. EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would let things decompress for a long while. EOS 4 0 28 End the relationship, I mean. You think maybe if we just take some time apart, he might want to talk about it? EOS 4 1 29 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest thinking through ending the relationship if he has a hot temper.. EOS 4 0 30 He does get upset very easily. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, just think it through for some time.. EOS 4 0 32 I do think it is important to take some time and breathe. EOS 4 1 33 [Question] Was the relationship with him pleasant for many months? EOS 4 0 34 Yes, for most of our time together it was wonderful. He made me laugh very easily. That' s part of why I' m so sad that he ended the relationship. EOS 4 1 35 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said it has only gotten rough in the last two months?
2 0 0 hi. EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hey! How are you? EOS 2 0 2 trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once:( EOS 2 1 3 [Question] What are these thoughts?:) EOS 2 0 4 Its so stupid. I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts just come so fast. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while. EOS 2 0 6 tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes I cant controll the thoughts or like I dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing. EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] A chemical thing, so maybe you need a counsellor, and then he can assess your problem, and everything will be alright:) EOS 2 0 8 I have one and it helps sometimes. I try to meditate. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. Does it help you? If it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently. EOS 2 0 10 i pretty much have to do it constantly. EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not constantly. because then you won' t have anytime to do anything else, but if negative thoughts always come into your head, maybe try doing something you enjoy doing. EOS 2 0 12 yeah maybe its as simple as that. I know Im the problem cause its very obvious that im the on ein control of the thoughts for the most part. EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, maybe. But always look at the bright side of stuff and maybe the negative thoughts can stop. EOS 2 0 14 right. I will try and start that more today and commit to it. EOS 2 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes that' s the spirit! And with that mind set good things will always come to you! EOS 2 0 16 yes i agree. when i consistently use meditation and positive attitude, any bad things are defintely minimized. EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, as long as you keep focused and not divert into any other thoughts:) EOS 2 0 18 yes. do you meditate?' EOS 2 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I do it once a week and it really helps. I used to do it more often when I felt I couldn' t do anything right, so always do it according to the situation. EOS 2 0 20 do you want to keep talking or should we wrap up? i could go either way. EOS 2 1 21 [Others] Yes. If you want to. EOS 2 0 22 I might go and have some breakfast. It was great chatting:) EOS 2 1 23 [Others] But im here for you but if we are done lets wrap it up:) yes, byee.
3 0 0 hello. how are you today? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today?. EOS 3 0 2 a bit sad. more depressed. its just i keep getting benched at work. i' m not really sure what do to.* to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset. EOS 3 0 4 i' m not really sure what i' m doing wrong. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though. EOS 3 0 6 what can i do though? EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there' s anything going on? EOS 3 0 8 hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Of course! That sounds frustrating to not know why it' s happening and not have the opportunity to ask. EOS 3 0 10 yes... hrm. that may work. how can i stop being depressed all the time though.. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' ve also had bosses that are infrequently in the office and make getting good information hard. EOS 3 0 12 how did you fix the issue? i work at home and its like just trying to reach out - they are always busy. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren' t always a reflection of us or how we' re performing. EOS 3 0 14 this whole covid thing has me scrambling to talk to a live person. EOS 3 1 15 [Others] I can imagine! EOS 3 0 16 ok, so just keep pushing and getting good work done? EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I was in a physical office when I had this problem, but the boss rotated between offices. It was hard to wait, but I just kept my head down until the next time she was available. That' s what I did. EOS 3 0 18 maybe i can try that. thank you. i' ll give it a shot. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think reminding yourself that if there was a problem with your work they would be seeking YOU out, and not the other way around.
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you doing? EOS 1 0 1 Hi, I' m ok. How are you? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] Not bad, it' s a peaceful night. Anything in particular you' d like to talk about?
3 0 0 hi there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! what seems to be bothering you today? EOS 3 0 2 currently, i am living in a house with my brother, which i co own and can not afford to move out.. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Is living with your brother a bad thing? What specifically is making you upset? EOS 3 0 4 yes it is. he acts like a azz most of the time. he dosent care about anyone but himself. just like his fiancé. he throws away the bills and expects me to pay to keep the utilities on when they are about to be disconnected. then tells me i dont contribute to the house.. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems like he would be a very difficult person to live with. And that is hard for you obviously. I' m thinking your upset because you can' t leave so you' re stuck. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 6 yes, felling very stuck.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s completely normal to feel that way. I' m sure you' re handling the situation as best as you can. What have you done to try and help the situation? EOS 3 0 8 trying to, looking for every way possible to make money and save it up and move out. really dont want to have to partition the property as its the house we grew up in.. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I would feel the same way if that' s a house I grew up in. I' m so sorry! EOS 3 0 10 i tried to talk to him, in his mind its all my fault he cant pay the bills he had before i moved in. i had been living in california for the last few years, but came back with corona virus on the rise there.. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If he' s in a certain mindset, it would be hard to change that. Do you have people to talk to about this? It sounds like a lot to handle. EOS 3 0 12 right? and his fiancé is the same way, they are both alcoholics and spend most of their income on their habits. its all i can do right now to keep food in the house, let alone running water.. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think it would be good for you to talk to someone and get help. Right now, all you can do is keep chugging along and trying your best to stay afloat. EOS 3 0 14 i have a couple of friends that i have talked to about it, but it just seems like i am screaming at a brick wall and nothing changes.. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest talking to a therapist if your insurance can handle that! Talking with them can help you figure out what you should do. EOS 3 0 16 honestly, i think its him that needs the therapist. he is clearly bi polar like my father was, and dosent want to admit to it. several people have tried to talk to him about it but he just denies it and goes to the other room. i know what a the therapist will tell me, that i need to either resolve the conflict or try and move out, hard to do with the epidemic going on and a lack of funds to do it.. is it normal to always feel helpless? cause thats how its been. either rip everything to shreds or do nothing.. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] Yes it is. Especially now. I just want to encourage to keep pushing. Think about yourself in a year or two from now. Do everything you can right now to get out of the situation. If it gets really bad, don' t be afraid to call out for help( like the police). Stay safe and do what' s best for you. You' ve got this! EOS 3 0 18 police are a very bad idea where i live. they will not prosecute family violence without also prosecuting me. i live in texas, if i press charges, the state will press charges against me. i have several scars from incidents where they told me as such. its really a loosing battle where the law is concerned here.. EOS 3 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] oh wow that' s terrible. that must be so stressful for you. EOS 3 0 20 thank you for listening tho. it is nice to talk to someone outside of my normal circle about these things.:) EOS 3 1 21 [Greeting] yes of course! I hope everything works out in the end. You' ll be in my thoughts:) EOS 3 0 22 thank you. i apprecieate it.. EOS 3 1 23 [Others] Please remember to end the conversation.
3 0 0 hello. how are you today? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today?. EOS 3 0 2 a bit sad. more depressed. its just i keep getting benched at work. i' m not really sure what do to.* to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset.
4 0 0 i cant go back to uni due to finacial issue. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Good afternoon. How may I assist you?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello there! How can I help you this afternoon?. EOS 3 0 1 I' m just feeling really down lately and would like to talk to someone who understands. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Feeling consistently sad is a tough place to be. I' m sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 3 0 3 Thank you. I think since the pandemic it' s gotten worse. It' s hard to find the" reason" to go about my day. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand that. Are you working or attending classes from home?. EOS 3 0 5 I graduated in the spring but haven' t been able to find a job because of what' s going on, so that' s been tough. My wife works from home though. What about you? EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It' s very hard to maintain a sense of consistency when we have few boundaries on our time, or a daily routine..
5 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling today? EOS 5 0 1 uninspired. broken. a rock. a static object. bananas. EOS 5 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, that' s a start. Do I hear you saying that you' re confused at the moment? EOS 5 0 3 not confused. frustrated that I have to produce art for marks when I am not inspired. EOS 5 1 4 [Question] Ah I hear you, education can be both wonderful and difficult can' t it? What are you supposed to produce? EOS 5 0 5 painting after painting. like I am an ikea machine, photocopying picasos for A' s. EOS 5 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that that is very frustrating. Would you consider switching majors? EOS 5 0 7 What is life but a stage. Art is life. I love art.. no. EOS 5 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass. Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of your future and one day it will pay off? EOS 5 0 9 does the sun now set and then rise again. Does the spring not come after winter. Yet I cannot see how art will give me grades. EOS 5 1 10 [Question] Well, I am assuming that you want to go into an artistic field on graduation? EOS 5 0 11 yes, but no like a 9 - 5 job. perhaps i am yet another art failure. art has no time. EOS 5 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you are putting yourself down unnecessarily. Many people do make a lucrative career from an art qualification. I would urge you to keep working to the best of your ability and see what happens. EOS 5 0 13 you speak the truth. I will again pick up my brush and see where my inspiration takes me. oh it has been a joy talking to you. EOS 5 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you ever tried searching for information about careers in your field? We still have a few minutes left:) There are a lot of different ways in which you can use an art degree! EOS 5 0 15 Yes. we do. I will call my newest work the brilliant support of mturk! pls give me more inspriation. EOS 5 1 16 [Others] That sounds like a definite winner:) I see a Turner prize beckoning in your future. EOS 5 0 17 wow. Turner. are you in the UK? is the UK. EOS 5 1 18 [Others] Yes I am, where are you? EOS 5 0 19 USA. EOS 5 1 20 [Others] Ah.. well hopefully things will pick up for you next year. Well it' s been lovely talking, I wish you all the best! EOS 5 0 21 The quest for the Turner starts now. goods travels to you chap! EOS 5 1 22 [Others] and you!
0 1 0 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hello, How are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 am fine. at least for now. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] would you like to talk about it? EOS 0 0 3 yeah... i have not been able to meet with my boyfriend physically due to the corona lockdown, and when i finally got to see him last month i discovered that he is cheating on me. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am so sorry that you had to go through that, I know this is a very difficult time for you. Has your boyfriend reached out to you at all to clarify things or to see if you are okay? EOS 0 0 5 he has but it is not sounding convincing enough. i feel so hurt. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Just By chatting with you, I can feel how hurt and upset you are. Is there anyone that can provide you support at home during this time? EOS 0 0 7 there is nobody i can talk to about this, i dont really have friends and my siblings are busy with their lives. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] This is a very challenging time for you especially when there is lack of support. I do feel your pain, And I would like to share some advise and suggestions which may alleviate some of the hurt and pain you are going through. Would you e open to hear them out? EOS 0 0 9 sure, thanks for this. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Mindfulness and yoga have proven to help overcome feelings of low mood and perhaps you could try with taking a few deep breaths and listening to some calming music before going to bed tonight. Do you think that, you can try something like this? EOS 0 0 11 yoga sounds interesting but i will try starting it by weekend. some calming music will do at the moment. any suggestions for me? EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am so proud of you for giving this a try. I would like to suggest OCB relaxing music, which will help you relax. EOS 0 0 13 thanks so much for this, i feel a weight lifted off my mind. EOS 0 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] I am so glad that you are feeling better. Just rest assured that I will be here for you should you need to talk to some one and I will do my best to support and guide you.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 Hi, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Greeting] Doing good.. How are you? EOS 0 0 3 I' m feeling really anxious these days. I' m finding the COVID online learning experience to be too much for me at this time. I want to stop school, but I don' t think I can afford to. I need to get done with school. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand your frustration. All of us are challenged due to COVID. EOS 0 0 5 School was always hard. Now it' s gotten harder. I think a lot of people are stressed.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] How long are you doing the online school? EOS 0 0 7 Last semester and this semester. It feels like a lot longer though. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What are you missing most? Friends? EOS 0 0 9 A balance in life. I spend so much time online. I' m always staring at a screen. I would like to get aware from the computer. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] As the vaccination started, I believe we will be back to normal soon.. EOS 0 0 11 Yeah, I can' t wait for things to return to normal. Until then, I don' t know what I can do to feel normal. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I saw some of my friends hang out in zoom... having virtual drinks.. have you tried that? EOS 0 0 13 No, I haven' t. I thought it wouldn' t be the same as really hanging out. I don' t drink. I do like to play board games though. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It will not be same.. but better than being alone.. EOS 0 0 15 That' s true. I wanted to play board games online with some friends, but they weren' t interested. It' s not the same thing to play with strangers. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I have a group with my elementary school friends.. we hang out in zoom because we all are spread out across the globe.. some times.. it; s fun as we can share a lot of memories.. EOS 0 0 17 That' s great. I wish I had kept in touch with my friends from those days. I' m not really much for just socializing though. I like some kind of activity, like games. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Got you.. try to form a group on - line with the people you know.. at least until this CONVID thing is over.. EOS 0 0 19 Ok. Not really sure how to form a group. I want to reach out, but so many people are flaky. They makes plans then bail at the last minute.. EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] For sure you would find someone.. if you keep looking..
0 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I am good, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m doing well, but it could have been better. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] What seems to be bothering you tonight? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, my boy friend of 3 years has refused to take our relationship to the next level and I' m kind of getting tired, I don' t want to play games anymore. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don' t feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,. EOS 0 0 6 exactly, I hate to feel that I' m wasting my time. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand that, as I was in a long term relationship and I felt as though my girlfriend at the time did not want to take things to the next step and I was not happy about it.. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I love him so dearly to want to settle down with him, but if he doesn' t want that for me I would rather call it quits now than continue and be disappointed at the long run.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you had that conversation with him? I know it might be a difficult conversation to have, but it is often good to get expectations out in the open so you are on the same page with your partner.. EOS 0 0 10 Yes, sort of and he gave me the impression that he is not there yet and that was a like almost a year ago, I don' t want it to look like I' m pushing him if I try to talk to him again about it. His nonchalant attitude in not seeing the seriousness of it is killing me, I' m just not happy. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] That is tough, but sometimes people just portray things differently, for instance I am also very laid back and nonchalant about most things which can lead to miscommunications.. I don' t think it would be pushing if you haven' t had that conversation in almost a year. EOS 0 0 12 I hope you are right, just don' t want to come across as a desperate person and that' s why I' m setting myself up to call it quits if he tries to sound like he sounded the last time. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You need to know where he is so you can make a good decision for yourself! I know it is difficult, but I know you can get through it!
0 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hai. EOS 0 0 1 Hey. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How are you friend? Where are you from?
1 0 0 I am so mad that I can' t see straight. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello! What is on your mind today? Oh really? Why is that? EOS 1 0 2 Well, my boyfriend has cheated so many times that I cant count them. I then meet someone nice and cheat on him once and now he breaks up with me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] being mad that your boyfriend cheated is normal. being mad when dumped is normal. don' t you think you DESERVE better than he was treating you? EOS 1 0 4 Thank you! I can see that I am talking to someone who understands. I am wondering if I should beg him back?? I really do love him. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there too. Expecially with covid, it can be hard realiing you may be alone and it may be frusterating dating someone new. if you really love someone, shouldnt they love you back? did his actions show love? EOS 1 0 6 Yeah, and we have been together since high school so it is really hard to think of ever marrying anyone else. He asked me to marry him but we never made it official or got rings. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak. i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart. EOS 1 0 8 He told me he never wants kids with me but acts like he would have them someday, somehow? I think you' re right. EOS 1 1 9 [Self-disclosure] i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter. trust me, its not worth it in the long run. maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you! EOS 1 0 10 Noway! That is my worst nightmare, I am so sorry. That is a real eye opener for me/ That is exactly what I don' t think I could handle. I just am in the worst cycle ever and don' t have any friends to turn to or anybody who wants to listen to the drama. I think I have wasted a lot of my life and I can' t ever get the time back that I have invested in him. EOS 1 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i think a lot of couples are feeling stuck with covid. once things open up and everyone is vaccinated and get togethers happen again, i bet there will be a LOT more breakups and a lot more options out there! all we can do is learn from our mistakes and not let the past repeat itself.
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 2 I have been better. I had a rough semester in school.. EOS 6 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So things haven' t been going well at school. I think a lot of people are going through these days. EOS 6 0 4 It was alright at first but I failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade. EOS 6 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m sorry to hear that. That' s a heck of a situation to be in. Is there anything you can do? Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock? EOS 6 0 6 Yes, I already tried to appeal my grade. EOS 6 1 7 [Question] And the teacher wouldn' t budge?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today. EOS 3 0 2 I feel bad putting this on your shoulders, maybe you can help. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] i have big shoulders! whats on your mind? EOS 3 0 4 I' m just struggling a lot to find the motivation to do anything at all, even the most basic of things. Sometimes I get very intense feelings of sadness and just want to drop everything I' m doing, like I can' t do anything more. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] i think a lot of people are feeling that way these past few months. do you think it is covid related? not sickness, more depression. EOS 3 0 6 Yes that' s very true, depression is probably hitting people the worst right now. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] its becoming a new normal lol. EOS 3 0 8 No I' ve been fighting depression since I was probably like 12 years old, it first really hit me when I moved from where I was living all my life and lost all my friends and I was terrified. Now I' m 29. But covid definitely plays a factor. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] a few months ago i was feeling the same way. i dont have health insurance but googled and found some online docturs. i got to see a doc and get on antidepressants for less than a hundred. covid plays a factor in EVERYTHING ugh. EOS 3 0 10 So you had the therapy session online with them via webcam or you found them online first then went to see them in person. Yeah covid is doing damage in more ways than one. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] all online!:) meds shipped to my door. i love it! EOS 3 0 12 Wow that' s great. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] theres a free site called 7 cups that does free peer to peer couseling too. its good when i have a lot on my mind. EOS 3 0 14 I would have to do it in person, I don' t want people I live with to hear about all my pathetic mental problems. Oh 7 cups, I had an account there and met a really nice girl there that was helping me and she was living with an abusive family at the same time, its crazy but now I can' t access that account anymore, I' m so sad about that. I think it says the account doesn' t exist when I try to login now. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] can you make a new one?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that? EOS 0 0 21 being on the board gives me perks. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit? EOS 0 0 23 yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there' s an element of mutual manipulation. EOS 0 0 25 yes. EOS 0 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are definitely not the only person to feel this way! EOS 0 0 27 it' s a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power.. what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board. EOS 0 0 29 i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment. EOS 0 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] But that is rather manipulative of you. EOS 0 0 31 if you were me you would forget about him and the board. EOS 0 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I definitely would do that. EOS 0 0 33 thing is he is encouraging me to be like that. cuz it helps him too. okay. i' ll try to lay low and walk away from it. EOS 0 1 34 [Others] I think it' s time for a clear severance. Do you have any other people you are interested in? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 35 yes but it' s less than before cuz of Covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this - if that makes sense. EOS 0 1 36 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah I hear you. You feel that your options are rather more limited than previously because of the lockdown?
0 0 0 hi there. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m surviving. Today is better than yesterday was. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. What is bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I' ve been out of work since Covid closed down the live event industry in March. the unemployment system still hasn' t processed any of my claims, and I have been surviving off of what I can make driving for doordash, which hasn' t been a lot. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough. The unemployment system has been very slow during COVID, so I completely understand your frustration and worry. I am glad to hear that you are doing door dash, even if you aren' t making a lot that is still something! EOS 0 0 6 ugh, yeah... I drive a really old beat up car though, so I can' t really go out after dark, and I' m worried I' m driving it too much and it' s going to break down. I wish mturk paid more, or one of the jobs I' ve applied for would hire me to do something form home. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I also wish mturk paid more, I feel like it takes a lot of time for not that much money. Do you have a roommate, friend, or family member' s car you could possibly borrow instead of using your own? EOS 0 0 8 No, I live with housemates but they all don' t drive. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. Are you still looking for and applying for jobs?
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 3 0 2 Not feeling good. Trying to find a job but no success. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] It' s a really hard time to be finding new work isn' t it? Are you getting unemployment or anything? EOS 3 0 4 I am getting unemployment but that is not sufficient with 6 children. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wow that' s a lot of kids. Do you know that there are foodbanks out there which might be able to help you? EOS 3 0 6 As a single mother It' s pretty hard to go to search for food bank. I am spending most of my time in looking for a job. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are there any organisations that you could just call and explain your predicament to? EOS 3 0 8 I don' t know any as I never faced such situation before and my partner was there to support the family. Now there is no support of him. life is becoming misearable. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Do you have friends who could help you, even with child care?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:) EOS 2 0 7 It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am in the UK. It' s sort of a grey area... police won' t really do anything but you can' t buy it over the counter. EOS 2 0 9 One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I' m very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially. EOS 2 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot. The US seems to be really strict on it tho. EOS 2 0 11 It varies, state by state, depending on which party is governing. Which you of course have a version of in the UK. Mayoral elections were today yeah? EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] They were but I didn' t pay much attention:) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that' s all. EOS 2 0 13 Oh, well, I' m sorry to hear that. I think participation in local governance is actually the most achievable path for change, but perhaps how it' s structured where you are, it wouldn' t really matter much if you participated. I guess mayorals are only technically local, not like parliamentary elections. EOS 2 1 14 [Others] If I were in London or a major city I' d vote for Mayor. I am in a rural area and we don' t have one: D. I vote for local councillors tho. EOS 2 0 15 Oh, I take it to mean that you are anti - Khan? If you feel like you' d need to vote for mayor in London. EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I like Khan:) EOS 2 0 17 Jeremy Corbyn, no surrender? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I like him too lol. EOS 2 0 19 You sound like someone I' d like to smoke a spliff with In a moderated manner of course, in relevance to the topic I opened with. EOS 2 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] But I don' t get to vote for London mayor. Only if I were a London resident or nearby would I( sorry for tortured syntax) EOS 2 0 21 Prescriptive grammar is fascism, use whatever words in whatever order you like. Ironic given that I just watched My Fair Lady the other day. EOS 2 1 22 [Self-disclosure] Haha I don' t indulge these days, except for once in a blue moon: P. EOS 2 0 23 You' ve got those weird drug shops in the UK, with synthetics and all that. EOS 2 1 24 [Self-disclosure] Not where I am:( All we have here is sheep and cows. EOS 2 0 25 Let me guess - north/ eastern UK? EOS 2 1 26 [Self-disclosure] North West but close:) EOS 2 0 27 I have a slightly deeper knowledge of the UK than most Americans. I binged Derry Girls in 2 days so my expertise is almost professorial here. EOS 2 1 28 [Others] haha! I am not touching that one:)

3 1 0 [Question] Good afternoon how may I help you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello there. I' m suffering with increased depression and I' m not quite clear why. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately? EOS 3 0 3 No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that' s the same for everyone. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression? EOS 3 0 5 I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I' ve always had a low mood but now I' m anxious that it will continue to get worse. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again? EOS 3 0 7 Since lockdown haven' t spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don' t want this to get any worse. What if she isn' t available?. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It wouldn' t hurt to try and reach out. If she isn' t available, there are other services. EOS 3 0 9 What like support groups etc? I' m also sure this isn' t just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It' s weird and a little concerning to be honest. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app. EOS 3 0 11 I hadn' t thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it' s worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn' t available. Sometimes its good to have options. EOS 3 0 13 I' ll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues?. EOS 3 1 14 [Self-disclosure] After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety. It wasn' t until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it. EOS 3 0 15 That must have been difficult to deal with. Mental health affects so many people in so many ways. It' s good that it' s recognised these days at least. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] It was. Luckily I had my doctor to help me. Family members meant well but chalked it up to" that' s what its like to be a mom" but it is more than that.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello.:) How are you? EOS 0 0 1 I am okay. A little anxious I am feeling helpless. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am sorry to hear that. What are you feeling helpless about? EOS 0 0 3 I am worried about upcoming bills. I lost my job. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I see. I would be worried about that as well. How long have you been out of work? EOS 0 0 5 About 2 weeks. Christmas is right around the corner. I dont know how I am going to get the kids presents. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anyone you are able to ask for support right now, like your parents? I am sure they would understand, since so many people have been losing jobs lately. EOS 0 0 7 I don' t have a lot if family.. I have my sister who lives far away. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I see. And your kids are depending on you to be able to take care of them. I am so sorry; I know that must be extremely stressful. Are you married right now? If so, does your spouse have a job? EOS 0 0 9 Yes, my kids are older, yes I am married and he is working. He isnt easy to talk to.. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] I see. Do you mean that you are not on good terms with him? EOS 0 0 11 Its off and on. Some days are better than others.. I think its just the weather. Its cold. Gloomy that doesn' t help either. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I can understand that. It' s been cold and gloomy over here and my whole family has been in a bad mood. It seems like a little thing, but I find that taking Vitamin D supplements when the weather is bad helps me not to get depressed.
3 0 0 hello. how are you today? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today?. EOS 3 0 2 a bit sad. more depressed. its just i keep getting benched at work. i' m not really sure what do to.* to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset. EOS 3 0 4 i' m not really sure what i' m doing wrong. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though. EOS 3 0 6 what can i do though? EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there' s anything going on?
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing. EOS 6 0 8 Yeah, people don' t know that just because my two friends go" Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two( so - called) friends? EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] definatly not... have you tried explaining your situation to them? EOS 6 0 10 No, they don' t know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID - 19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time? EOS 6 0 12 I might be able to do that. EOS 6 1 13 [Others] unfortunatly it is right now very comen this situation, so no shame for that,
0 1 0 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hello, How are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 am fine. at least for now. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] would you like to talk about it? EOS 0 0 3 yeah... i have not been able to meet with my boyfriend physically due to the corona lockdown, and when i finally got to see him last month i discovered that he is cheating on me. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am so sorry that you had to go through that, I know this is a very difficult time for you. Has your boyfriend reached out to you at all to clarify things or to see if you are okay? EOS 0 0 5 he has but it is not sounding convincing enough. i feel so hurt. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Just By chatting with you, I can feel how hurt and upset you are. Is there anyone that can provide you support at home during this time? EOS 0 0 7 there is nobody i can talk to about this, i dont really have friends and my siblings are busy with their lives. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] This is a very challenging time for you especially when there is lack of support. I do feel your pain, And I would like to share some advise and suggestions which may alleviate some of the hurt and pain you are going through. Would you e open to hear them out? EOS 0 0 9 sure, thanks for this. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Mindfulness and yoga have proven to help overcome feelings of low mood and perhaps you could try with taking a few deep breaths and listening to some calming music before going to bed tonight. Do you think that, you can try something like this? EOS 0 0 11 yoga sounds interesting but i will try starting it by weekend. some calming music will do at the moment. any suggestions for me? EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am so proud of you for giving this a try. I would like to suggest OCB relaxing music, which will help you relax. EOS 0 0 13 thanks so much for this, i feel a weight lifted off my mind. EOS 0 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] I am so glad that you are feeling better. Just rest assured that I will be here for you should you need to talk to some one and I will do my best to support and guide you. EOS 0 0 15 thank you for calming words. EOS 0 1 16 [Others] Have a great day. EOS 0 0 17 sure, you too. EOS 0 1 18 [Greeting] thank you.
3 0 0 I am feeling depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about your feelings? EOS 3 0 2 I feel lost and lonely, i do not know what to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] When did these feelings come about.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? I' d love to chat with you! What' s been on your mind? EOS 3 0 1 oh hello. I' m having problems with friends - or more precisely the lack of them. I don' t have any. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see. You feel as though you don' t have any friend' s currently? I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It' s so hard to see people and keep relationships right now. EOS 3 0 3 Well it' s more that I think I' ve never had friends. Not anyone I can confide in or laugh with. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a really hard thing to be going through. I' m sorry to hear that. Do you have any really close family members that you are able to confide in? EOS 3 0 5 I don' t think I' d want to let them know how unhappy I am to be honest. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Oh I see. Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn' t have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out! IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it' s 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do. I actually found a couple close friends through apps like that. Have you heard about those or looked into them? EOS 3 0 7 I' ve never heard of friendship apps to be honest. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah! They are a really good way to connect with people that you share a lot of similar interests with.. But it sounds to me that you are pretty overall sad right now. You don' t want family to know about how sad you are. Do you think it' s more than just feeling like you don' t have any friends? EOS 3 0 9 I' d really like someone local though, someone who I could meet up with face to face and who knew my town. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] On most of the apps, it connects you with people in your town! people close by.
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave? EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad. EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more. I feel that everyone must know that I' ve been dumped and be laughing at me. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time. EOS 1 0 10 I did not really have any choice though. I do not see any future for myself now that we are separated. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] do you know brene brown and her work. EOS 1 0 12 No I do not, who is that? EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her TED talk and there' s a great youtube video on empathy. EOS 1 0 14 Thank you, I will. Right now I really need some sort of emotional support. I feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i bring her up because what i sounds like is that you are feeling embarrassed because your partner made a choice that wasn' t you. in reality the choice they made wasn' t about you, it was about them.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello, how may i help you today? EOS 2 0 1 hi. I am not sure I offended my close friend, I' m scared, he will see pictures of the car I bought for my wife today on my status. actually, I have initial plan to get the a as a birthday gift for my wife before he came to ask for the money. EOS 2 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so you are scared your friend will get mad at you for buying your wife a car after he came asking for money from you? is that correct? EOS 2 0 3 I don' t know how to explain the matter, why I can' t borrow him the money. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] Have you talked to him recently? EOS 2 0 5 yes, you are on l ine with me. yes. EOS 2 1 6 [Question] Has he said anything about the car? EOS 2 0 7 no, he saw the post of the car on my status, but he did' nt say anything. EOS 2 1 8 [Question] do you think he is mad at you? EOS 2 0 9 yes, naturally he will congratulate me as he viewed the pictures. EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i know this can be a tough situation but I believe this situation will pass and everything will be ok between you to. do not let this stress you out or worry that he is mad everything will be ok. i would suggest asking him if he saw your post about the car and ask him if he is mad about it. EOS 2 0 11 ok. can I face him, to ask such question. EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you are comfortable enough facing him then ask him. Just do not force yourself if you are not comfortable doing that. EOS 2 0 13 may be I should tell one of our friends that I think he is mad at me. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if you are more comfortable texting him then i would suggest doing that but i would not just say nothing about you buying the car you should just let him know. EOS 2 0 15 so, we can both settle the matter, I did not have enough money to borrow him at that time because of my initial plan for my wife. ok. thanks for your time. EOS 2 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] I know how you are feeling about that. EOS 2 0 17 yes. EOS 2 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] just try one of my suggestions and see what the result will be. i am really sure the situation will be solved. EOS 2 0 19 okay. EOS 2 1 20 [Greeting] i hope i helped you today. EOS 2 0 21 yes, by God' s grace, I TRUST HOLY SPIRIT HE WILL HELP ME, bye. EOS 2 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes he will.
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you? EOS 1 0 2 Not so good. How are you doing? EOS 1 1 3 [Question] I am doing okay thank you for asking! would you like to talk about whats wrong? EOS 1 0 4 Yes. Well today I had a delivery order. So I went to McDonald' s and pick up the order and took it to the right address and after a few hours I notice that the client did not confirm the order. EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am not knowledgeable in this service industry. Let me understand. You delivered the order, but the customer did not confirm they wanted it.. EOS 1 0 6 Five minutes later my supervisor called me saying that the client call and reported that he did not received his order. And that' s not true at all, I gave him the food. So now i don' t know if they going to fired me or let me keep the job. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation? EOS 1 0 8 Of course I did. He told me he going to give me the benefit of the doubt but that is not enough. Im an honest person and this kind of accusation makes me feel very bad. EOS 1 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I understand, but do not feel bad about yourself. You did your work honestly and delivered the food to your customer. Can I suggest something moving forward?.
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Greeting] hi there. How are you? EOS 1 0 2 I am so frustrated. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] May I ask why you are feeling frustrated? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, my school was closed without warning because of COVID. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand how that could make you so frustrated, that would make me frustrated too. I am waiting to hear about my school. EOS 1 0 6 Yes I don' t even know what is going to happen with finals now. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure that whatever happens, you will do well with them. Have you thought about talking to an administrator at your school? EOS 1 0 8 I hope so. But I feel like this could have been handled better. Not yet, there is a waiting list to talk to an academic advisor. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is all the more reason to be frustrated, i commend you for having to deal with that!
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with this evening?. EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very depressed lately. Like a constant pressure that i don' t know exactly what it is. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I' m very sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 4 0 3 I think the days getting shorter makes it worse. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating. EOS 4 0 5 Do you have any tips on how to overcome it? EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help. I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through Instagram. I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while..
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am very sorry to hear that. What are you sad about? EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently? EOS 4 0 5 It is over permanently... EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah I guess, the relationship was a little toxic and she sometimes only used me for money. Maybe is it for the best now that I think about it. EOS 4 1 8 [Others] Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!! EOS 4 0 9 Yeah I just miss having someone there for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] All you need now is to give yourself some TLC.. treat yourself to something nice and go easy on yourself. EOS 4 0 11 What is TLC. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] There will be someone else. I never thought I' d find anyone else but I did and we' ve been together ten years ago now! Tender Loving Care:) Means be good to yourself. EOS 4 0 13 Ok yeah your story is very inspirational to me. Maybe this was needed in order to find the right person. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anything you can do to distract yourself right now? Plan a holiday or take a night class or something? EOS 4 0 15 I am now doing mturk to get my mind off of it to make some extra money. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Save up what you make and buy yourself something nice? EOS 4 0 17 yeah the only problem is I am barely getting any money from this. Do you have any tips onto how I can make more money/ EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There is some very lucrative stuff out there:). Take what we are doing right now for instance. EOS 4 0 19 I mean 15 minutes for 2$ doesn' t seem very lucrative. but I guess it ads up. EOS 4 1 20 [Question] beats flipping burgers;). So, what are you going to do to get yourself back onto the dating market? EOS 4 0 21 I am going to wait for this whole covid thing to end and then get a real job and once I fix my financial situation I will start dating again. EOS 4 1 22 [Others] Ah yes, the world feels like it' s on hold at the moment doesn' t it? Probably not a good time to start sharing germs with new people: D. EOS 4 0 23 Yeah exactly and I have more pressing matters at hand than a girlfriend because like I said, I am in need of money right now since. EOS 4 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' ll be around for ages if you want to talk some more on here! EOS 4 0 25 I think talking to you has benefited me a lot so thank you for that. I am feeling happy right now. EOS 4 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You' re welcome:) I have a solution for every problem you know;) EOS 4 0 27 Yeah thats what it seems like. how can I make sure you get the most money from this. EOS 4 1 28 [Providing Suggestions or Information] just wait till fifteen mins is up;). If we quit before then we get less. So, um, tell me about your ex? EOS 4 0 29 ok got it. I met my ex through tinder. and then we started going on dates and we both seemed to like each other. EOS 4 1 30 [Self-disclosure] ah! I met mine through OKCUPID. Online dating is definitely the way to go these days. EOS 4 0 31 yeah it really makes it easy to meet new people. EOS 4 1 32 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not like when I was younger when the internet was just taking off. Internet dating was seen as weird then. Well it' s been lovely talking, I hope to see you again sometime:) take care!
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 hi. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How are you? EOS 0 0 3 Ive been better. Stressful day. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Ohh.. sorry to hear that. Would you mind sharing what is going on? EOS 0 0 5 Long story short, im a recovering alcoholic, 52 days sober, however my mental health has hit me with vengeance and am really struggling day to day. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You are getting out of alcoholism and feeling bad about it emotionally, is that right? EOS 0 0 7 i used alcohol as a self medication. It helped keep bad symtoms of ADHD away. I miss what alcohol used to do for me. EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I understand you pain and frustration. I have very close friend who has ADHD and trying to cope with it. EOS 0 0 9 Thankyou for allowing me some of your time. I would be so much better if my heart wasnt poorly. I could then be medicated properly. As of now i just have to live with it. Kinda sucks. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Are you seeing any counselor to address your challenge? EOS 0 0 11 I feel for your friend. EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you.. you know you are not alone in such journey... EOS 0 0 13 yes i have a therapist and currently on a 10 week post detox intensive plan to keep me focused. I have a good support network. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest you keep close touch with the support group and the therapist.. I see you are already in the right path.. EOS 0 0 15 I just wish to live outside my own sideways mind for 5 minutes. I need help with not becoming frustrated and angry with myself. Cant really see a way forward, am i destined to be absent minded for life? i know there must be a way somewhere to live normally. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] As you are already engaged with the professionals to help you.. I bet you will get the necessary help. Keep pursing these engagements... EOS 0 0 17 i will, i will not stop engaging for many years. EOS 0 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see you have the right attitude.. I strongly believe that you will be successful.
1 0 0 Hi. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello though, how has life been treating you lately? EOS 1 0 2 It' s been a pretty crazy year. I' m mostly bummed because of my work. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It has been a really weird year hasn' t it? Don' t worry, I think it' s been the same for all of us. Would you like to tell me more details? EOS 1 0 4 Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else' s pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss( the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That really sucks! I can understand why you are angry and anxious about this and you have every right to be!. Are there any official routes that you can use to complain? EOS 1 0 6 I work in supply chain and I see the actual sales numbers and realized 4 months ago that we were actually on track to exceed our plans, even with the covid reductions. a few weeks later I heard him tell our sales director to keep the numbers artificially low so that they will both get their bonuses. I don' t think so... He' s the VP there isn' t anyone I can go to above him. EOS 1 1 7 [Others] That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint?. It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this. EOS 1 0 8 I don' t know if it is or not... I used my EAP benefit through work where you can talk to a councilor for free( 5 visits) and they said that it' s unfortunate but they didn' t think it was illegal. EOS 1 1 9 [Others] I am very sorry to hear that, that sounds extremely unfair to me. Have you considered looking for another job? I realise it' s a very difficult time to be looking for work right now though. EOS 1 0 10 yeah, it' s tough.. I don' t know if anyone is hiring. because of the timing like you mentioned. I' ve looked a little bit though. EOS 1 1 11 [Others] I really can' t wait for this year to be over! It' s been so awful. Do you suppose anyone at all has had a good year? EOS 1 0 12 haha I don' t know... I' m sure someone has... heck the VP is getting a Bonus... so I' m sure he' d say he' s having a good year. EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well yes fair point! Us poorer people are not doing very well though! Have you tried to talk with any of your coworkers about this? I would suggest that it might help. EOS 1 0 14 Amen.. That' s a good call, I' ve got a work buddy who I feel somewhat comfortable talking with. I may try and reach out to him. EOS 1 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really think you should. You have a legitimate grievance and being able to discuss it with people who understand might help a lot. EOS 1 0 16 I feel a little guilty about sharing what I know because I almost feel like ignorance is bliss at this point. But then I feel guilty for keeping that info. EOS 1 1 17 [Others] I feel that people have the right to know what is being done and will be happy you told them.
4 0 0 I just lost my job and am worried about paying the bills. EOS 4 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills. EOS 4 0 2 There is just too much pressure, but I have to succeed. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is hard having so much pressure but I think you will be able to soon get employed again. EOS 4 0 4 I am trying. I' ve started looking online for new positions but it is a process. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise. EOS 4 0 6 I just still am continually nervous and having a hard time coping. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes deep breaths help people calm down. Have you tried that at all? EOS 4 0 8 I haven' t but maybe that will help me stay calmer. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That can sometimes help you to regain your focus and be able to do more for yourself. EOS 4 0 10 That makes sense. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Also, job counselors may help at employment agencies to match you with potential employers. Have you tried any? EOS 4 0 12 I haven' t but that may be helpful as well. EOS 4 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I sought out help from a recruiter online who helped me to find a job as well. Have you heard of that option or tried it? EOS 4 0 14 That might help me to take the stress off myself and get someone to help in the search. EOS 4 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I see that you seemed to be more relieved finding out these options. Would you say these suggestions have been helpful? EOS 4 0 16 Yes, I' m starting to feel some of the pressure taken off me. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] From what I' ve seen, people who can use some of these strategies like deep breathing and counseling they have felt some relief and could move forward better toward their goals.
4 0 0 hi, how are you? My friend, My best friend, has a new friend and hardly has time for me anymore, we have been friend for over ten years. this hurts. EOS 4 1 1 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before. EOS 4 0 2 its so annoying and hurtful. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Yeah i can tell you something you might not want to hear but it ended with us ending our friendship on that level. EOS 4 0 4 i definitely do not want to end our friendship, that would be even more painful. EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years. We still hang out but it isnt like it was before. People move on to others and it hurts. They usually are not trying to hurt us though. EOS 4 0 6 I know, but its hard when you are the one still stuck, Im not ready for change. EOS 4 1 7 [Others] Yea it was hard for me too. Thats the thing about change it just happens. I would do something focusing on yourself. Trying to make yourself feel better. EOS 4 0 8 i could try to focus on myself. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everyone needs to and everyone forgets too heh. EOS 4 0 10 I agree, i need to focus more on myself. EOS 4 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Good, im glad you can realize that! Some people cant. EOS 4 0 12 its hard to but I know that its time to focus on me more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Great, any ideas on what you would like to focus on? EOS 4 0 14 focus on me, doing things by myself instead of with my friend. going to eat, spa time, me time, only with me. then allow myself to make new friends. do you have any suggestions that i can focus on. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Those are great ideas actually, When i want some me time, i usually go for a nice long hike or run.
2 1 0 [Question] hi! how are you doing today> EOS 2 0 1 Hello, I' m doing okay, wbu? EOS 2 1 2 [Others] ok it' s been a stressful time for most of us but we are all doing the best we can. EOS 2 0 3 Yeah that' s true. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] whats been the weirdest part of the pandemic for you? EOS 2 0 5 So I live with my boyfriend and my bestfriend. And I am afraid they are doing skethy stuff behind my back. It sounds crazy, and I don' t have any proof but I have this feeling. The way they talk around each other makes me nervous. EOS 2 1 6 [Question] hmm, tell me more. what do you think is going on? EOS 2 0 7 I' m scared when it is just the two of them here at home. And they are jsut so much more friendly together than before we moved in. EOS 2 1 8 [Question] living together can make people more comfortable with each other. has there been something specific that has caused you to wonder about them> EOS 2 0 9 Not really specifics. It' s more of a just in general sort of thing. I know them both really really well, so I am just picking up on tiny little details. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] i hear you. have you said anything to either one of them? EOS 2 0 11 I have talked to my boyfriend, but he just tells me that it' s crazy I would think something like that. Idk... I don' t want to sound crazy and blow it out of proportion if it' s really nothing. I don' t know if there is actually something I should be worried about, or if I am thinking these crazy thoughts for other reasons. EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] having doubts about relationships is rough. do you know brene brown?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:) EOS 2 0 7 It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am in the UK. It' s sort of a grey area... police won' t really do anything but you can' t buy it over the counter. EOS 2 0 9 One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I' m very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially. EOS 2 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot. The US seems to be really strict on it tho. EOS 2 0 11 It varies, state by state, depending on which party is governing. Which you of course have a version of in the UK. Mayoral elections were today yeah? EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] They were but I didn' t pay much attention:) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that' s all. EOS 2 0 13 Oh, well, I' m sorry to hear that. I think participation in local governance is actually the most achievable path for change, but perhaps how it' s structured where you are, it wouldn' t really matter much if you participated. I guess mayorals are only technically local, not like parliamentary elections. EOS 2 1 14 [Others] If I were in London or a major city I' d vote for Mayor. I am in a rural area and we don' t have one: D. I vote for local councillors tho. EOS 2 0 15 Oh, I take it to mean that you are anti - Khan? If you feel like you' d need to vote for mayor in London. EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I like Khan:) EOS 2 0 17 Jeremy Corbyn, no surrender? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I like him too lol. EOS 2 0 19 You sound like someone I' d like to smoke a spliff with In a moderated manner of course, in relevance to the topic I opened with. EOS 2 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] But I don' t get to vote for London mayor. Only if I were a London resident or nearby would I( sorry for tortured syntax) EOS 2 0 21 Prescriptive grammar is fascism, use whatever words in whatever order you like. Ironic given that I just watched My Fair Lady the other day. EOS 2 1 22 [Self-disclosure] Haha I don' t indulge these days, except for once in a blue moon: P. EOS 2 0 23 You' ve got those weird drug shops in the UK, with synthetics and all that. EOS 2 1 24 [Self-disclosure] Not where I am:( All we have here is sheep and cows. EOS 2 0 25 Let me guess - north/ eastern UK? EOS 2 1 26 [Self-disclosure] North West but close:) EOS 2 0 27 I have a slightly deeper knowledge of the UK than most Americans. I binged Derry Girls in 2 days so my expertise is almost professorial here. EOS 2 1 28 [Others] haha! I am not touching that one:) EOS 2 0 29 It' s a good series but yeah if you don' t skew younger demographic wise I could see why you' d avoid it. You more of a Last Tango In Halifax type? Don' t even watch the Circle? Only Connect? EOS 2 1 30 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I don' t think Derry people would like being referred to as part of the UK;) EOS 2 0 31 True that. But, you know. Legally. EOS 2 1 32 [Self-disclosure] yeah... heh I don' t go there, being half English and half Irish:). But yeah that was so my era.. EOS 2 0 33 I hope one day your people find liberation I think you have helped me a lot with my marijuana problem. EOS 2 1 34 [Self-disclosure] Anyway nice to meet you and all that but I think we have sort of fulfilled the criteria: D.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 3 0 1 Hello. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, i feel like i am in depsression. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed?? EOS 3 0 5 My partner broke up with me impromptu. EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now. EOS 3 0 7 Exactly, that is my current situation. I feel like my entire life has been rearranged. How did you deal with them and specifically what was your coping mechanism? EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days. I slowly realised that i had put myself in slow motion and then slowly started to do things i used to do to maybe come out of it. EOS 3 0 9 True, what ways would you suggest i use to approach my situation and get out of this state? It is very pathetic really when you think of it, halting all your life activities and plans just because a relationship ended. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well i had a close friend that i was able to vent to and help me see what was important. Do you have anyone close in your life you could talk to for guidance?
4 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 4 0 2 I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age? EOS 4 0 4 He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough, both for you and him. I know it' s meaningless to tell you not to be sad, however, you can think that he' s not in a better place. EOS 4 0 6 I presume you mean now and not not;). Though I simply am not a believer. It just made me think how meaningless life was.. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn' t it? I sometimes think it' s meaningless too. EOS 4 0 8 I do not really know what to do about my feelings. They are not going away. EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I feel you, coping with losing your loved ones is never easy. In fact, it' s confusing when you grieve and even when you recover and move on. EOS 4 0 10 Do you think that people ever really recover from a significant bereavement? I think that what you said there was very wise. Maybe it' s worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened.. there is guilt that comes with that. EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t think people can completely get over that, you just get used to the pain of not having them around. EOS 4 0 12 Whilst it hurts to think about him being dead, I think that it would hurt more if I had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I just need you to know that whatever your feeling is, it' s completely normal and you shouldn' t feel guilty for having it. EOS 4 0 14 It is just - very hard. I keep thinking about all the times I disagreed with him or did not appreciate him enough and I never got to tell him how much I loved him. EOS 4 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Your dad wouldn' t want to see you grieving everyday either. You should live the way you know he' d love to see. I believe he knew you loved him regardless how much you two argued. EOS 4 0 16 I know that he did:). I had just not expected to lose him at such a comparatively young age. He did not get to enjoy his retirement! EOS 4 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] That' s sad when he spent all his time taking care of the family and yet could not enjoy his free time.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I' m a little bummed because my friend is not only a junkie but he got arrested last week. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ouch! Your friend got arrested for drugs last week? EOS 3 0 3 He got arrested for stealing to fund his addiction. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I had a neighbor who was doing meth, and he got arrested, and that actually saved his life. He had to get sober and look at what he was doing. There is a hard line between helping a friend who is addicted and actually enabling them. Have you ever heard of this? EOS 3 0 5 Sadly my friend has been arrested a few times, spent time in prison, and is fully locked in his lifestyle. He' s such a great person, very funny, nice, but he is lost. EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It can be very hard to watch a loved one destroy their lives. Has anyone every discussed an intervention? EOS 3 0 7 He has alienated all of his friends, including me. I was the last one holding on. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] My husband and I actually have worked with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. We are retired now, but still volunteer. Sometimes we have to let go of our loved ones - they have to hit rock bottom. Very hard to do, but unless they see their behavior as destructive, they don' t want to change. EOS 3 0 9 I agree, I' m afraid that' s what I have to do. Another one of our mutual friends passed away recently to an overdose. I don' t want to lose another friend. EOS 3 1 10 [Others] Have you seen the serenity prayer? Knowing what to do, what not to do and accepting life really is a great thing to ask God for. We can' t change others. Yet you have to find a way to have peace. EOS 3 0 11 Yes. I know I have to let go. I' ve punished myself trying to stay in his life. EOS 3 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] It' s very hard to lose friends to addictions. It' s epidemic in our society now. However, you can pray for them and look for ways to keep your life on track so you don' t get lost focusing on them and not where you want to go.
3 1 0 [Question] Good afternoon how may I help you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello there. I' m suffering with increased depression and I' m not quite clear why. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately? EOS 3 0 3 No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that' s the same for everyone. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression? EOS 3 0 5 I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I' ve always had a low mood but now I' m anxious that it will continue to get worse. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again? EOS 3 0 7 Since lockdown haven' t spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don' t want this to get any worse. What if she isn' t available?. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It wouldn' t hurt to try and reach out. If she isn' t available, there are other services. EOS 3 0 9 What like support groups etc? I' m also sure this isn' t just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It' s weird and a little concerning to be honest. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app. EOS 3 0 11 I hadn' t thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it' s worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn' t available. Sometimes its good to have options. EOS 3 0 13 I' ll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues?. EOS 3 1 14 [Self-disclosure] After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety. It wasn' t until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it. EOS 3 0 15 That must have been difficult to deal with. Mental health affects so many people in so many ways. It' s good that it' s recognised these days at least. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] It was. Luckily I had my doctor to help me. Family members meant well but chalked it up to" that' s what its like to be a mom" but it is more than that. EOS 3 0 17 I think this is why it' s always best to see a professional. I really should try to reconnect with mine. EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I agree. There is a lot of well meaning advice out there, but its best to see a professional to really help you. EOS 3 0 19 Thanks for the chat, it has helped me put things in perspective. EOS 3 1 20 [Greeting] I' m glad I could help. I hope you get to speak with your psychiatrist, or at least find a good one through an app.

3 1 0 [Question] Good evening! What can I help you with tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I am dealing with pandemic depression. We are completely isolated. Can' t see friends, family, hug grandkids... EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] That is extremely understandable. The pandemic is an event no one was prepared for, and it has cause unforseen upheavals.. That is a tough situation, being isolated physically from those that you love. I' m sorry you' re going through that. EOS 3 0 3 It' s been going on for months with no end in sight. EOS 3 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are you at least able to maintain contact through text and video chats?. EOS 3 0 5 How do you deal with it? Yes, some video chats, but not the same. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, I make sure I continue to maintain my relationships as well as possible through the avenues I have available. It is definitely not the same, but it' s what we have at the moment. Personally, I try to maintain a routine. First hour after I wake up is coffee time, coffee and social media scroll time. EOS 3 0 7 Then there is my wife. She is very paranoid about the virus. She sanitizes the house even though no one comes in it. Bitches at me. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] That sounds very stressful, I' m sorry to hear that.. EOS 3 0 9 I appreciate your concern. It helps to have someone to vent to. Is this going to end soon??? EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I definitely cannot answer that. As long as people keep valuing one another though, we will get through it..
0 0 0 hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hi. How' s it goin'? Are you feeling troubled about something this morning? I know it can be hard to talk about personal problems sometimes. I have a lot of trouble with that myself. EOS 0 0 2 going smooth, i need to get a nice and a surprise able present for my parent, and at the same time I need to pay my house bills. my father understands the situation that my earning is not that much, but my mum will fuck complain that I am taking care of my wife but not her. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you' re having some cash flow issues, right? I can relate to that at a few more points in my life than I' d points in my life than I' d like to recall. It' s so very loving and sweet of you to be putting so much thought into the gift! That isn' t all that common anymore, unfortunately.. Are you currently working?
5 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling today? EOS 5 0 1 uninspired. broken. a rock. a static object. bananas. EOS 5 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, that' s a start. Do I hear you saying that you' re confused at the moment? EOS 5 0 3 not confused. frustrated that I have to produce art for marks when I am not inspired. EOS 5 1 4 [Question] Ah I hear you, education can be both wonderful and difficult can' t it? What are you supposed to produce? EOS 5 0 5 painting after painting. like I am an ikea machine, photocopying picasos for A' s. EOS 5 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that that is very frustrating. Would you consider switching majors? EOS 5 0 7 What is life but a stage. Art is life. I love art.. no. EOS 5 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass. Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of your future and one day it will pay off? EOS 5 0 9 does the sun now set and then rise again. Does the spring not come after winter. Yet I cannot see how art will give me grades. EOS 5 1 10 [Question] Well, I am assuming that you want to go into an artistic field on graduation? EOS 5 0 11 yes, but no like a 9 - 5 job. perhaps i am yet another art failure. art has no time. EOS 5 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you are putting yourself down unnecessarily. Many people do make a lucrative career from an art qualification. I would urge you to keep working to the best of your ability and see what happens.
5 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. I' m here to listen. EOS 5 0 1 The unemployment office is overwhelmed and I' m overwhelmed trying to help my family member. EOS 5 1 2 [Providing Suggestions or Information] These days all of us have this situation. I can assure you that your family can understand it. How about an online job? EOS 5 0 3 Yes, it just very frustrating. My family member has taken another restaurant job only to lose it again for the same reasons, COVID. They have been going to temp services also. EOS 5 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I also worked in a coffee house and it has been closed for this damn virus. I feel sad too. But we should go on. EOS 5 0 5 The job center' s can only help so much. And if they don' t have internet skills, then online jobs will help. EOS 5 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] This sounds good.
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. EOS 3 0 16 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. EOS 3 0 18 That is a good point.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. EOS 3 0 20 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand. EOS 3 0 22 I should trust my partner more than any random person. EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters. EOS 3 0 24 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? EOS 3 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you.... even after work. EOS 3 0 26 okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. EOS 3 0 28 That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you? EOS 3 0 30 Okay. I will keep that in mind. We are 22. EOS 3 1 31 [Question] Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? EOS 3 0 32 Yes but less over the past few months. EOS 3 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related.... for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. EOS 3 0 34 That' s understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. EOS 3 1 35 [Providing Suggestions or Information] How do you all generally communicate? Through text?
2 0 0 Hey. I am really scared about my job prospects. I am really fearful about my job situation. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] When did this fear start? EOS 2 0 2 It has been a while. I have had fears going back to my childhood traumas. I think that the work situation has only exacerbated that. The current economic climate has really made me fearful.... not sure if I am going to be able to keep my job. EOS 2 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct?
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, what brings you to seek support, today? EOS 4 0 1 I am having ongoing depression. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin? EOS 4 0 3 I have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It first began a couple of weeks ago. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I am sad and anxious about the coronavirus. I miss seeing my friends and family. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you must really care about your friends and family, and this awful pandemic is prevent your from seeing them. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, definitely. I hope the pandemic will end. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all? EOS 4 0 9 I haven' t thought about dying at all. I take medication each day for my depression, but there are times when I still feel sad. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay, thanks for sharing that personal information. I only ask because thoughts of suicide are normal and anxiety and depression increase the chances of suicide.
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state. EOS 0 0 6 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well. EOS 0 0 8 Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing( which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all. I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out.
1 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 1 0 1 I am just a little angry. My mother and I had another blow - up. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother? EOS 1 0 3 It is why I am angry. This occurs at least every other day. I say something harmless and she thinks I am saying it in a way that is rude or something. EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you can figure out a way to communicate better. EOS 1 0 5 I do not know for sure where to start. If I try to tell her that is not what I mean it is like she doesn' t understand? EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to feel misunderstood. EOS 1 0 7 For example today I was just saying I like the food she had cooked us for supper. She took that to mean I never liked the food she made before. She says I do not appreciate her and I should be grateful to have her. EOS 1 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing your best to be nice but it isn' t getting through. EOS 1 0 9 Maybe it was the way she was brought up that she is so sensitive. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everybody has stuff from their past that affects them. EOS 1 0 11 But they should not take how they feel on others right? But I know I have to be understanding. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You should be understanding, especially since you already know this. EOS 1 0 13 Can you relate to this situation? EOS 1 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have had personal disputes with my parents in the past. Most of the time there' s other things going on that makes a person act different. EOS 1 0 15 Maybe I could just take deep breath and kind of step back a minute before I respond. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It would be good to do that. Maybe try to have a conversation and tell her you support her no matter what she' s going through. EOS 1 0 17 I guess the best time to do that was when she is in a very good mood. EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do some chores or something that helps her out and just let her know you want to have a serious talk some time. EOS 1 0 19 But what if she thinks me helping her out is criticizing the way she does things? That seems like the way she would be. EOS 1 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try giving reassurance that you want to show you care. EOS 1 0 21 I will try this. It is worth a shot. We can' t go through life being upset at each other. EOS 1 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] I feel the same way. I hope you can get things on better terms. EOS 1 0 23 I appreciated the help. I was just so upset. I didn' t want to talk to anyone in our family and have them take sides or make them uncomfortable. EOS 1 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you can set a better example about being open. EOS 1 0 25 I will try to say things that don' t sound confrontational from now on. EOS 1 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I believe in you.
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! How are you today?
0 0 0 I have anxiety about what avenue to take academically. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello! Don' t worry, I am here to help. So you are saying that you are not sure what career to study?
1 0 0 My friend borrowed money from me but she won' t return it now. EOS 1 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry about that. It is always hard when we trust someone and they let us down. is that waht you are feeling? Disappointment in your friend?
4 1 0 [Question] Good evening. What would you like to talk about? EOS 4 0 1 evening. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you feeling at the moment?
3 0 0 hello. how are you today? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today?. EOS 3 0 2 a bit sad. more depressed. its just i keep getting benched at work. i' m not really sure what do to.* to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset. EOS 3 0 4 i' m not really sure what i' m doing wrong. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though. EOS 3 0 6 what can i do though? EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there' s anything going on? EOS 3 0 8 hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Of course! That sounds frustrating to not know why it' s happening and not have the opportunity to ask.
1 1 0 [Question] Hi - how are you today? EOS 1 0 1 hey! an doing better but things at work place gets me real down. EOS 1 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What' s going on at work that' s making you upset? EOS 1 0 3 i think boss hate me. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That can be very uncomfortable. Are there reason you feel that way?
4 1 0 [Question] What is going on today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling really down about my breakup. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] \ So you have had a breakup recently and you are feeling down about it. EOS 4 0 3 Yes. I thought that it wouldn' t be terrible because I initiated it but now I regret it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] So are you doubting that you made the right decision or are you just feeling sadness at the loss you are feeling right now.
1 0 0 I' m having issues with my parents. You can say we are having a conflict. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] What kind of issues do you think you are having? EOS 1 0 2 well they won' t allow me to date this girl i met online.. They told she' s bad news. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today. Have you tried talking to you parents about why she is" bad news"? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, i tried but it won' t get through their head. There are so old school. They want me to date someone close to my age. is 15 year difference too big of a gap? EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] The basic problem is that your parents believe that 15 years is too large of an age gap between you guys. Is there any other reasons your parents dissaporve of her? EOS 1 0 6 They told me she' s gold digger. Yes i come from money but hey this girl is the one.. EOS 1 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You believe that the girl is not a gold digger, but instead you guys like each other for who you are. Money is not an issue for you guys? EOS 1 0 8 nope not at all. hmm well she does ask to use my credit card alot. my parents foot the bill.. EOS 1 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps you should try to talk to your parents around this fact. For example, if money is the problem for your parents, you can set some rules. LIke you can set an allowance for how much money you can use each week. EOS 1 0 10 Ok, i will talk to them this weekend. what' s better on the phone or in person? EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you want a better communication, I believe in person will be best. EOS 1 0 12 hate talking to my parents face to face, all they do is yell and i get frustrated. EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I apologize and I do agree it is sometimes difficult. Perhaps it will be better to talk to them with another person present. EOS 1 0 14 That' s a great idiea. i will bring my g. f or is that a bad idea?. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If another person is present, it may make it easier. However, I believe it should be someone that is not invovled in this issue. Perhaps another family member or a close family friend. EOS 1 0 16 gotcha. i will bring my good friend. i' m sure he can help me out. great advice by the way. i' m so mad though why my parents care who i date. man i' m old enough. let me make my choices. EOS 1 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Parents have a difficult time understanding their child at times. Hopefully, through this you all can become closer.
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work. EOS 4 0 14 Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn' t even want me to help her, no she doesn' t work. EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family. EOS 4 0 16 Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] How long has it been since she moved in. EOS 4 0 18 A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you thought about a housewarming gift. EOS 4 0 20 Hmm, no I didn' t think about that, that may be a good idea. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So just a week and she is settling in. EOS 4 0 22 Yes, but the home came furnished and honestly, I didn' t think there was that much to do, but maybe I should get a gift, to break the ice. EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Friendship is important maybe she needs to hear from you. EOS 4 0 24 Yes, it is very important, I just felt if I called I would be bothering her:( EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style. EOS 4 0 26 That is possible, and it is a HUGE house, 4 stories. EOS 4 1 27 [Question] Have you tried to visit her and see if you can help. EOS 4 0 28 No, we are not seeing each other in person due to COVID. Do you think I should try calling or texting first? EOS 4 1 29 [Reflection of feelings] sometimes people get overwhelmed and need a friend to be there. EOS 4 0 30 Yes, they certainly do, darn COVID stops everything. EOS 4 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would be a great idea, especially with the holidays.
4 0 0 I face the situation of me being sad because I thought we could let this fight go over time but instead it has lead to us breaking up. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about the fight? EOS 4 0 2 Yes, so we had a fight previously over Thanksgiving Break about how I woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. Then I pick her up to go try and get breakfast... then she starts punching me while I drive so I pull over. Then she keeps hitting me until I tell her to stop. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple. Is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else? EOS 4 0 4 It is because I do really miss her. I really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Breakups are hard, but it sounds like she was violent. EOS 4 0 6 Yeah she was a little violent. I was honestly a little scared for my life for a second but people make mistakes. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Have you talked since then? EOS 4 0 8 We have talked a little bit before hand this month. It was okay but I am still sad about what happened. She was very open to talking and such but I just wasn' t ready because my family found out about what happened and are worried about my safety. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If safety is an issue, then I think that maybe moving on is a good decision. EOS 4 0 10 I know but I am so sad because the break up was so quick and we did not really have closure after the whole fight happened between us. I still keep on thinking about her. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. Don' t be in a hurry to get into a new relationship, but if one happens that would be great too. Is this your first breakup? EOS 4 0 12 I will definitely try to get over her using those techniques you just said. It' s way harder to do than say though. No, this is not my first breakup with a woman but I felt like she was the one for me. EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] Breakups are not always the end, but they usually happen for a reason, and whenever violence is involved it is usually better to move on.
4 0 0 hi, how are you? My friend, My best friend, has a new friend and hardly has time for me anymore, we have been friend for over ten years. this hurts. EOS 4 1 1 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before. EOS 4 0 2 its so annoying and hurtful. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Yeah i can tell you something you might not want to hear but it ended with us ending our friendship on that level.
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability. EOS 3 0 21 i applied for disability but didn' t get it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself. EOS 3 0 23 yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn' t matter. EOS 3 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Social Security stopped you. Why? EOS 3 0 25 i' m not injured enough for them. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can file against the company if you can prove neglect in the employer.. Were there proper safety guards. EOS 3 0 27 I tried but since it is the state of PA they have immunity. no. EOS 3 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was a state injury, there must be an avenue you can use to prove neglect. EOS 3 0 29 I was told that I assumed the risk of injury working for them. It was a mental hospital. EOS 3 1 30 [Question] have you contacted OSHA and filed a complaint with them? EOS 3 0 31 not yet. I should. EOS 3 1 32 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There should be an avenue for you to seek compensation. EOS 3 0 33 The lawyer fought with them for over a year. There was even an appeal but I lost that too. EOS 3 1 34 [Reflection of feelings] It is unfortunate that safety is not a factor. It was a state hospital?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 hello. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 0 0 3 I need ways alleviate stress while studying. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there. EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck. EOS 0 0 7 How did you push past that job? EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work. EOS 0 0 9 Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career? EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too. EOS 0 0 11 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Can you give me some more details? EOS 0 0 13 I just find the work mundane and way too remedial. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable. EOS 0 0 15 did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job? EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have you a few, there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit. EOS 0 0 17 what types of skill can I gain online? EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Indeed is one of the better ones to look for jobs, honestly I would suggest looking at jobs that you normally wouldn' t and see what kind of qualifications they need and see if you can get that done online. EOS 0 0 19 so filter based on my absolute needs and go for online skills that I can complete? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes I think that is a great idea, look for jobs that meet your needs and figure out what you can do to look attractive to employers. EOS 0 0 21 I have tried glassdoor before, have you had any luck there? EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used it a bit, I mainly used indeed. EOS 0 0 23 and have you showcased your skills using LinkedIn before? I have had that one recommended to me before, they said its a great way to neatly organize accomplishments and personal background. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes especially if you are applying for anything in a professional setting that is very important. EOS 0 0 25 do you have any examples of online skills you completed? EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] coursera has a lot of great courses, it really depends on what you are looking for. EOS 0 0 27 if I was looking to enter the engineering field, any recommendations? EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Is that what you are going to school for? EOS 0 0 29 yes but I may change my mind. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] What year are you in? most engineering programs have a practicum and that is a great opportunity to make contacts and potentially get offered a job. EOS 0 0 31 yes I have been networking as I go. EOS 0 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly you seem like you are pretty on top of this I don' t think you will have any issues finding a job. EOS 0 0 33 yeah I mean the topic was about final exam stress but we got on a tangent. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Yes that is fair enough, how much time do you have until your exam?
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why? EOS 4 0 8 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID - 19 lockdowns. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] How long have you been working there? EOS 4 0 10 I am very sad about this country and my work situation. For 5 years. I work in accounting. EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID - 19 really has got us all down. EOS 4 0 12 What a great nation we live in..... a future 3rd world one. Yeah, but I was a good accountant. EOS 4 1 13 [Others] WOW, I' m sure that is a big change for you... EOS 4 0 14 Yeah, I have not told my wife about it just yet. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] I agree, this country has got some issues but we can get through them. Uh, oh, how do you think she will react? EOS 4 0 16 Yeah, I am not sure. I better wait to break the news in 2021. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there. EOS 4 0 18 And I am not the only one who is losing my job. Seems that all of accounting is going to be getting the axe. It makes me sad.... EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year. Do you have a resume? EOS 4 0 20 Plus, I have a 50 dollar a day spending habit on lottery tickets to one day hit it BIG. Yes, I have a resume that I have not updated just yet. I have a college education and a CPA to boot, but I need one lucky break in life. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes that will help to get a better perspective on things... taking some time away from everything in order to catch a breath. EOS 4 0 22 Maybe I can spend some quality time with my kids without them knowing I will be out of a job as of 01/ 15/ 2021. It is almost Christmas, too. EOS 4 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I hear ya, I feel like that quite a bit. Like if isn' t one thing it' s another. I' m sure your wife will understand how the economy has gotten and that she knows that it isn' t your fault. EOS 4 0 24 Maybe, but we have a huge mortgage and two BMW' s. We spend lavishly.... Plus, I spend 50 dollars a day on lotto. EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times, but remember all the good times you have had. Those would not be good times if it were' nt for tough times. EOS 4 0 26 True, but the Office was my home away from home. I need to figure out how to deal with my sadness..... EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times. Do you have any hobbies? EOS 4 0 28 Yeah, that is a good point. Should I change careers? I like to walk and do pushups on a regular basis; does that count?? EOS 4 1 29 [Others] I don' t think a huge change like that is neccessary, maybe just looking into options. Unemployment and government help until something else comes up. That is an excellent way to help relieve some stress from our daily lives. EOS 4 0 30 Unemployment doesn' t last forever; plus, I have pride in my work. Americans are suppose to be strong. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Exercise also releases endorphins that can make you feel happy. EOS 4 0 32 Any other suggestions? I was thinking about becoming an Uber and Lyft driver. The happiness wears off, however. EOS 4 1 33 [Reflection of feelings] I like to hear that, I am a proud American myself. EOS 4 0 34 Well, thanks for your input. I think this chat has been helpful. I am a proud American! Good bye. EOS 4 1 35 [Greeting] It does wear off, but if you get into a routine of doing it, it will help to alleviate some of that sadness. Ok thank you I hope things get going in the right direction for you. Merry Christmas!
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. EOS 6 0 1 hello. how are you? I wanted to briefly chat about my jealous feeling. My friend sent me a pic as a greeting showing her hubby and I am jealous. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] I am doing good. How are you? EOS 6 0 3 Next time I see her I want to hide my jealous feeling, but not sure if I can do it well. great. I am good. EOS 6 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so, you envy your friend having a good spouse, is that correct? EOS 6 0 5 yes that is correct. EOS 6 1 6 [Question] Are you a female, if I may ask? EOS 6 0 7 yes. EOS 6 1 8 [Question] Do you have a husband or bf? EOS 6 0 9 I could say I am a female that is one of those left out. not currently. I really don' t know how those women find partners and get married and stay with the same partner for a long time. EOS 6 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You get frustrated that other people are achieving something, you are not able to do. Is that a fair understanding? EOS 6 0 11 I think so, I am not complaining but I guess I am haha. EOS 6 1 12 [Question] What do you think about your self as person? Kid, affectionate, caring?* kind.
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you? EOS 1 0 2 Not so good. How are you doing? EOS 1 1 3 [Question] I am doing okay thank you for asking! would you like to talk about whats wrong? EOS 1 0 4 Yes. Well today I had a delivery order. So I went to McDonald' s and pick up the order and took it to the right address and after a few hours I notice that the client did not confirm the order. EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am not knowledgeable in this service industry. Let me understand. You delivered the order, but the customer did not confirm they wanted it.. EOS 1 0 6 Five minutes later my supervisor called me saying that the client call and reported that he did not received his order. And that' s not true at all, I gave him the food. So now i don' t know if they going to fired me or let me keep the job. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation? EOS 1 0 8 Of course I did. He told me he going to give me the benefit of the doubt but that is not enough. Im an honest person and this kind of accusation makes me feel very bad. EOS 1 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I understand, but do not feel bad about yourself. You did your work honestly and delivered the food to your customer. Can I suggest something moving forward?. EOS 1 0 10 Yes. But stuff like that makes me look bad and makes people dont trust me. Sure. That can help. I would appreciate it. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe every time you make a delivery, you can take a picture of it for proof. or maybe you can have a copy of the receipt and have the customer sign it as well. EOS 1 0 12 Well. I normally take pictures of every delivery I make but I let this pass and look what happened. EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] it' s okay, it happens to everyone. we are human and we tend to make the smallest mistakes. The important thing is to learn from them.. Is there anything else bothering you at work? EOS 1 0 14 Yes. It won' t happen again for sure. This makes me dont trust people again. Well. This is the first time I ever faced this kind of problem at work. EOS 1 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] as long as you believe in yourself to be honest, don' t worry about what other people think. Your boss will come to understand you are a honest worker. It is also amazing that you have come such a long way without having other problems. that is great!. EOS 1 0 16 I know but sometimes one small thing can hurt you and ruined the reputation that you had build for a long time. EOS 1 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, i understand what you are saying. It' s really hard to move on from bad experiences, staying positive is important in these situations.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:) EOS 2 0 7 It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am in the UK. It' s sort of a grey area... police won' t really do anything but you can' t buy it over the counter. EOS 2 0 9 One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I' m very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially. EOS 2 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot. The US seems to be really strict on it tho. EOS 2 0 11 It varies, state by state, depending on which party is governing. Which you of course have a version of in the UK. Mayoral elections were today yeah? EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] They were but I didn' t pay much attention:) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that' s all. EOS 2 0 13 Oh, well, I' m sorry to hear that. I think participation in local governance is actually the most achievable path for change, but perhaps how it' s structured where you are, it wouldn' t really matter much if you participated. I guess mayorals are only technically local, not like parliamentary elections. EOS 2 1 14 [Others] If I were in London or a major city I' d vote for Mayor. I am in a rural area and we don' t have one: D. I vote for local councillors tho. EOS 2 0 15 Oh, I take it to mean that you are anti - Khan? If you feel like you' d need to vote for mayor in London. EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I like Khan:) EOS 2 0 17 Jeremy Corbyn, no surrender? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I like him too lol. EOS 2 0 19 You sound like someone I' d like to smoke a spliff with In a moderated manner of course, in relevance to the topic I opened with. EOS 2 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] But I don' t get to vote for London mayor. Only if I were a London resident or nearby would I( sorry for tortured syntax) EOS 2 0 21 Prescriptive grammar is fascism, use whatever words in whatever order you like. Ironic given that I just watched My Fair Lady the other day. EOS 2 1 22 [Self-disclosure] Haha I don' t indulge these days, except for once in a blue moon: P. EOS 2 0 23 You' ve got those weird drug shops in the UK, with synthetics and all that. EOS 2 1 24 [Self-disclosure] Not where I am:( All we have here is sheep and cows. EOS 2 0 25 Let me guess - north/ eastern UK? EOS 2 1 26 [Self-disclosure] North West but close:) EOS 2 0 27 I have a slightly deeper knowledge of the UK than most Americans. I binged Derry Girls in 2 days so my expertise is almost professorial here. EOS 2 1 28 [Others] haha! I am not touching that one:) EOS 2 0 29 It' s a good series but yeah if you don' t skew younger demographic wise I could see why you' d avoid it. You more of a Last Tango In Halifax type? Don' t even watch the Circle? Only Connect? EOS 2 1 30 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I don' t think Derry people would like being referred to as part of the UK;) EOS 2 0 31 True that. But, you know. Legally. EOS 2 1 32 [Self-disclosure] yeah... heh I don' t go there, being half English and half Irish:). But yeah that was so my era.. EOS 2 0 33 I hope one day your people find liberation I think you have helped me a lot with my marijuana problem. EOS 2 1 34 [Self-disclosure] Anyway nice to meet you and all that but I think we have sort of fulfilled the criteria: D. EOS 2 0 35 Yes, have a wonderful evening! Goodbye. EOS 2 1 36 [Self-disclosure] you too! Can you press quit first cos I can' t from this end for some reason:)
3 0 0 hello. anyone there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with today? EOS 3 0 2 am not fine. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What is it that is making you feel this way? EOS 3 0 4 i was cheated on severally, and it resulted me to end the relationship. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you had to deal with a partner recently cheating and a breakup, is this right? EOS 3 0 6 yes thats it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this has been stressful for you and you are trying to figure out how to move on from this.
3 1 0 [Question] hi there? EOS 3 0 1 Hi. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] how are you? what' s new with you? EOS 3 0 3 I am not doing so great. I fell down some stairs the other day and broke my foot and chipped my two front teeth. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that. I feel you because I had an experience about breaking my bones. It was sad story. how you feel right now. EOS 3 0 5 I am grateful for my family they are taking care of me but I am on crutches and am in a boot when I am not icing my foot. EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Very good. I am glad that you have a good family who can support you whenever you need a help. EOS 3 0 7 Yes I am struggling with some depression just because I am feeling a bit isolated with the broken foot along with COVID going on. EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Totally, sad side of our current situation. I hope you can tide - over this hard time soon and you are doing your best at this time. So proud!
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how is your day? EOS 0 0 1 Not good. I was told today that my contract is not being renewed once it ends this month. I am very anxious about finding another job during pandemic. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see, It' s been a difficult year for all of us. But I think it would be possible to negotiate. EOS 0 0 3 But I tried negotiating. They are down - sizing the entire sales department. What else can I do? EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Hmmm, I can see that this is stressful for you. Did you already search for a new job? EOS 0 0 5 Yes I am preparing my resume but job vacancies are few and far between. I am worried about my next job. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Okay then, It' s good that you already started. But first of all stop being panicked.
3 0 0 hello. how are you today? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today?. EOS 3 0 2 a bit sad. more depressed. its just i keep getting benched at work. i' m not really sure what do to.* to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset. EOS 3 0 4 i' m not really sure what i' m doing wrong. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though. EOS 3 0 6 what can i do though? EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there' s anything going on? EOS 3 0 8 hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Of course! That sounds frustrating to not know why it' s happening and not have the opportunity to ask. EOS 3 0 10 yes... hrm. that may work. how can i stop being depressed all the time though.. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' ve also had bosses that are infrequently in the office and make getting good information hard. EOS 3 0 12 how did you fix the issue? i work at home and its like just trying to reach out - they are always busy. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren' t always a reflection of us or how we' re performing. EOS 3 0 14 this whole covid thing has me scrambling to talk to a live person. EOS 3 1 15 [Others] I can imagine! EOS 3 0 16 ok, so just keep pushing and getting good work done? EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I was in a physical office when I had this problem, but the boss rotated between offices. It was hard to wait, but I just kept my head down until the next time she was available. That' s what I did. EOS 3 0 18 maybe i can try that. thank you. i' ll give it a shot. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think reminding yourself that if there was a problem with your work they would be seeking YOU out, and not the other way around. EOS 3 0 20 hrm... that' s a good point! i hadn' t thought of it that way. EOS 3 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] Hopefully that mindset can help you stay positive until you have the chance to speak with them, instead of worrying about what you' ve done wrong. That anxiety feels like what is keeping you down? EOS 3 0 22 i think that will work. it maybe what' s keeping me down. i' ll try yoga too. I' ll give it a shot and just talk with him when i see him online next time. he isn' t online that often because we have 2 separate computers each for our work. well... i hope you have a wonderful night! thank you for all your help! EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I really hope that helps keep you afloat until you can get some real answers. Worrying about what - ifs is harder than just knowing what' s goiong on! EOS 3 0 24 yes i agree. EOS 3 1 25 [Greeting] I hope you feel better soon and are able to clear it up!
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed! EOS 7 0 7 And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that' s one method I have used.. Thank you for your trust in me.. EOS 7 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don' t overdo it.. EOS 7 0 9 I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible. true, very true.. Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen? EOS 7 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you. EOS 7 0 11 Thanks for sympathizing and understanding.. EOS 7 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation. EOS 7 0 13 ok. That' s true and I have to do more of that. Phone is also a big distraction for me. I heard that it' s best to get it out of one' s reach for best results.. Timer, great idea.. EOS 7 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I struggl ed with focus but once I put my phone away, my focus increased a lot. EOS 7 0 15 I think that' s pretty good advice. I know which room I can do this, but just away from temptation plus having an alarm from the other room to go off after an hour or so of reading. ok, I will employ these methods more.. Thank you for sharing these. EOS 7 1 16 [Question] Of course! Is anything else on your mind? EOS 7 0 17 then hopefully after these two courses are done, I can have renewed faith and maturity after the new year and take new courses with better results.. not much, just academic pressure and how to deal with time management and being contentious.. EOS 7 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, that sounds like a great idea. It sounds like you' re really trying to help yourself grow. EOS 7 0 19 Yes I hope so, because when I was younger, I used to be great at not being distracted so much in my studies and just bang it out real quick and well with my books. and all this is also worsened by the pandemic, I am afraid, of just not having a renewed from the indoor isolation.. EOS 7 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, it' s true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood. I understand how you' re feeling, COVID has affected me negatively as well but I' m just trying to look at the bright side. EOS 7 0 21 yes it has on us all. I guess the other thing is that my city has been doing fine so far, but just the past two weeks or so has been more and more cases, so just getting stressed and depressed with that and prospects of a second shut down.. so yes, the second wave is here it seems( belatedly), but hopefully it doesn' t get worse, because I have seen worse in other places right now. EOS 7 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I would suggest taking up yoga or meditation to lessen the stress COVID has on your brain. EOS 7 0 23 so I suppose just trying to cope with that also because I get nervous having to go out for work or errands, and I also have to write my exam outside of my home.. ok. I could look into that. I work out in general, but have been slacking off on those ever since the pandemic started this year.. EOS 7 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I' d recommend wearing a mask whenever you go out to lessen the chance of you contracting anything. At the moment, it' s all we could do. EOS 7 0 25 yes and I have been and will continue to do that.. EOS 7 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s great! EOS 7 0 27 But aside from these stressors, I think I have a better idea now on how I should proceed, starting today. EOS 7 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s amazing, I' m glad I could help put your mind at ease. EOS 7 0 29 not that I haven' t, but just with more renewed faith and having fresh priorities in my head.. yes thank you very much for listening and understanding with my issues.. EOS 7 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] Of course, sometimes we all just need to talk to someone. EOS 7 0 31 your input has been helpful and it does help for me to kind of vent out on what has been bothering me. yes so true. Thank you for that.. EOS 7 1 32 [Others] of corurse!

EOS 1 0 3 A friend screwed me out of money and a business venture. I am no longer friends with her. We were really close before this.. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! I am so sorry that has happened to you. That must feel like such a betrayal. Can you tell me more about it?
0 0 0 Hello? Is anyone there? Is anyone there. HELLO? no one is supporting me here..:: twiddles thumbs:: the instructions for the support seeker are incorrect as there is no button that has shown for" the partner' s reasons".. the supporter did not respond. This test is skewed. No one is here to chat with. even after being matched. Ridiculous. hello????? hello? no other messages except my own are showing up. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Sorry, I had a bad connection. Hello, what can I help you with? EOS 0 0 2 Hi. i wasn' t sure anyone was there. i left my job about three months after 8 years.. haven' t found another one.. trying to find one has been challenging. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Just be clear, you' re worried about finding a new job? EOS 0 0 4 well, yeah. in the middle of a pandemic, and being in a new town. all of that has been really hard. and stressful. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a difficult position to be in. It is a hard time, but there' s always a way to persevere.
3 1 0 [Question] Hi! Hope you are doing well? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, yes am doing well. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Glad to know that you are doing well. How may I assist you today?
4 0 0 Hello. Is anyone there. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you today? EOS 4 0 2 I' m doing good. I need some advice. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] What can I help you with? EOS 4 0 4 Lately, my friends started to make jokes about my face being ugly. They even called my face as flat as a pan! What should I do? I see them everyday on the bus. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried confronting them and asking why they are being bullies? EOS 4 0 6 I did and they respond by saying that they are just joking and that I' m handsome. But it' s starting to get on my nerves because it' s all they make fun about every time they see me! EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you are very handsome! They could just be jealous. EOS 4 0 8 Haha I would hope so. Still though, it makes me want to avoid them when I go to school on the bus. What do you think I should do then? EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I understand, school was tough for me too. I suggest you tell them to knock it off or you can sit somewhere away from the bus. EOS 4 0 10 Should I just beat them up with my backpack. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No, beating them up will only get you in trouble and that won' t help. EOS 4 0 12 There' s another bus route. Should I just take that instead. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that could be a good idea if it' s not too far out of your way.
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 1 0 1 I could be better. How about U? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] I am doing well. Whats bothering you? EOS 1 0 3 A friend screwed me out of money and a business venture. I am no longer friends with her. We were really close before this.. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! I am so sorry that has happened to you. That must feel like such a betrayal. Can you tell me more about it? EOS 1 0 5 It does. I' ve known her for 14 years and we dated. I invested a lot of money in a business she wanted to do. She took the money and ran. EOS 1 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back. EOS 1 0 7 What do you suggest? EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Did you sign anything? or have proof of what happened? EOS 1 0 9 No. Other than the money I transferred to her. Hello? EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What was the business? It depends on your location but I' m sure just on the transaction alone that shows some kind of intent. or text messages saying it was for a specific purpose? EOS 1 0 11 A cat cafe. Where you can hang out and work or drink with adoptable cats from the local shelter.. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you gave her a large amount of money and have any kind of messages about it I would look into trying to get it back. EOS 1 0 13 I gave her 80K. No messages. It was all done in person. Do you think I should get a lawyer and call the cops? EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would seek the advice of a lawyer. I' m sorry this has happened thats horrible.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 hello. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 0 0 3 I need ways alleviate stress while studying. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there. EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today. EOS 3 0 2 I feel bad putting this on your shoulders, maybe you can help. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] i have big shoulders! whats on your mind? EOS 3 0 4 I' m just struggling a lot to find the motivation to do anything at all, even the most basic of things. Sometimes I get very intense feelings of sadness and just want to drop everything I' m doing, like I can' t do anything more. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] i think a lot of people are feeling that way these past few months. do you think it is covid related? not sickness, more depression. EOS 3 0 6 Yes that' s very true, depression is probably hitting people the worst right now. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] its becoming a new normal lol. EOS 3 0 8 No I' ve been fighting depression since I was probably like 12 years old, it first really hit me when I moved from where I was living all my life and lost all my friends and I was terrified. Now I' m 29. But covid definitely plays a factor. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] a few months ago i was feeling the same way. i dont have health insurance but googled and found some online docturs. i got to see a doc and get on antidepressants for less than a hundred. covid plays a factor in EVERYTHING ugh. EOS 3 0 10 So you had the therapy session online with them via webcam or you found them online first then went to see them in person. Yeah covid is doing damage in more ways than one. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] all online!:) meds shipped to my door. i love it! EOS 3 0 12 Wow that' s great. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] theres a free site called 7 cups that does free peer to peer couseling too. its good when i have a lot on my mind. EOS 3 0 14 I would have to do it in person, I don' t want people I live with to hear about all my pathetic mental problems. Oh 7 cups, I had an account there and met a really nice girl there that was helping me and she was living with an abusive family at the same time, its crazy but now I can' t access that account anymore, I' m so sad about that. I think it says the account doesn' t exist when I try to login now. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] can you make a new one? EOS 3 0 16 Sure I guess I' ll have to do that but I really wanted to get back into that account, don' t want to lose contact with that girl that was helping me. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] cerebral is that one site with the cheap docs. EOS 3 0 18 do you mean um.... cheap med? cerebral seems to be an antidepressant when i googled. EOS 3 1 19 [Others] check the website q and a. EOS 3 0 20 oh wait nevermind i spoke too soon. EOS 3 1 21 [Others] for cups maybe thers a contact you can email to try to regain access. EOS 3 0 22 Yeah definitely, I should try contacting their support to try and restore my account. EOS 3 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] they are doing so much things now, you just gotta get on google and see whats out there! i think you are going to be okay, there are definately tough times but you seem to have a grip on knowing what you need. that is great. EOS 3 0 24 Yeah, I gotta do therapy thats a must and I think it has to be in person so I can try to let some of it out with someone face to face....... but that' s going to be very hard, to trust someone and open up about everything because its not just depression. Online is convenient but its just too much going on. EOS 3 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i agree, just with all the covid crap i know it can be hard to get a face to face!:) EOS 3 0 26 Right... EOS 3 1 27 [Affirmation and Reassurance] its great that you know what you need to do though adn that you know what helps. is there anytihng else you want to talk about? EOS 3 0 28 Ah I don' t know it' s too much, I don' t want to make this hours long. But thank you for talking a little bit about it with me and sharing those resources. Hopefully I can find a' natural' way to fix these things without taking meds that might change who I am for the worst or something. Hope you have a nice night and stay healthy, you and your family. EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] hang in there!
1 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 1 0 1 I am just a little angry. My mother and I had another blow - up. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother? EOS 1 0 3 It is why I am angry. This occurs at least every other day. I say something harmless and she thinks I am saying it in a way that is rude or something. EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you can figure out a way to communicate better. EOS 1 0 5 I do not know for sure where to start. If I try to tell her that is not what I mean it is like she doesn' t understand? EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to feel misunderstood. EOS 1 0 7 For example today I was just saying I like the food she had cooked us for supper. She took that to mean I never liked the food she made before. She says I do not appreciate her and I should be grateful to have her. EOS 1 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing your best to be nice but it isn' t getting through. EOS 1 0 9 Maybe it was the way she was brought up that she is so sensitive. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everybody has stuff from their past that affects them. EOS 1 0 11 But they should not take how they feel on others right? But I know I have to be understanding. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You should be understanding, especially since you already know this. EOS 1 0 13 Can you relate to this situation? EOS 1 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have had personal disputes with my parents in the past. Most of the time there' s other things going on that makes a person act different. EOS 1 0 15 Maybe I could just take deep breath and kind of step back a minute before I respond. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It would be good to do that. Maybe try to have a conversation and tell her you support her no matter what she' s going through. EOS 1 0 17 I guess the best time to do that was when she is in a very good mood. EOS 1 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do some chores or something that helps her out and just let her know you want to have a serious talk some time. EOS 1 0 19 But what if she thinks me helping her out is criticizing the way she does things? That seems like the way she would be. EOS 1 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try giving reassurance that you want to show you care.
2 0 0 how can i find a jobs in my area. What kind of jobs open right now. EOS 2 1 1 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried the classified ads? Or check on facebook for a jobs page in your area? EOS 2 0 2 No. EOS 2 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest starting with one of those options.. do you have a resume? EOS 2 0 4 I don' t have resume. EOS 2 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest you type one up, most employers want an application and a resume. EOS 2 0 6 I will need somebody type one for me. EOS 2 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps a friend can help you, if not they have programs on the web to help assist with that. EOS 2 0 8 Thanks so much. EOS 2 1 9 [Question] Have you been out of work for a while? your welcome. EOS 2 0 10 Yes, I did, EOS 2 1 11 [Question] Are you saying you have been out of work for a while? EOS 2 0 12 Yes, but I have something to do at home. EOS 2 1 13 [Question] Okay, are you saying your working from home?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 I' m good. How about you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Very little to complain about today. What brings you here? EOS 3 0 3 Just want to talk some random stuff basically just want a companion. EOS 3 1 4 [Others] How' s the weather where you are? EOS 3 0 5 Still pretty cold and dry in here, how about there? EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Exactly the same. What are you doing to stay warm? EOS 3 0 7 Just in my long pajamas with heater. I don' t really know what to do anymore, I am just lazy on everything. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well you' re resourceful at staying warm, at least. You mentioned wanting a companion, are you living alone? EOS 3 0 9 not really I' m living with my family but I don' t really talk to them anymore I' m just in my room all day. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Is it the stress of the pandemic getting to you& your family, or something else? EOS 3 0 11 It' s something else. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Can you share? EOS 3 0 13 Just a fight from years ago and I decided to not talk to them anymore.. EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] That' s completely your decision, but it can bring us down at times. What are you doing to stay positive during these crazy times in the world? I know you mentioned feeling lazy. Sometimes I make a list of things in the morning that I want to accomplish. Even if I get one done, it' s a win.: -) EOS 3 0 15 I talk to my friends online, play games, watch movies, etc. I know, I should find a productive hobby. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] A hobby could be another outlet for you in addition to talking to your friends online. You don' t have to put too much pressure on yourself for it to be productive. What hobby ideas do you have? EOS 3 0 17 Like painting or learn new skills online like coding, anything that can improve my human capital. EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What a great idea about learning new skills. It would be a great investment of your time, as well as improve your human capital. Win - win. Can you make a plan to research some places where you can sign - up for a coding class? Maybe research the next few days, and commit to starting in the nest 2 - 3 weeks? You would also meet others like yourself online also trying to learn a new skill. EOS 3 0 19 I have a book, I mostly research in online if I can' t understand it fully or watch youtube tutorials. EOS 3 1 20 [Others] Then you already have a plan. I like it. It' s good to have something to focus on. When is your goal to finish the book? EOS 3 0 21 A month maybe, idk depends on how much I can handle it. EOS 3 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know you can handle it. You speak very well and I just think you need a touch of motivation. We all do! Come back and talk after you finish your next chapter?
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday? EOS 6 0 2 I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I' m too scared to do anything about it as I don' t want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can' t help it. EOS 6 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through. EOS 6 0 4 Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I' m a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self - respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it. EOS 6 0 6 What happened out of interest when you had the conversation? EOS 6 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist. Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more. Since that time, he denies everything. EOS 6 0 8 I know. I' m a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It' s superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas' punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends.. EOS 6 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly, its not anyone else' s business. IF you' re suspicions are in fact correct, then you' ve got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart - breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she' s cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o= is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER! Curiously, why do you think she' s cheating? EOS 6 0 10 I' m almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two.. EOS 6 1 11 [Question] Hmm... So have you two live together? How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation? EOS 6 0 12 That' s just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven' t approached it with her because I' m scared see will just leave and I' ll be a laughing stock. I suppose I' m a joke either way! EOS 6 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There' s always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations. EOS 6 0 14 very true. I suppose I have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think I should just talk to her? EOS 6 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful... I only want to help you.. EOS 6 0 16 not at all. I appreciate your candour. EOS 6 1 17 [Question] But if you feel as though you' re a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you' re getting hurt? I know that you don' t want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty? EOS 6 0 18 All this is tied up with who and I know I' m valuing the wrong things. You are right actually. I think some of this comes from my low self - esteem. having a 9 helps with that. but maybe I need to deal with it directly. EOS 6 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] I wholly believe you should gently but steadfastly confront her. I absolutely do not mean to suggest a dispute or argument. That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you KNOW aren' t acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them. Also, its okay to talk about how that stuff makes you feel, but try not to project your feelings as her fault. I know that it seems like they are... But she didn' t MAKE you feel any specific way, even if her ACTIONS influenced how you were already feeling..
4 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling really sad and lonely right now. My boyfriend and I broke up and it was me who wanted it but now I regret breaking up and he doesn' t want me back. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, I can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it' s too late. EOS 4 0 3 That is exactly it. I broke up with him because I liked another person but then quickly realized that I made a mistake and it' s too late. I want him back should I start calling and going to his house to beg? EOS 4 1 4 [Question] nobody knows him better than you do, right now I do not think he is in a good place either since it wasn' t his choice to end it, how do you think he would react if you started pressuring him?. EOS 4 0 5 I haven' t really thought of that yet. He has a pretty short temper actually. I know he is really mad at me so I think he might want to yell at me and get his anger out before he could start being nice to me again. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this, perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel, without pressuring him into a response. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah, that' s true. I have been secretly watching his social media and he has girls asking him out and I don' t want to let them get to him before I can get him back. I want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] you can always ask him calmly if he would like to talk, so you both have a chance to express your feelings in a safe way, with no yelling or arguing, do you think that' s something he would do? EOS 4 0 9 I can try that, I think he might be responsive at first if I dont set him off. All of his friends hate me so I have nobody on my side right now. Should I try to get his friends to like me again? Is that an way I could use to get him to want me again? EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] nobody likes to see that one' s friend is sad because of someone else, I think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back. EOS 4 0 11 I can understand what you mean. I need to think this through. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] what made you like someone else in the first place? EOS 4 0 13 Well, we are in a small town and he was popular and the cutest guy in our town. I liked being with someone so popular. He wasn' t always nice to me and is why I wanted to be with someone else for a short time. He used to leave me at parties and go off with his friends sometimes. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] was it a common thing that he didn' t give you the attention you wanted? EOS 4 0 15 My friends always said that I could do better and that he didn' t deserve me. He gave me statis in our town and everyone wanted to be his girlfriend so I think I liked the attention, yes. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] were you happy with him or were you happy that you were with the popular guy?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, I' m here to listen. What' s going on? EOS 0 0 1 Thank you. I' ve lost my job and I' m very nervous about the future. As a result I am having a hard time sleeping. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Wow, that' s very hard. I would be anxious too. EOS 0 0 3 That makes me feel a lot better. Have you ever lost your job? EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I have. I was laid off. It was nerve - racking, but also really sad. EOS 0 0 5 What helped you get through it? EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I had a bit in savings, but I looked for new jobs mostly. I was on unemployment insurance for about a month before I found a new job. Have you made any plans yet about how to move forward? I can offer some suggestions if you would like. I know about a lot of resources. EOS 0 0 7 I am a gig worker, so I cannot apply for IU. Its very hard, but i also have some savings. What kind of tools would you recommend I use to get through this. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, falling back on savings while you look for more work is good for a while. If you have any food insecurity as a result, there are often local food banks. It' s really not something to be embarrased about, so many people face food insecurity through no fault of their own. You could also give a call to your local social services because they will be able to tell you what resources would be available, whether it' s a vocational program or temporary assistance. EOS 0 0 9 Wow you' re so helpful and encouraging! It' s very nice to talk to you.. Are there any meds you can recommend to help me sleep? EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, if it' s possible, I would talk to a doctor. If you' re looking for Over - the - counter sleep medication, melatonin has helped me in the past.
3 0 0 Hi. I am Mike. Live in central Kansas and have been very depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that, is there a particular reason or instance for you feeling this way?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 hello. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 0 0 3 I need ways alleviate stress while studying. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there. EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck. EOS 0 0 7 How did you push past that job? EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work. EOS 0 0 9 Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career? EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too. EOS 0 0 11 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Can you give me some more details? EOS 0 0 13 I just find the work mundane and way too remedial. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable. EOS 0 0 15 did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job? EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have you a few, there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit. EOS 0 0 17 what types of skill can I gain online? EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Indeed is one of the better ones to look for jobs, honestly I would suggest looking at jobs that you normally wouldn' t and see what kind of qualifications they need and see if you can get that done online. EOS 0 0 19 so filter based on my absolute needs and go for online skills that I can complete? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes I think that is a great idea, look for jobs that meet your needs and figure out what you can do to look attractive to employers.
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability. EOS 3 0 21 i applied for disability but didn' t get it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself. EOS 3 0 23 yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn' t matter. EOS 3 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Social Security stopped you. Why? EOS 3 0 25 i' m not injured enough for them. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can file against the company if you can prove neglect in the employer.. Were there proper safety guards. EOS 3 0 27 I tried but since it is the state of PA they have immunity. no. EOS 3 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was a state injury, there must be an avenue you can use to prove neglect. EOS 3 0 29 I was told that I assumed the risk of injury working for them. It was a mental hospital. EOS 3 1 30 [Question] have you contacted OSHA and filed a complaint with them? EOS 3 0 31 not yet. I should. EOS 3 1 32 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There should be an avenue for you to seek compensation.
5 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling today? EOS 5 0 1 uninspired. broken. a rock. a static object. bananas. EOS 5 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, that' s a start. Do I hear you saying that you' re confused at the moment? EOS 5 0 3 not confused. frustrated that I have to produce art for marks when I am not inspired. EOS 5 1 4 [Question] Ah I hear you, education can be both wonderful and difficult can' t it? What are you supposed to produce? EOS 5 0 5 painting after painting. like I am an ikea machine, photocopying picasos for A' s. EOS 5 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that that is very frustrating. Would you consider switching majors? EOS 5 0 7 What is life but a stage. Art is life. I love art.. no. EOS 5 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass. Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of your future and one day it will pay off? EOS 5 0 9 does the sun now set and then rise again. Does the spring not come after winter. Yet I cannot see how art will give me grades. EOS 5 1 10 [Question] Well, I am assuming that you want to go into an artistic field on graduation? EOS 5 0 11 yes, but no like a 9 - 5 job. perhaps i am yet another art failure. art has no time. EOS 5 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you are putting yourself down unnecessarily. Many people do make a lucrative career from an art qualification. I would urge you to keep working to the best of your ability and see what happens. EOS 5 0 13 you speak the truth. I will again pick up my brush and see where my inspiration takes me. oh it has been a joy talking to you. EOS 5 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you ever tried searching for information about careers in your field? We still have a few minutes left:) There are a lot of different ways in which you can use an art degree! EOS 5 0 15 Yes. we do. I will call my newest work the brilliant support of mturk! pls give me more inspriation. EOS 5 1 16 [Others] That sounds like a definite winner:) I see a Turner prize beckoning in your future. EOS 5 0 17 wow. Turner. are you in the UK? is the UK. EOS 5 1 18 [Others] Yes I am, where are you? EOS 5 0 19 USA. EOS 5 1 20 [Others] Ah.. well hopefully things will pick up for you next year. Well it' s been lovely talking, I wish you all the best!
3 0 0 I' m so depressed, I just got layed off. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I am sorry to hear that, did you apply for unemployment benefit? That at least can help you financially until you get a new job. EOS 3 0 2 Yes, it will take weeks and the holidays are just around the corner. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sucks it happens so close to the holidays. I understand it' s hard to accept but I' d recommend talking with someone close to you like a friend and family member. EOS 3 0 4 I know, with all the other crap going on now everyone else has their own problems they don' t want to hear mine. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure someone will be there for you, they know you need them the most right now. If you don' t feel comfortable talking to them, you can seek online therapist. There are a lot of free service for mental car. EOS 3 0 6 They' re busy with other people' s problems. I' ll deal with it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It' s not gonna be easy, but at the same time not impossible. Try looking at it a different way. You can use this time to train your skills or do things that you' ve wanted to but didn' t have the time. EOS 3 0 8 I wanted to travel but that' s not a good idea right now. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] You can still travel domestically or just around your city. I like taking a walk in the park or wandering downtown to clear my mind. EOS 3 0 10 I live in a small town and were are suppose to self quarantine unless we have to leave the house for work or go to the store. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] that really sucks. Do you have a garden at home? In the mean time, try following youtube or other channels to work out, it helps you distract from current issue and also makes you healthier. A healthy body is needed for a healthy mind. EOS 3 0 12 I did, everything is gone now.. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] what have you been doing lately? EOS 3 0 14 I do like to cook. I' ll probable do more of that now. EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s a great idea, cooking and doing crafts can be helpful for you. Instead of complaining with others, you can just invite them to join cooking with you, that way you can have companion. EOS 3 0 16 That is a good idea but nobody is suppose to go to other peoples houses. EOS 3 1 17 [Self-disclosure] you can do video chat while cooking. I do virtual happy hour with my friends right now too.
4 0 0 Hi. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing these days? EOS 4 0 2 Not good. You? EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry to hear that. I am doing fine and hope I can cheer you up. EOS 4 0 4 Good to hear. Been feeling lonely due to this pandemic. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I totally understand it. I felt lonely too by staying home all the time. But I found we can borrow books online. A good book can really help. EOS 4 0 6 Do you mean physical or ebooks? EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Both will help. But ebooks are easier to get and you don' t need to contact anyone and anything outside your home. EOS 4 0 8 Any genres you would suggest? EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I like biographies. Stories of real people are inspiring. EOS 4 0 10 Oh ok. I was thinking about getting a dog, is that a good idea? EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a great idea! Dog is human' s best friend. I would love to have a dog myself.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, my name is Rose, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi Rose. I' m ok, but I get embarrassed about my curly hair. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What about your hair is embarrasing exactly? Curls seem like a lovely thing to have( mine is dead straight, lets trade lol) But no, seriously, what in particular don' t you like about it? i admire people who have natural curls. EOS 4 0 3 They are unruly and not the pretty kind of curls. Often get frizzy by the end of the day. It get' s frustrating when I always look a mess. EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I could see that being frustrating, if you can' t keep them neat. is your hair short or long? EOS 4 0 5 It is long. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you thought of having it shorter, it might be easier to tame? Just a thought.... you say you always look like a mess... is that your personal opinion or has anyone else commented on your hair? EOS 4 0 7 I started to cut it shorter last time, but my stylist said it would be big. It is hard to find the right product.. It is my personal opinion.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you asked a friend for an honest opinion? EOS 4 0 9 My friend likes my hair, but also says she can see that it is hard to manage. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance.. EOS 4 0 11 I can totally relate to that. I think we always want what we dont have. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One thing I have started doing, since my hair hasn' t been cut for a year due to pandemic, is wearing hats. my hair is driving me crazy, so I get your frustration. Is it long enough to braid? EOS 4 0 13 I went a year without cutting mine as well for the same reason. That is probably why it felt so out of control now that you say that. Now that I am vaccinated I just got it cut. Maybe I will like it better now. Yes, I do like braids. That is a good idea. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] yay! a haircut!!! Congrats. EOS 4 0 15 Thank you. It does make it feel a little better. I hope you can get yours cut soon too. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] one last suggestion: ask more stylists' opinions perhaps? oh thankyou.... had my shot yesterday.... now I have to wait for our lockdown to expire( May 20) so I have a bit more shag to go. EOS 4 0 17 Yes, good idea. It seems it has been so long to be able to do this. Maybe I need to think of a new style. Had my second shot last Thursday so I hope opportunities like a new stylist happen soon. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you googled images for short curly hairstyles? EOS 4 0 19 I will look on Pinterest. Good idea. EOS 4 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Second shot congrats!! Very exciting. Pinterest is a great source for hairstyles as I recall... there are boards and boards of them. Good idea!
2 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Not so great - found out i' m losing my job in january. EOS 2 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] On no I am sorry to hear that! I know that must be tough. EOS 2 0 3 Yes I' m not even sure what steps to take right now. EOS 2 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea that can be difficult. Have you started looking for something else? EOS 2 0 5 Not yet, I' m not even sure where to begin. I have not looked for a job in 20 years. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way. EOS 2 0 7 I' ve tried calling the unemployment office to get some ideas but they do not answer their phones. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Or you could look for some side jobs like cleaning or organizing things until you find something more permanent. EOS 2 0 9 Yeah, i' m kinda old for that - LOL!!! My back would not hold up to that - and my salary wouldn' t be comparable. EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea it seems to be hard to get up with a lot of places at this time. Persistent is the key.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you. EOS 3 0 1 Not doing well. I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Oh no, how long had you been together? EOS 3 0 3 we were together for 2 years. It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Wow, that' s horrible. How do you feel about it?
0 0 0 Hello, is anone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Yes sorry, the app was misbehaving. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I don' t know. I' m shaking because I don' t know what I' m going to do. EOS 0 1 3 [Others] Im sorry to hear that, but going to do about what situation specifically? EOS 0 0 4 I know you' re busy prepping for the holiday but I described my problem earlier. It should be listed either at the top or on the left side of your screen. I know you' re probably prepping for the holiday. I didn' t mean to interrupt your Sunday. EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Im sorry but we do not get those promps. We just get to talk pretty much, we have to find out whats going on. You are not interrupting anything. EOS 0 0 6 Here! Last Christmas I bought the condo of my dreams. This April 2020 I lost my job due Covid 19. My unemployment is ending and my savings are depleted. I' ve recived an eviction notice and don' t know what to do. Help! Have you ever been evicted? EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Where are you that you are able to be evicted? You should not be able to be evicted from your home during this time in pretty much every state. Have you tried contacting anyone for help other than your landlord? EOS 0 0 8 I' m still in my condo but I no longer have a job, umemployment has run out and my savings are all gone. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well the plus side is they cannot kick you out right now. Have you talk to your landlord about working out some payment arrangement. Have you tried applying for any job? Now is not the time for pride to get in the way, i would accept anything.
4 1 0 [Question] Hey there, what' s going on today? EOS 4 0 1 Hello. It is a fine day, how about yourself? EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] It really is! I am just taking in the fresh air in the backyard. EOS 4 0 3 That is awesome. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Thanks! What is going on in your neck of the woods? EOS 4 0 5 Sort of stuck inside trying to make a dime but it is alright. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Yeah great minds think alike.. do you do anything else for work? EOS 4 0 7 Looking for a good job right now. I wanted to talk about a personal issue I have been having, though. EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Okay, you know I' m here for you. Talk to me, what' s happening? EOS 4 0 9 My father and I had a fight 2 years ago and haven' t spoke since. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] The same happened to me, and then my father passed away. If there is anything I can say, is to swallow pride and cherish the moments you have on earth together. What was the fight over? EOS 4 0 11 Yeah I am afraid that these things can happen. It was only over material things. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] That was my next question, what the fight was over. Do you think he would be open to mending things?
3 1 0 [Question] hi how' s it going today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you? EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future? EOS 3 0 5 Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it' s true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online? EOS 3 0 7 Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression. EOS 3 0 9 How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] the" little black rain cloud" people? LOL I try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it' s our first. EOS 3 0 11 Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] While there is a lot to focus on that is just awful, it has really helped me to look back to the spanish flue of 1918. that pandemic was followed byt he roaring 20s. EOS 3 0 13 I know people thinking the country will collapse soon. Hard to deal with them. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The doomsday people are always around. remeber they mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012. EOS 3 0 15 I have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. Especially during the holidays. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] are you familiar with Mr. Rogers' story about looking for the helpers when things go bad? EOS 3 0 17 No but I did love that show as a kid. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Family is hard! So many strong emotions and opinions that aren' t always helpful. anyone in particular for you? EOS 3 0 19 My dad and my GF' s dad both have their own opinons on things. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people. EOS 3 0 21 Yes. I also don' t feel like the world will decent into madness, but they do not believe it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] oooh, that' s hard. are you living at home with your dad? as a mom, i can tell you that the unknown for your children is scary. often fear and lack of control come out sideways. EOS 3 0 23 No but near him and take care of him. EOS 3 1 24 [Self-disclosure] that' s really nice of you. i' m 800+ miles away from my parents. EOS 3 0 25 That is good and bad. I think it is good to talk about though I do feel a little better thank you. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if i can suggest something that might help - brene brown, a leadership coach and researcher has a great TED talk about shame and vunerability and a CUTE cartoon animal video on yourtube about empathy. EOS 3 0 27 Ok thank you very much. I think this is a good stopping point, so thank you for your help. EOS 3 1 28 [Providing Suggestions or Information] those help me focus on how hard it is for everyone around me and that i should be kinder to them. everyone has their own crap.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you. EOS 3 0 1 Not doing well. I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Oh no, how long had you been together? EOS 3 0 3 we were together for 2 years. It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Wow, that' s horrible. How do you feel about it? EOS 3 0 5 I feel lost. I' m so used to her being around everyday. Now I don' t know what to do with myself without her. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year. EOS 3 0 7 Not only that, but with Covid going on I have noone i can see to talk about it. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have any family? EOS 3 0 9 Yes, i do, but they are far away. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Friends closeby? Hobbies? What kind of work do you do? EOS 3 0 11 I do have friends, who are also friends with her. However they have families and do not visit prople because of covid. I don' t have any true hobbies. I don' t think they will fill the void anyways. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow. EOS 3 0 13 I do software development, but its a work at home situation. So i have been just by myself for the last week, and its driving me crazy. All i do is think about why she would do that. I' ve had time to myself but its not getting any better. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have always tried to think of things in a positive way. This way even when something really bad happens, it doesn' t seem so bad as to overwhelm us from recovering.
4 0 0 I face the situation of me being sad because I thought we could let this fight go over time but instead it has lead to us breaking up. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about the fight? EOS 4 0 2 Yes, so we had a fight previously over Thanksgiving Break about how I woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. Then I pick her up to go try and get breakfast... then she starts punching me while I drive so I pull over. Then she keeps hitting me until I tell her to stop. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple. Is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else? EOS 4 0 4 It is because I do really miss her. I really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Breakups are hard, but it sounds like she was violent. EOS 4 0 6 Yeah she was a little violent. I was honestly a little scared for my life for a second but people make mistakes. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Have you talked since then? EOS 4 0 8 We have talked a little bit before hand this month. It was okay but I am still sad about what happened. She was very open to talking and such but I just wasn' t ready because my family found out about what happened and are worried about my safety. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If safety is an issue, then I think that maybe moving on is a good decision. EOS 4 0 10 I know but I am so sad because the break up was so quick and we did not really have closure after the whole fight happened between us. I still keep on thinking about her. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. Don' t be in a hurry to get into a new relationship, but if one happens that would be great too. Is this your first breakup? EOS 4 0 12 I will definitely try to get over her using those techniques you just said. It' s way harder to do than say though. No, this is not my first breakup with a woman but I felt like she was the one for me. EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] Breakups are not always the end, but they usually happen for a reason, and whenever violence is involved it is usually better to move on. EOS 4 0 14 Maybe you' re right! Just need to get productive and get my mind off of her for good since she was violent. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest you start trying to have fun with others and getting yourself out there where there will be new opportunities. EOS 4 0 16 I will definitely try. I know it will be hard because I am upset still but sometimes I guess moving on is the only thing that you can do in this situation. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The sadness will eventually pass and I am sure there is someone out there that will be a good match for you. EOS 4 0 18 Awww I hope so. Just like some people say... there are plenty of fish in the sea. Thank you for the advice. It was really helpful. EOS 4 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] I wish you the very best.

EOS 5 0 3 I' m not happy with an ex friend who talks behind my back to my current friends. EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] ugh. There' s nothing worse than that. Have you confronted the ex friend? EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking. EOS 5 1 6 [Question] oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it? EOS 5 0 7 they' re still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander. EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s an option but I hope it doesn' t go that far again. Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend? EOS 5 0 9 no. i don' t want anything to do with her. if i find out my friends take her side they will be my ex friend too. EOS 5 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand that. You don' t want two people disrespecting you.. EOS 5 0 11 absolutely not. i have a strong constitution about myself and don' t allow to be disrespected by anyone. EOS 5 1 12 [Question] I hear that! What happened in court when you went? If you don' t mind me asking. EOS 5 0 13 i tried to get an order for her to stay away from me. the first judge passed it but the second judge said it wasn' t strong enough.. EOS 5 1 14 [Question] Sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can. Has she been in contact with you?

EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I completely understand that i feel that pain as well. are you there? EOS 0 0 6 oh I am sorry to hear that. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s ok there are plenty of other things that you can do with family during this time. EOS 0 0 8 Thats true that should be the holiday spirit and keep hope alive. EOS 0 1 9 [Question] exactly so what else do you have planned are you ready for the new year? EOS 0 0 10 Cook a good meal and spend time with my kids and spouse. Gifts wont be extravagant this year but I guess its the thought that counts. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes it' s the thought that counts and being blessed to be around love ones. EOS 0 0 12 Totally, thanks for that insight. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I myself is going to enjoy good food and enjoy hopefully some decent winter weather. your welcome. EOS 0 0 14 very nice, does it snow where you live?

EOS 0 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes in the US, thanksgiving was just with close family members.
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work. EOS 4 0 14 Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn' t even want me to help her, no she doesn' t work. EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family. EOS 4 0 16 Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] How long has it been since she moved in. EOS 4 0 18 A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you thought about a housewarming gift. EOS 4 0 20 Hmm, no I didn' t think about that, that may be a good idea. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So just a week and she is settling in. EOS 4 0 22 Yes, but the home came furnished and honestly, I didn' t think there was that much to do, but maybe I should get a gift, to break the ice. EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Friendship is important maybe she needs to hear from you. EOS 4 0 24 Yes, it is very important, I just felt if I called I would be bothering her:( EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style. EOS 4 0 26 That is possible, and it is a HUGE house, 4 stories. EOS 4 1 27 [Question] Have you tried to visit her and see if you can help. EOS 4 0 28 No, we are not seeing each other in person due to COVID. Do you think I should try calling or texting first? EOS 4 1 29 [Reflection of feelings] sometimes people get overwhelmed and need a friend to be there. EOS 4 0 30 Yes, they certainly do, darn COVID stops everything. EOS 4 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would be a great idea, especially with the holidays. EOS 4 0 32 Would a text be more appropriate vs. a phone call? What do you think? EOS 4 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah the virus has stopped a lot of people. EOS 4 0 34 I just feel so hurt and abandoned, like I don' t mean anything to her. EOS 4 1 35 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Why not text her 1st to break the ice. But maybe she is feeling like she is alone also.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 hi. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How are you? EOS 0 0 3 Ive been better. Stressful day. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] Ohh.. sorry to hear that. Would you mind sharing what is going on? EOS 0 0 5 Long story short, im a recovering alcoholic, 52 days sober, however my mental health has hit me with vengeance and am really struggling day to day. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You are getting out of alcoholism and feeling bad about it emotionally, is that right? EOS 0 0 7 i used alcohol as a self medication. It helped keep bad symtoms of ADHD away. I miss what alcohol used to do for me. EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I understand you pain and frustration. I have very close friend who has ADHD and trying to cope with it. EOS 0 0 9 Thankyou for allowing me some of your time. I would be so much better if my heart wasnt poorly. I could then be medicated properly. As of now i just have to live with it. Kinda sucks. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Are you seeing any counselor to address your challenge? EOS 0 0 11 I feel for your friend. EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you.. you know you are not alone in such journey... EOS 0 0 13 yes i have a therapist and currently on a 10 week post detox intensive plan to keep me focused. I have a good support network. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest you keep close touch with the support group and the therapist.. I see you are already in the right path.. EOS 0 0 15 I just wish to live outside my own sideways mind for 5 minutes. I need help with not becoming frustrated and angry with myself. Cant really see a way forward, am i destined to be absent minded for life? i know there must be a way somewhere to live normally. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] As you are already engaged with the professionals to help you.. I bet you will get the necessary help. Keep pursing these engagements... EOS 0 0 17 i will, i will not stop engaging for many years. EOS 0 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see you have the right attitude.. I strongly believe that you will be successful. EOS 0 0 19 Thankyou. Its nice to read that. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] you welcome.. anything else you want to talk about?
2 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you feeling today? EOS 2 0 1 Hi. I' m feeling okayish. EOS 2 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest. EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely. I recently broke up with my girlfriend. We had been together for more than 3 years. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] What happened that made you guys break up? EOS 2 0 5 She said that she simply wasn' t in love anymore, and that she didn' t have the same feelings she did at the beginning. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have also had this situation happen to me. Maybe it just wasn' t the right timing or she had other interests. EOS 2 0 7 She was so important for me. I feel so empty.... I Feel like I' m never finding anyone like her ever again, EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I' ve had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life. EOS 2 0 9 It' s easier said than done. At times I would rather maybe just dissapear. I have never had anyone else show romantic interest in me before. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] What is your age? EOS 2 0 11 I am 25 at the moment. EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] You still have your whole life ahead of you. Some people don' t find a partner until their 40' s or even 50' s. When I left my ex I found this guy that I truly fell in love with. He is still sulking in his living room. I told him that if he didn' t move one that he wouldnt get anywhere in life. I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what I would want him to do and I think thats what your girl would want you to do as well. EOS 2 0 13 I disagree with you regarding that maybe that is what she wants me to do. I don' t think she cares about me at the slightest anymore. I was a burden for her and will probably keep being it for any woman I meet. EOS 2 1 14 [Question] Did she give you any reasons to why she wasn' t in love anymore? EOS 2 0 15 I think she wasn' t feeling physically attracted to me anymore. EOS 2 1 16 [Question] Did you ever think she maybe possibly has been cheating? EOS 2 0 17 I could not say for sure. But I surely think she wouldn' t cheat on me. EOS 2 1 18 [Others] Has she ever tried to hide text messages, lock her phone, or tell you she is too busy to come over? EOS 2 0 19 Actually, In the past few months she has kinda freaked out everytime I tried to get her phone for her. As if she didn' t want me to see something. EOS 2 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Im sorry that this stressful for you. In my past, I have had exes do that to me. Most likely she was cheating on you and this was the reason for her motives.
4 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hai. EOS 4 0 1 Hai. My name is Tom and i really need your help. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok tell me. EOS 4 0 3 I am really sad and stressed up knowing that I am soon losing my job due to the effects of corona virus. For sure if I lose my job now I might go to depression because I have a family to take care of. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, don' t worry friend, EOS 4 0 5 Are there any ways you know that could help me convince my boss that that it is not the right time to cut down on manpower? EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] lot of people lose the job in this corona time. just explain you situation. EOS 4 0 7 Incase i lose the job, are there ways that can help me stay out of stress of losing the job? I am worried that losing a job may cause me a lot of harm since my bills depend on my current job. EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] definitely, you have to try to get the other work. don' t give up your confident, belive your self. EOS 4 0 9 I am really worried that getting another job during this season of corona is not easy, that is the stress that is almost killing me. Sure I do believe myself. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] you know any other self work? EOS 4 0 11 Not really. Do you happen to know any that can sustain me? EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i am not sure. what' s your occupation? EOS 4 0 13 Its ok my friend I believe that God will provide. I am an architect. EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] definitely, don' t worry.. oh, ok. EOS 4 0 15 Sure, Thanks a lot for your kind words. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok thank you friend bye.. god bless you..
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you feeling? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay. Thank you. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i' m okay too. EOS 0 0 4 Thats good. Do you have plans for the holidays? EOS 0 1 5 [Others] not really, i will probably just relax. what about you? EOS 0 0 6 Just hanging out at home with my husband and son. EOS 0 1 7 [Others] how' s your relationship with your family? EOS 0 0 8 It is pretty good. We all get along good. No issues. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] glad to hear so! EOS 0 0 10 How is your relationship with your family? EOS 0 1 11 [Others] it' s overly alright but i don' t really get along with my father. EOS 0 0 12 Oh i am sorry to hear that.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] don' t worry, it' s okay i am used to it. EOS 0 0 14 Has the Pandemic affected your work life at all?. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] not really i' ve always worked from home. what about you? EOS 0 0 16 Not me so much. Business was slow for quite a while because nobody was really working. But it affected my husband, because everytime anyone in our house got sick he had to leave work becase his work didnt allow anybody to be there if anybody in there household was sick.. So he missed quite a bit of work. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that must have been really terrible, i hope you all are coping with that. how did that make you feel? EOS 0 0 18 It was nerve wracking because you never knew how long he was going to be out of work for. his work changed their policy about when he could come back everytime he was out. EOS 0 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] just from talking to you i can see that it was very stressing for you. is he back to work yet?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 2 Feeling depressed as usual. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 4 Everything. Life. It' s awful. How many years do you really need to stop enjoying this place. Ya know what I mean. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand, but just to make sure I know what is going on fully, you are depressed in general and don' t know how to get through it.. EOS 3 0 6 I would say that is fairly accurate. Often times, I wish an asteroid would come down and begin the apocolypse.. Something to break up the routine. Don' t you find life utterly boring and repetitive?. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Just from these few messages, I can tell you are extremely upset about this.. I have had problems in the past with depression as well, I used to have severe anxiety as well.. EOS 3 0 8 Sorry to hear that. Anxiety and depression are dual bladed sword of badness. Really bad mixture. I never struggled too much with anxiety.. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It was tough. Have you thought about consulting a psychological professional to help with this issue? I did when I was going through my depression and it really helped..
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 hi. Could you please help?. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How are you tonight?. EOS 3 0 3 I am okay. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] How can I help you?
3 0 0 Hi, how' s your day going? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello. Im doing good. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 2 Not so good unfortunately. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why. Can you talknto me about it? EOS 3 0 4 Due to this pandemic, I am fearful for my job security and future in general. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how are you feeling. Its not that easy going through this pandemic. EOS 3 0 6 There is currently a lock down in my area. It seems like things are getting worse. My anxiety is high. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how are you feeling. Im kind of going in the same situation. But you have to keep calm. You have to look things at this way, maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home. I believe God put us in this situation to appreciate more our surroundings. EOS 3 0 8 I doubt it will get better, but thanks for the positive vibes. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you ever try to talk to your love one at home? Or maybe take time to communicate more with your friends? EOS 3 0 10 No, but I' ve been taking medication for my depression. Any suggestion on activities to help me past time? EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Well i dont know when this is going to end but if we let this isolation win the we are going to get worse. So I would recommend to share time with your love one and clear your mind and take out all the negative things away. Right now Im talking a lot with my brother and me and him never get along. So this is a huge step. EOS 3 0 12 That is great to hear. I wish I had someone I can talk to. Now I feel even more depressed. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Another thing i can recomend is try to read some books. That will help. I dont like reading but Im doing it and sometimes by doing it relaxed me and get me to another place. EOS 3 0 14 What kind of book genres do you recommend? EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, I love fictions and mystery. Right now I just finished" The Davinci Code". EOS 3 0 16 Oh, I will definitely check that one out. Any suggestion on tv shows? EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I dont want to sound like a Christian fanatic or something like that but the Bible helps too. Ever since this pandemic started I started read it and It helped me a lot.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 3 0 2 well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. My life is done now. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband. EOS 3 0 4 well, I cannot say it is a new start when I will be 90 in March. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Then you' ve definitely got a lot going for you if you' re 90! EOS 3 0 6 Had. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Why did he leave you? EOS 3 0 8 He wanted a younger woman. His new girlfriend is 63. He is 45. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that is more of his problem then. You deserve someone that' s better than leaving someone because of their age. EOS 3 0 10 I thought it would be nice to have a younger man when we got married. He eventually told me he just married me for my money, and was waiting for me to pass so he could inherit all of it. He said he got tired of waiting, so he moved on to someone else. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Personally, if that' s how he felt, then you' re better off. I know that doesn' t stop the hurt you' re feeling, but you are worth more than that. EOS 3 0 12 Now I am here alone. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being single does not mean you' re completely alone. There are a lot of resources to talk to someone and make friends. EOS 3 0 14 I am looking on Tinder for a new friend, but nobody wants someone that is 90. I never used it before, but someone told me about it. Considering I haven' t dated in 25 years. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could you try something like Facebook or Instagram to connect with old friends or acquaintances? EOS 3 0 16 What are those? I heard of them, but never used them. Most of my old friends are no longer around... EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Social networks online, you can connect with family or old coworkers. And post pictures and see what other people are doing with their lives.
3 0 0 Hello, is someone there? EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, my name is Jonathan. May I ask who I am speaking to today?
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Same old.. still trying to lose weight. Already on day 20 for fasting. did not lose a single pound. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight. What kind of methods have you been using? EOS 0 0 4 I tried keto diet for 6 months, didn' t work. So now on Fasting. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are really discouraged. EOS 0 0 6 I also go to gym 2 times a week. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow! You have been trying practically everything. You are really motivated. EOS 0 0 8 Yea, very discouraged... EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Losing weight can be difficult. I' ve struggled with that many times. Have you thought of consulting a dietician or a nutritionist to help? Maybe, they would offer some new suggestions.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Nice to meet you Jim, I am doing well. Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 3 I really appreciate your time Yes. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What is on your mind?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 hi. Could you please help?. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How are you tonight?. EOS 3 0 3 I am okay. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 3 0 5 I caught my gf texting another guy. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So from what I understand, you caught your significant other texting someone else.. EOS 3 0 7 yes right. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] What types of things was she texting him about? EOS 3 0 9 Asking about what he was doing later. What he likes to do for fun. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Just from the few messages we have sent, I can tell you are very anxious and upset about this situation.. EOS 3 0 11 yes for sure, i was so shocked and disappointed. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand this as I had issues with my ex fiancé texting other guys and cheating on me.. EOS 3 0 13 Oh no! thats horrible too. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how hard a situation like this is, but I know you can get through it! EOS 3 0 15 Thanks so much! I think I can too. Thanks for sharing with me. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to have a conversation with her about it? EOS 3 0 17 No I feel like she should come to me about it since she was caught. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] What if she doesn' t know you caught her? EOS 3 0 19 I saw her do it. She didn' t really say a whole lot, she just left right afterwards. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think it would definitely help to talk to her about it, it is never good to let situations like this build up without being talked about..
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am very sorry to hear that. What are you sad about? EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently? EOS 4 0 5 It is over permanently... EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah I guess, the relationship was a little toxic and she sometimes only used me for money. Maybe is it for the best now that I think about it. EOS 4 1 8 [Others] Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!!
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 The season has me down. No family around. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Are you finding time to do things you enjoy by yourself? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 3 trying to work and write but lack motivation. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are feeling some lethargy in this cold season, and feel as though you have no support from your family. EOS 0 0 5 I don' t talk to anyone. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any plans to spend Christmas with family or friends? That may help to break the cycle of feeling low? EOS 0 0 7 I live in a hotel currently. No family or friends around, especially with the virus. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What do you do for work? Are you able to get out of the hotel frequently? EOS 0 0 9 I am a writer. Witht he virus it is hard to meet anyone. i am only here until next week then I have to go to Virignia. My children r all over the country. EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I agree, it is hard to spend time with people at the moment. We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted. It would be good to have something positive to look forward to.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! What can I do to help? EOS 0 0 1 Hello, I' m not sure if there is any help? Without knowing when I can return to work, I will probably remain anxious about the unknown. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m glad to speak to you today. It sounds like you are having anxious thoughts. Can you tell me more?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 3 0 1 Hello. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, i feel like i am in depsression. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed?? EOS 3 0 5 My partner broke up with me impromptu. EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now. EOS 3 0 7 Exactly, that is my current situation. I feel like my entire life has been rearranged. How did you deal with them and specifically what was your coping mechanism? EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days. I slowly realised that i had put myself in slow motion and then slowly started to do things i used to do to maybe come out of it. EOS 3 0 9 True, what ways would you suggest i use to approach my situation and get out of this state? It is very pathetic really when you think of it, halting all your life activities and plans just because a relationship ended. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well i had a close friend that i was able to vent to and help me see what was important. Do you have anyone close in your life you could talk to for guidance? EOS 3 0 11 Close friends can really be helpful in such situations. Yes, i do have a close friend even though i am very poor when it comes to opening up. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see what you mean about pathetic lol. But rather than see yourself as pathetic in a negative, use that defiance to push yourself back out into the world. Start slowly with opening up, maybe even tell your friend you intent and ask them to be patient as you learn to better express your inner feelings. EOS 3 0 13 Yes, i should do that because at the end of it all i still have myself to take care of. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think youre already on the right track. I just know you can get back to you! EOS 3 0 15 Opening up is a skill that i could do better at because i have never been the open type. But with a little practice i could get better at it. I have to get better no matter what. Are there other tactics you can share with me with regards to my current situation? EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are resources online that perhaps you could look into to help with expressing yourself. EOS 3 0 17 Is there any particular resource you can refer me to? EOS 3 1 18 [Others] Yes just a moment.
1 0 0 Hello I am having pro\ blems with a friend. EOS 1 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so so sorry to hear that. What has been going on? EOS 1 0 2 Sometimes she is very friendly, but sometimes she is super rude. In a way that is so rude that it has never happened before by someone who I consider a friend. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh wow, it sounds like shes not a very good frined. EOS 1 0 4 As nice as she is, every once in a while show will be equally nasty. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Have you tried talking to her about it? EOS 1 0 6 Super snarky comments. Yes I have tried. But it still continues. EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried seperating from her? EOS 1 0 8 I can' t she is a colleague. So unless I want to get a new job. but she is super helpful and nice 99 percent of the time. And when I have spoken with her, the last time I was very clear with her that it was inappropriate, and it hasn' t been happening as often, but the whole situation is still very hurtful. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s so hurtful. Do others feel the same as you? EOS 1 0 10 Yes, I have heard these complaints from one other person. Do you have any ideas or other suggestions for me. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you can try talking to yoru manager next time it happens? It is hard but you can only really control yourself, so you need to try to emotionally distance yourself from when she is terrible. You seem like a good persn.
0 0 0 hi there. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m surviving. Today is better than yesterday was. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. What is bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I' ve been out of work since Covid closed down the live event industry in March. the unemployment system still hasn' t processed any of my claims, and I have been surviving off of what I can make driving for doordash, which hasn' t been a lot. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough. The unemployment system has been very slow during COVID, so I completely understand your frustration and worry. I am glad to hear that you are doing door dash, even if you aren' t making a lot that is still something! EOS 0 0 6 ugh, yeah... I drive a really old beat up car though, so I can' t really go out after dark, and I' m worried I' m driving it too much and it' s going to break down. I wish mturk paid more, or one of the jobs I' ve applied for would hire me to do something form home. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I also wish mturk paid more, I feel like it takes a lot of time for not that much money. Do you have a roommate, friend, or family member' s car you could possibly borrow instead of using your own? EOS 0 0 8 No, I live with housemates but they all don' t drive. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. Are you still looking for and applying for jobs? EOS 0 0 10 im sorry im late. I am still applying, but only for what I can do from home, and I worry i am underqualified. are you still there? EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Yes I am still here. When I started working from home I did a lot of research on different types of jobs that I could do from home. There are a lot of work options that are not necessarily well known, in my opinion, for online work. EOS 0 0 12 Before this my work was primarily in concert audio, with a side hustle of carpentry. I' ve been playing with these survey sites, and applying for a lot of call center jobs that don' t seem interested in me. If you have any suggestions I' m open to them! EOS 0 1 13 [Others] If you worked in audio I know that some places, like Upwork and ACX( which does some audiobook work) are looking for audio editing. I am sure that other places are looking for audio editing. I think Fiverr may also be a good place to advertise audio work. I also have an Etsy and Ebay shop, you could possibly sell some of your carpentry work on there if that is possible. Ebay is free to list and Etsy has a small listing fee.
3 0 0 hello. anyone there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with today? EOS 3 0 2 am not fine. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What is it that is making you feel this way? EOS 3 0 4 i was cheated on severally, and it resulted me to end the relationship. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you had to deal with a partner recently cheating and a breakup, is this right? EOS 3 0 6 yes thats it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this has been stressful for you and you are trying to figure out how to move on from this. EOS 3 0 8 exactly, i can tend to focus because i have given so much time and affection, i never thought i would be called the fool after everything i did. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is incredibly difficult to get something like this off your mind and it seems like you are trying your best to move forward with your life. EOS 3 0 10 i want to move on but i dont know how, i tried to but i just cant. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I have been through this, I learned how to keep myself busy and do things that I enjoy to occupy my mind and let time heal those wounds. EOS 3 0 12 i think you right, maybe i should renew my netflix sub, since i find great interest in movies so as to get some positive vibes and think less of this whole situation. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Science shows that during a breakup sometimes you romanticize the relationship and view it as better than it actually was and missing something that wasn' t as good as you thought. EOS 3 0 14 yh thats true. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] My suggestion is to focus on new hobbies, spend time with friends and family when possible, if you have work you can do in the mean time, if you like to exercise or go outside, all of this is a helpful tool. EOS 3 0 16 this is really helpful, i really do appreciate this suggestions. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] Don' t be afraid to express your feelings and confide in others about your emotions and mental health. It is still a loss and something you should feel comfortable grieving. EOS 3 0 18 Thanks alot, i feel very relieved talking to you alone, i feel like something negative just left me, i know i will be a better person from this day onward. EOS 3 1 19 [Others] I am glad this was helpful for you and hope you will seek further advice if you feel the need to discuss with someone unbiased. EOS 3 0 20 thanks, you are a life saver. gotta go now. EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay hope all is well and I can provide resources if needed for you.
3 0 0 hi there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! what seems to be bothering you today? EOS 3 0 2 currently, i am living in a house with my brother, which i co own and can not afford to move out.. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Is living with your brother a bad thing? What specifically is making you upset? EOS 3 0 4 yes it is. he acts like a azz most of the time. he dosent care about anyone but himself. just like his fiancé. he throws away the bills and expects me to pay to keep the utilities on when they are about to be disconnected. then tells me i dont contribute to the house.. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems like he would be a very difficult person to live with. And that is hard for you obviously. I' m thinking your upset because you can' t leave so you' re stuck. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 6 yes, felling very stuck.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s completely normal to feel that way. I' m sure you' re handling the situation as best as you can. What have you done to try and help the situation?
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing.
4 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling really sad and lonely right now. My boyfriend and I broke up and it was me who wanted it but now I regret breaking up and he doesn' t want me back. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, I can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it' s too late. EOS 4 0 3 That is exactly it. I broke up with him because I liked another person but then quickly realized that I made a mistake and it' s too late. I want him back should I start calling and going to his house to beg? EOS 4 1 4 [Question] nobody knows him better than you do, right now I do not think he is in a good place either since it wasn' t his choice to end it, how do you think he would react if you started pressuring him?.
4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out. EOS 4 0 6 I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night? EOS 4 0 8 I can' t sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it' s typically late afternoon. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds like you are doing the very best you can under difficult circumstances. you should feel very proud about that. EOS 4 0 10 thank you. i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] it sounds to me that your sleep issue is really weighing on your mind. you may be setting yourself up for sleep issues by thinking about this so much. is that possible? EOS 4 0 12 yes it may be. i' m not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you' re under a lot of pressure. it' s only natural that you would feel overwhelmed. dont be hard on yourself. you' re doing the best you can.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that? EOS 0 0 21 being on the board gives me perks. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit? EOS 0 0 23 yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there' s an element of mutual manipulation. EOS 0 0 25 yes. EOS 0 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are definitely not the only person to feel this way!

1 0 0 hi there. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hi! Hope you are doing well. How can I help you today? EOS 1 0 2 I am having such a hard time falling asleep at night.... I toss and turn and cannot shut my mind off. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep. Hope I get it right? EOS 1 0 4 yes that' s right. my mind just races thinking about problems it seems. I am irritable and frustrated. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Is there a specific thing or task which is bothering you for long? EOS 1 0 6 I worry about my daughter, she has addictions. I never know if she is okay or not, she doesn' t call me very often and is hard to get a hold of. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It must be a tough time for you and is a enough reason to not getting good sleep. despite of it you should need a complete rest.
3 1 0 [Question] Good evening! What can I help you with tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I am dealing with pandemic depression. We are completely isolated. Can' t see friends, family, hug grandkids... EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] That is extremely understandable. The pandemic is an event no one was prepared for, and it has cause unforseen upheavals.. That is a tough situation, being isolated physically from those that you love. I' m sorry you' re going through that. EOS 3 0 3 It' s been going on for months with no end in sight. EOS 3 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are you at least able to maintain contact through text and video chats?. EOS 3 0 5 How do you deal with it? Yes, some video chats, but not the same. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, I make sure I continue to maintain my relationships as well as possible through the avenues I have available. It is definitely not the same, but it' s what we have at the moment. Personally, I try to maintain a routine. First hour after I wake up is coffee time, coffee and social media scroll time.
0 1 0 [Question] hello how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hello I am taking a break from my studies to talk. I am fine thanks. Hope you are doing well also. I am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines. EOS 0 1 2 [Self-disclosure] i am fine thanks for asking. EOS 0 0 3 two exams and two assignments due at the end of this and next month. that' s good. EOS 0 1 4 [Others] Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful. EOS 0 0 5 yeah I have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it' s online and basically I do things on my own time.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you taking a lot of courses? EOS 0 0 7 2 courses. but I am pretty much using full time capacity on them. devoting full - time I mean. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] do you like doing school online better than in person? EOS 0 0 9 Have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good the more time you have to devote the better! EOS 0 0 11 I have done both methods. I definitely prefer in - school studies.. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel it is more stressful online? EOS 0 0 13 I am just disappointed that I have been slacking off and procrastinating. no it' s just that it' s a different avenue. I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. I think it' s because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow.. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after. EOS 0 0 15 yeah I take breaks in between.. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Yea this pandemic has me not as motivated to. EOS 0 0 17 But sometimes a lot more breaks or longer breaks than intended or I should. yeah definitely. Sorry to hear that.. It' s like everyday is the same and I can' t go out to refresh my mind or have a change of pace such as going to the gym or go out for a run. whereas before the pandemic, I can switch gears that way and come back refreshed. like going out to the movies and coming back with renewed enthusiasm. EOS 0 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Yea i have been missing the gym myself. Now i lookup youtube videos of workouts and do them, and it really helps to get me going in the day. Do you ever listen to music while you are trying to get work done? When i do that it tends to help time go faster and i get more done. EOS 0 0 19 I see. Yeah it' s good to have a routine and good way to resume life as usual.. sometimes I listen to music but I find it hard to read and absorb and listen to music. But I do listen to music sometimes when I am on assignments.. I also tend to drink coffee to focus my mind better. It does help. And I know I can pass the courses and on time but just that I am disappointed at my performance and work ethics as I know I have done much better before. So I am missing that sense of urgency, conscientiousness, and maturity., EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe find a nice meditation song to help relax you, i find when i am doing something finding a song with no words is better so i am able to concentrate. EOS 0 0 21 I see. That' s a good idea. I was also thinking I should have a regular workout routine at home again because I used to work out much more daily, even at home.. EOS 0 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are a very smart person and are able to acknowledge when you need to work harder on something. Don' t be to hard on yourself this pandemic is affecting everyone. EOS 0 0 23 working out does help me focus and be productive.. Thank you and I do agree with you on the pandemic. But this is a part of my mistake too but I think coming away from our conversation, I am more optimistic now having talked to someone about it.. EOS 0 1 24 [Self-disclosure] Yes i would imagine that would help to, i found that before i started working out at home i was beginning to feel lazy and not getting anything done, but that has all changed now.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 3 0 2 well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. My life is done now. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband. EOS 3 0 4 well, I cannot say it is a new start when I will be 90 in March. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Then you' ve definitely got a lot going for you if you' re 90! EOS 3 0 6 Had. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Why did he leave you? EOS 3 0 8 He wanted a younger woman. His new girlfriend is 63. He is 45. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that is more of his problem then. You deserve someone that' s better than leaving someone because of their age. EOS 3 0 10 I thought it would be nice to have a younger man when we got married. He eventually told me he just married me for my money, and was waiting for me to pass so he could inherit all of it. He said he got tired of waiting, so he moved on to someone else. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Personally, if that' s how he felt, then you' re better off. I know that doesn' t stop the hurt you' re feeling, but you are worth more than that.

EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you. EOS 4 0 3 I think that my boyfriend is cheating on me again!!! EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Are you saying that he has cheated on you before? That does not sound very promising. EOS 4 0 5 He has but it was a long time ago and was before we had a talk about exclusivity in our relationship but it still hurt. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Have you considered getting some sort of couples counselling? Or do you just think that he is never going to change?
0 0 0 Hello? Is anyone there? Is anyone there. HELLO? no one is supporting me here..:: twiddles thumbs:: the instructions for the support seeker are incorrect as there is no button that has shown for" the partner' s reasons".. the supporter did not respond.

EOS 0 0 2 Hi. i wasn' t sure anyone was there. i left my job about three months after 8 years.. haven' t found another one.. trying to find one has been challenging. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Just be clear, you' re worried about finding a new job? EOS 0 0 4 well, yeah. in the middle of a pandemic, and being in a new town. all of that has been really hard. and stressful.

EOS 0 0 6 yeah... i don' t know... i' m not sleeping well because i' m so worried. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I could imagine that being a constant worry. I understand how you may feel. EOS 0 0 8 thanks for trying to understand. it just seems pretty hopeless. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] No problem. I am encountering a similar situation, looking for a well suited job. Have you tried looking in to new career fields that have always interested you? EOS 0 0 10 Yeah, I am looking in a variety of fields. not much out there that is remote. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are a lot of jobs in technology where the only requirement is learning a few courses, such as programming. EOS 0 0 12 that would be cool. i really enjoy tech. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It would be nice to work in a field that you also enjoy!

How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability. EOS 3 0 21 i applied for disability but didn' t get it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself. EOS 3 0 23 yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn' t matter. EOS 3 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Social Security stopped you. Why?
3 0 0 hi there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! what seems to be bothering you today? EOS 3 0 2 currently, i am living in a house with my brother, which i co own and can not afford to move out.. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Is living with your brother a bad thing? What specifically is making you upset? EOS 3 0 4 yes it is. he acts like a azz most of the time. he dosent care about anyone but himself. just like his fiancé. he throws away the bills and expects me to pay to keep the utilities on when they are about to be disconnected. then tells me i dont contribute to the house.. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems like he would be a very difficult person to live with. And that is hard for you obviously. I' m thinking your upset because you can' t leave so you' re stuck. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 6 yes, felling very stuck.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s completely normal to feel that way. I' m sure you' re handling the situation as best as you can. What have you done to try and help the situation? EOS 3 0 8 trying to, looking for every way possible to make money and save it up and move out. really dont want to have to partition the property as its the house we grew up in.. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I would feel the same way if that' s a house I grew up in. I' m so sorry! EOS 3 0 10 i tried to talk to him, in his mind its all my fault he cant pay the bills he had before i moved in. i had been living in california for the last few years, but came back with corona virus on the rise there.. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If he' s in a certain mindset, it would be hard to change that. Do you have people to talk to about this? It sounds like a lot to handle. EOS 3 0 12 right? and his fiancé is the same way, they are both alcoholics and spend most of their income on their habits. its all i can do right now to keep food in the house, let alone running water.. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think it would be good for you to talk to someone and get help. Right now, all you can do is keep chugging along and trying your best to stay afloat. EOS 3 0 14 i have a couple of friends that i have talked to about it, but it just seems like i am screaming at a brick wall and nothing changes.. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest talking to a therapist if your insurance can handle that! Talking with them can help you figure out what you should do.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Not so great - found out i' m losing my job in january. EOS 2 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] On no I am sorry to hear that! I know that must be tough. EOS 2 0 3 Yes I' m not even sure what steps to take right now. EOS 2 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea that can be difficult. Have you started looking for something else? EOS 2 0 5 Not yet, I' m not even sure where to begin. I have not looked for a job in 20 years. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way. EOS 2 0 7 I' ve tried calling the unemployment office to get some ideas but they do not answer their phones. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Or you could look for some side jobs like cleaning or organizing things until you find something more permanent. EOS 2 0 9 Yeah, i' m kinda old for that - LOL!!! My back would not hold up to that - and my salary wouldn' t be comparable. EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea it seems to be hard to get up with a lot of places at this time. Persistent is the key. EOS 2 0 11 Well I hear that their offices are closed and you have to do everything online - so not sure if they can even help me. EOS 2 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes i understand right now is a very bad time to find anything with so many places closed. Do you have any family or friends to reach out to for help if needed? EOS 2 0 13 I think I might be able to call my friend, but she' s in another state. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you gave any thought to babysitting or are there any crafts you are good at making that maybe you could try to sell? EOS 2 0 15 That would not be enough money. I would not be able to pay my bills. EOS 2 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand your concern there but it could help pay some as to help you not to get to far behind until you find something.

EOS 6 0 4 Not being able to find a job after graduation. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand how you are feeling i had the same problem after i graduated. EOS 6 0 6 okay. EOS 6 1 7 [Question] have you put in job applications everywhere. EOS 6 0 8 Yes I did, and quite a lot but I think because of the pandemic they are not hiring that much. EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] With this pandemic going on i know it is even more harder to get a job. EOS 6 0 10 yes. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you are right. Have you looked on the internet such as indeed? EOS 6 0 12 I' ve tried LinkedIn they have many companies hiring. maybe my CV is just bad. EOS 6 1 13 [Question] yes they do i am familiar with that. how is your resume looking? EOS 6 0 14 I think I could improve it. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you talked to someone in your family and see if they could help you with your resume to improve it. EOS 6 0 16 I' ve asked some friends, I think a friend will help me out when he' s not busy. EOS 6 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient. EOS 6 0 18 Yes I know. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried to go to place and talk to a hiring boss about a job? EOS 6 0 20 It' s hard with this virus to go anywhere pretty much. EOS 6 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] yes i can understand that. EOS 6 0 22 Worst time to graduate. Haven' t even got the graduation ceremony lol. EOS 6 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] all you can honestly really do right now is to try to improve your resume and see if that helps any and just keep searching for jobs and putting in applications and i know you will get a call from a job soon. yes it has been a bad year for anything to happen. EOS 6 0 24 Yea that' s what I am thinking of doing. EOS 6 1 25 [Others] good thing is you graduated and congrats on that. EOS 6 0 26 yes at least I graduated. haha. thank you.

0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious?

0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how is your day? EOS 0 0 1 Not good. I was told today that my contract is not being renewed once it ends this month. I am very anxious about finding another job during pandemic. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see, It' s been a difficult year for all of us. But I think it would be possible to negotiate. EOS 0 0 3 But I tried negotiating. They are down - sizing the entire sales department. What else can I do? EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Hmmm, I can see that this is stressful for you. Did you already search for a new job? EOS 0 0 5 Yes I am preparing my resume but job vacancies are few and far between. I am worried about my next job. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Okay then, It' s good that you already started. But first of all stop being panicked. EOS 0 0 7 Ok. Do you have any ideas for sales positions? EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Search online and locally, get help from your friends and I assure you if you try hard enough you will suceed. EOS 0 0 9 I will. How can I get help from friends? Only very few are in sales field. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] And remember, what are we if we stop fighting? Your friends can support you emotionally at least and maybe they know a person that could help you. EOS 0 0 11 I agree. I should never give up. But due to financial commitments, I am somewhat afraid of failing. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Life is full of surprises, but we should get advantage of bad situations. It' s totally fine to be afraid, but also at the same time you should try harder to reach your goal.

We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress.

What was the fight over?

3 0 0 I' m so depressed, I just got layed off. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I am sorry to hear that, did you apply for unemployment benefit? That at least can help you financially until you get a new job. EOS 3 0 2 Yes, it will take weeks and the holidays are just around the corner. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sucks it happens so close to the holidays. I understand it' s hard to accept but I' d recommend talking with someone close to you like a friend and family member. EOS 3 0 4 I know, with all the other crap going on now everyone else has their own problems they don' t want to hear mine. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure someone will be there for you, they know you need them the most right now. If you don' t feel comfortable talking to them, you can seek online therapist. There are a lot of free service for mental car. EOS 3 0 6 They' re busy with other people' s problems. I' ll deal with it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It' s not gonna be easy, but at the same time not impossible. Try looking at it a different way. You can use this time to train your skills or do things that you' ve wanted to but didn' t have the time. EOS 3 0 8 I wanted to travel but that' s not a good idea right now. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] You can still travel domestically or just around your city. I like taking a walk in the park or wandering downtown to clear my mind. EOS 3 0 10 I live in a small town and were are suppose to self quarantine unless we have to leave the house for work or go to the store. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] that really sucks. Do you have a garden at home? In the mean time, try following youtube or other channels to work out, it helps you distract from current issue and also makes you healthier. A healthy body is needed for a healthy mind. EOS 3 0 12 I did, everything is gone now.. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] what have you been doing lately? EOS 3 0 14 I do like to cook. I' ll probable do more of that now. EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s a great idea, cooking and doing crafts can be helpful for you. Instead of complaining with others, you can just invite them to join cooking with you, that way you can have companion. EOS 3 0 16 That is a good idea but nobody is suppose to go to other peoples houses. EOS 3 1 17 [Self-disclosure] you can do video chat while cooking. I do virtual happy hour with my friends right now too. EOS 3 0 18 I think I may start making my own beer. Two birds one stone. EOS 3 1 19 [Others] haha good idea.
3 1 0 [Question] Good afternoon how may I help you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello there. I' m suffering with increased depression and I' m not quite clear why. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately? EOS 3 0 3 No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that' s the same for everyone. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression?
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am very sorry to hear that. What are you sad about? EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently? EOS 4 0 5 It is over permanently... EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah I guess, the relationship was a little toxic and she sometimes only used me for money. Maybe is it for the best now that I think about it. EOS 4 1 8 [Others] Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!! EOS 4 0 9 Yeah I just miss having someone there for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] All you need now is to give yourself some TLC.. treat yourself to something nice and go easy on yourself. EOS 4 0 11 What is TLC. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] There will be someone else. I never thought I' d find anyone else but I did and we' ve been together ten years ago now! Tender Loving Care:) Means be good to yourself. EOS 4 0 13 Ok yeah your story is very inspirational to me. Maybe this was needed in order to find the right person. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anything you can do to distract yourself right now? Plan a holiday or take a night class or something?
3 1 0 [Question] Good afternoon how may I help you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello there. I' m suffering with increased depression and I' m not quite clear why. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately? EOS 3 0 3 No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that' s the same for everyone. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression? EOS 3 0 5 I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I' ve always had a low mood but now I' m anxious that it will continue to get worse. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again? EOS 3 0 7 Since lockdown haven' t spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don' t want this to get any worse. What if she isn' t available?. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It wouldn' t hurt to try and reach out. If she isn' t available, there are other services. EOS 3 0 9 What like support groups etc? I' m also sure this isn' t just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It' s weird and a little concerning to be honest. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there how can be of help? EOS 3 0 2 I am suffering from low mood and general depression. I don' t know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down( obviously) and there doesn' t appear to be any real reason behind it. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue? EOS 3 0 4 I felt this way for a while actually isn' t a recent change it' s been building slowly over time. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same? EOS 3 0 6 I think I know what you mean. It' s getting worse. I feel very down. EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse. EOS 3 0 8 Yeah. I worry that I' ll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. I' m really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Firstly, you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with depression and it' s good that you have reached out for help for this. EOS 3 0 10 Any suggestions on what to do about it? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many reasons people have depression. It is a recognised medical condition and the good news is that there is help out there. The first step is recognising the problem. EOS 3 0 12 Ok well there is definitely a problem. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Have you spoken to friends and family about this? do they know how much you are struggling with it at the moment? EOS 3 0 14 not really I don' t want to bother other people with my problems. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. I think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help. EOS 3 0 16 Yeah maybe. I suppose nobody really understands but I could at least speak to them about it. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] everyone has problems and it is good to talk about them because a problem shared is a problem halved. It doesn' t mean the problems will go away but it might help you understand them and then be able to deal with them better. EOS 3 0 18 I don' t want to feel like this anymore. I' m willing to at least give it a go. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also think that it will be worse to get in touch with your doctor or a medical professional. these people are trained to deal with problems like yours and will be able to offer effective Solutions from a medical perspective. EOS 3 0 20 I haven' t spoken to a doctor about this before to be clear I don' t want any medication. EOS 3 1 21 [Question] are you worried that speaking to a doctor will lead to you being given medication, and you don' t want this? EOS 3 0 22 yes that' s right I don' t want to take any pills or anything like that. EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know that some forms of depression are caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain and medication in these cases can help. Also psychologists can support with mental health which means that this would not be a rude day involves any medication at all potentially. EOS 3 0 24 what do you mean be a rude day. EOS 3 1 25 [Others] apologies this was a typo by autocorrect. I meant to say that this would not be a route that involves any medication at all potentially.
4 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello, How are you today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m really depressed. My fiance left me yesterday. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it? EOS 4 0 3 Yes, I think that might make me feel better. I really have no one to talk to because my family and friends didn' t like him so they think this is for the best. EOS 4 1 4 [Greeting] Ok. I am happy to listen.. EOS 4 0 5 I just don' t understand why someone would pretend to be happy for a year and then decide they were lying and leave. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Seems like you feel your partner betrayed you, does that sound right?. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I feel very betrayed.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is understandable. I know how you feel, may I suggest taking a few minutes to clear your head, and making a plan to talk with your friends and parents about how you feel? EOS 4 0 9 They think I should just get over it because they didn' t like him so they think I shouldn' t like him either. They' re making things worse for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] Oh I' m so sorry, sometimes family and friends don' t think about your feelings. When did this happen? EOS 4 0 11 He left yesterday. I had no warning. He just packed up all his stuff and said he didn' t want to marry me and the last year has been a lie. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Dang. he seems very selfish. But I understand how up setting it must have felt. My first husband left me without warning. EOS 4 0 13 I' m sorry to hear that. How long did it take you to feel better? EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Awhile. it started to feel a little bit better after I kept telling myself it was about him and not about me, then I started feeling a bit better. But it will take time, the old say is correct, good days and bad days..

EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently? EOS 4 0 5 It is over permanently... EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah I guess, the relationship was a little toxic and she sometimes only used me for money. Maybe is it for the best now that I think about it. EOS 4 1 8 [Others] Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!! EOS 4 0 9 Yeah I just miss having someone there for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] All you need now is to give yourself some TLC.. treat yourself to something nice and go easy on yourself. EOS 4 0 11 What is TLC. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] There will be someone else. I never thought I' d find anyone else but I did and we' ve been together ten years ago now! Tender Loving Care:) Means be good to yourself. EOS 4 0 13 Ok yeah your story is very inspirational to me. Maybe this was needed in order to find the right person. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anything you can do to distract yourself right now? Plan a holiday or take a night class or something? EOS 4 0 15 I am now doing mturk to get my mind off of it to make some extra money. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Save up what you make and buy yourself something nice? EOS 4 0 17 yeah the only problem is I am barely getting any money from this. Do you have any tips onto how I can make more money/ EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There is some very lucrative stuff out there:). Take what we are doing right now for instance. EOS 4 0 19 I mean 15 minutes for 2$ doesn' t seem very lucrative. but I guess it ads up. EOS 4 1 20 [Question] beats flipping burgers;). So, what are you going to do to get yourself back onto the dating market?
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work. EOS 4 0 14 Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn' t even want me to help her, no she doesn' t work. EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family. EOS 4 0 16 Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] How long has it been since she moved in. EOS 4 0 18 A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you thought about a housewarming gift. EOS 4 0 20 Hmm, no I didn' t think about that, that may be a good idea. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So just a week and she is settling in. EOS 4 0 22 Yes, but the home came furnished and honestly, I didn' t think there was that much to do, but maybe I should get a gift, to break the ice. EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Friendship is important maybe she needs to hear from you. EOS 4 0 24 Yes, it is very important, I just felt if I called I would be bothering her:( EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style. EOS 4 0 26 That is possible, and it is a HUGE house, 4 stories. EOS 4 1 27 [Question] Have you tried to visit her and see if you can help. EOS 4 0 28 No, we are not seeing each other in person due to COVID. Do you think I should try calling or texting first? EOS 4 1 29 [Reflection of feelings] sometimes people get overwhelmed and need a friend to be there. EOS 4 0 30 Yes, they certainly do, darn COVID stops everything. EOS 4 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would be a great idea, especially with the holidays. EOS 4 0 32 Would a text be more appropriate vs. a phone call? What do you think? EOS 4 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah the virus has stopped a lot of people. EOS 4 0 34 I just feel so hurt and abandoned, like I don' t mean anything to her. EOS 4 1 35 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Why not text her 1st to break the ice. But maybe she is feeling like she is alone also. EOS 4 0 36 Well, I think I will try that, I mean, it' s not that intrusive. I hope she' s not feeling alone, I hope she doesn' t think I' m abandoning her! EOS 4 1 37 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The virus is stopping people but we can find away. Does she have other family.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 2 Feeling depressed as usual. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 4 Everything. Life. It' s awful. How many years do you really need to stop enjoying this place. Ya know what I mean. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand, but just to make sure I know what is going on fully, you are depressed in general and don' t know how to get through it.. EOS 3 0 6 I would say that is fairly accurate. Often times, I wish an asteroid would come down and begin the apocolypse.. Something to break up the routine. Don' t you find life utterly boring and repetitive?. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Just from these few messages, I can tell you are extremely upset about this.. I have had problems in the past with depression as well, I used to have severe anxiety as well.. EOS 3 0 8 Sorry to hear that. Anxiety and depression are dual bladed sword of badness. Really bad mixture. I never struggled too much with anxiety.. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It was tough. Have you thought about consulting a psychological professional to help with this issue? I did when I was going through my depression and it really helped.. EOS 3 0 10 NO! I would never do that. I' m already on anti depressants. That didn' t help at all.. I just don' t understand why people like life enough to make more people! It is madness! EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I didn' t like the meds that they gave me either, however I felt that talking to someone helped me a great deal..
1 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 1 0 1 I am just a little angry. My mother and I had another blow - up. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother? EOS 1 0 3 It is why I am angry. This occurs at least every other day. I say something harmless and she thinks I am saying it in a way that is rude or something. EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you can figure out a way to communicate better. EOS 1 0 5 I do not know for sure where to start. If I try to tell her that is not what I mean it is like she doesn' t understand? EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to feel misunderstood. EOS 1 0 7 For example today I was just saying I like the food she had cooked us for supper. She took that to mean I never liked the food she made before. She says I do not appreciate her and I should be grateful to have her. EOS 1 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing your best to be nice but it isn' t getting through. EOS 1 0 9 Maybe it was the way she was brought up that she is so sensitive. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everybody has stuff from their past that affects them.
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state. EOS 0 0 6 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well. EOS 0 0 8 Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing( which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all. I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out. EOS 0 0 10 What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job: it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. Working there would be ministry, not typical work. And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, that' s a big deal. i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it. EOS 0 0 12 Thank you. I believe there are three things in my favor: I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current( related) job fifteen years ago. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] even by working there, you will surely meet new friends. do you know many people from the church? EOS 0 0 14 We worked together for almost 13 years before she retired, but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer/ work partner? I know a few of the higher ups from the area churches, and a handful of families. I know half the core staff I would be working with daily and think of them as extended family.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you just have to be patient and don' t push it too hard so that you won' t look desperate. EOS 0 0 16 The benefits are nice, also, such as staff are provided meals prepared by the banquet chef and his team when at work. And though everyone has a role, the office staff support each other well and work as a team. EOS 0 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, banquet at work. that is a wonderland stuff.
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you feeling?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 0 0 1 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am doing great, how about you?
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, what brings you to seek support, today? EOS 4 0 1 I am having ongoing depression. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin? EOS 4 0 3 I have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It first began a couple of weeks ago. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I am sad and anxious about the coronavirus. I miss seeing my friends and family. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you must really care about your friends and family, and this awful pandemic is prevent your from seeing them. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, definitely. I hope the pandemic will end. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all? EOS 4 0 9 I haven' t thought about dying at all. I take medication each day for my depression, but there are times when I still feel sad. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay, thanks for sharing that personal information. I only ask because thoughts of suicide are normal and anxiety and depression increase the chances of suicide. EOS 4 0 11 You' re welcome. I understand, but I am not suicidal. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] What would you like to talk about, then? We could talk about the problem more, or if you feel like it is defined, we could talk about solutions, or not talk about solutions at all. What would make you feel better? EOS 4 0 13 I would like to talk about solutions since I feel like the problem is defined. EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I know what it is like to be depressed. I also take medication for this. For solutions, studies show that working out and exercising can help depression. Have you considered this? EOS 4 0 15 Yes, I enjoy taking walks and doing a cardio workout at home. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] That' s great! What ways do you think you could communicate more with your family? EOS 4 0 17 I could communicate more with my family by calling them on the phone, texting, emailing, or talking to them on Zoom. EOS 4 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You listed a lot of good solutions such as zoom and texting. Do you think doing that would make you feel less depressed? EOS 4 0 19 Yes, I think that Zoom and texting would make me feel less depressed. EOS 4 1 20 [Others] Well, let me ask you this. I noticed that you had many solutions off - hand that you could tell me, and you also said it could help you with your depression. May I ask what is keeping you from using these methods? EOS 4 0 21 Wanting to stay in bed is keeping me from using these methods. EOS 4 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh, I completely understand. Depression has that effect. But maybe you can talk to your loved ones while in bed? How do you feel about that? EOS 4 0 23 I feel okay about that. EOS 4 1 24 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, it' s worth a try, right! EOS 4 0 25 Yes, it is worth a try. Thank you for all of your help! EOS 4 1 26 [Greeting] Thank you for allowing us to complete this task as well. I know depression can cause us to lose motivation, so I really appreciate it. I hope you feel better. EOS 4 0 27 Thank you. EOS 4 1 28 [Greeting] You are welcome. Goodbye.
3 0 0 Hello, I' ve been really depressed lately and feel like there isn' t anything I can do to break this feeling. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened? EOS 3 0 2 November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS( its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct?
3 0 0 Hi, how' s your day going? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello. Im doing good. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 2 Not so good unfortunately. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why. Can you talknto me about it? EOS 3 0 4 Due to this pandemic, I am fearful for my job security and future in general. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how are you feeling. Its not that easy going through this pandemic. EOS 3 0 6 There is currently a lock down in my area. It seems like things are getting worse. My anxiety is high. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how are you feeling. Im kind of going in the same situation. But you have to keep calm. You have to look things at this way, maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home. I believe God put us in this situation to appreciate more our surroundings. EOS 3 0 8 I doubt it will get better, but thanks for the positive vibes. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you ever try to talk to your love one at home? Or maybe take time to communicate more with your friends?

I know break ups can be very hard.. EOS 4 0 3 yeah. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel you are depressed about it? Were you together a long time?

They are never easy. EOS 4 0 7 what should i do now? EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Well, if the break up is still fresh, it will take some time before you start feeling yourself again. Breaking up with someone can be as devastating as a death. Because you mourn the loss of the person. What do you think you could do to help yourself feel better? EOS 4 0 9 that is very true. what i need right now is to distract my mind and think about something else. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] What kind of hobbies do you have? Or are you involved in sports or any type of other activities that you enjoy?

1 0 0 My friend borrowed money from me but she won' t return it now. EOS 1 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry about that. It is always hard when we trust someone and they let us down. is that waht you are feeling? Disappointment in your friend? EOS 1 0 2 Yes, i am very dissapointed because i trusted her completely. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand. I have been through a similar situation. Was it a large amount of money? EOS 1 0 4 What did you do to come out of the tricky situation? Yes, it was for me, a total of$ 10000. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, That is a very large amount of money. I can understand your being upset with them.

1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you? EOS 1 0 2 Not so good. How are you doing? EOS 1 1 3 [Question] I am doing okay thank you for asking! would you like to talk about whats wrong? EOS 1 0 4 Yes. Well today I had a delivery order. So I went to McDonald' s and pick up the order and took it to the right address and after a few hours I notice that the client did not confirm the order. EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am not knowledgeable in this service industry. Let me understand. You delivered the order, but the customer did not confirm they wanted it..
0 1 0 [Question] hello how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hello I am taking a break from my studies to talk. I am fine thanks. Hope you are doing well also. I am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines. EOS 0 1 2 [Self-disclosure] i am fine thanks for asking. EOS 0 0 3 two exams and two assignments due at the end of this and next month. that' s good. EOS 0 1 4 [Others] Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful. EOS 0 0 5 yeah I have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it' s online and basically I do things on my own time.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you taking a lot of courses? EOS 0 0 7 2 courses. but I am pretty much using full time capacity on them. devoting full - time I mean. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] do you like doing school online better than in person? EOS 0 0 9 Have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good the more time you have to devote the better! EOS 0 0 11 I have done both methods. I definitely prefer in - school studies.. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel it is more stressful online? EOS 0 0 13 I am just disappointed that I have been slacking off and procrastinating. no it' s just that it' s a different avenue. I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. I think it' s because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow.. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after. EOS 0 0 15 yeah I take breaks in between.. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Yea this pandemic has me not as motivated to. EOS 0 0 17 But sometimes a lot more breaks or longer breaks than intended or I should. yeah definitely. Sorry to hear that.. It' s like everyday is the same and I can' t go out to refresh my mind or have a change of pace such as going to the gym or go out for a run. whereas before the pandemic, I can switch gears that way and come back refreshed. like going out to the movies and coming back with renewed enthusiasm. EOS 0 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Yea i have been missing the gym myself. Now i lookup youtube videos of workouts and do them, and it really helps to get me going in the day. Do you ever listen to music while you are trying to get work done? When i do that it tends to help time go faster and i get more done. EOS 0 0 19 I see. Yeah it' s good to have a routine and good way to resume life as usual.. sometimes I listen to music but I find it hard to read and absorb and listen to music. But I do listen to music sometimes when I am on assignments.. I also tend to drink coffee to focus my mind better. It does help. And I know I can pass the courses and on time but just that I am disappointed at my performance and work ethics as I know I have done much better before. So I am missing that sense of urgency, conscientiousness, and maturity., EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe find a nice meditation song to help relax you, i find when i am doing something finding a song with no words is better so i am able to concentrate.
3 0 0 I am so stressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi, what' s going on? EOS 3 0 2 I have a college course in the evening, but I cannot concentrate while distance learning. I am expected to watch the instructor do excel on a tiny phone screen and follow along. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oooff that sounds brutal... especially the excel part! do you have a bigger screen you can use? EOS 3 0 4 It is stressful. I am able to pull up zoom on my laptop, but it is almost more cumbersome because I must switch back and forth. I have to also manipulate an excel as well as watch the instructor. My colleagues in the class are annoying, because they do not know how to use mute correctly. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have access to a second screen or have the ability to stream the class on your tv through chromecast or something?
6 0 0 Hi. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. how are you? how may i help you today? EOS 6 0 2 Kinda sad today. Wanted to ask for some mental support. EOS 6 1 3 [Question] what is making you sad? EOS 6 0 4 Not being able to find a job after graduation. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand how you are feeling i had the same problem after i graduated. EOS 6 0 6 okay. EOS 6 1 7 [Question] have you put in job applications everywhere. EOS 6 0 8 Yes I did, and quite a lot but I think because of the pandemic they are not hiring that much. EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] With this pandemic going on i know it is even more harder to get a job.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how is your day? EOS 0 0 1 Not good. I was told today that my contract is not being renewed once it ends this month. I am very anxious about finding another job during pandemic. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see, It' s been a difficult year for all of us. But I think it would be possible to negotiate. EOS 0 0 3 But I tried negotiating. They are down - sizing the entire sales department. What else can I do? EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Hmmm, I can see that this is stressful for you. Did you already search for a new job? EOS 0 0 5 Yes I am preparing my resume but job vacancies are few and far between. I am worried about my next job. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Okay then, It' s good that you already started. But first of all stop being panicked. EOS 0 0 7 Ok. Do you have any ideas for sales positions? EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Search online and locally, get help from your friends and I assure you if you try hard enough you will suceed. EOS 0 0 9 I will. How can I get help from friends? Only very few are in sales field. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] And remember, what are we if we stop fighting? Your friends can support you emotionally at least and maybe they know a person that could help you. EOS 0 0 11 I agree. I should never give up. But due to financial commitments, I am somewhat afraid of failing. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Life is full of surprises, but we should get advantage of bad situations. It' s totally fine to be afraid, but also at the same time you should try harder to reach your goal. EOS 0 0 13 Yes, so far life has been kind to me even if it surprised me at few places! I will try to make the most of the situation.. You are right! Hard work will pay. I need to pull my socks up... EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Courage is not the absence of the fear, you should fight to find your place. EOS 0 0 15 Sure, after all I am known to be a fighter!. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah that' s the spirit. You can and you should get a job, so start right now!

EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That' s great to hear she is responding! EOS 4 0 8 I was happy to hear it too. I' ve been extra careful not to get it cuz of my parents. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] ah, are they elderly or have a weakened immune system? EOS 4 0 10 elderly. dads doctor told me not to meet friends in person cuz i could pass it onto him. EOS 4 1 11 [Others] gotcha. you must live with them to help them out! EOS 4 0 12 i sure do. thing is people my age are getting very sick with it too. and some elderly are not. so i could be helping myself more than my dad. EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] mine are in another state so i don' t have to worry about my behavior. you are right though, anyone can get it... i should probably be more careful myself. EOS 4 0 14 yes absolutely. never know. its a weird virus. best to keep immune system high which i have been. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] i have increased my vitamins i admit. have you as well? EOS 4 0 16 yes and started taking airborne for vitamin c. EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s great!
3 0 0 hello. anyone there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with today? EOS 3 0 2 am not fine. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What is it that is making you feel this way? EOS 3 0 4 i was cheated on severally, and it resulted me to end the relationship. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you had to deal with a partner recently cheating and a breakup, is this right?
3 1 0 [Question] hi how' s it going today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you? EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future? EOS 3 0 5 Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it' s true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online? EOS 3 0 7 Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression. EOS 3 0 9 How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] the" little black rain cloud" people? LOL I try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it' s our first.
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 2 I have been better. I had a rough semester in school.. EOS 6 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So things haven' t been going well at school. I think a lot of people are going through these days. EOS 6 0 4 It was alright at first but I failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade. EOS 6 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m sorry to hear that. That' s a heck of a situation to be in. Is there anything you can do? Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Not so great - found out i' m losing my job in january. EOS 2 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] On no I am sorry to hear that! I know that must be tough. EOS 2 0 3 Yes I' m not even sure what steps to take right now. EOS 2 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea that can be difficult. Have you started looking for something else? EOS 2 0 5 Not yet, I' m not even sure where to begin. I have not looked for a job in 20 years. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way. EOS 2 0 7 I' ve tried calling the unemployment office to get some ideas but they do not answer their phones. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Or you could look for some side jobs like cleaning or organizing things until you find something more permanent. EOS 2 0 9 Yeah, i' m kinda old for that - LOL!!! My back would not hold up to that - and my salary wouldn' t be comparable. EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea it seems to be hard to get up with a lot of places at this time. Persistent is the key. EOS 2 0 11 Well I hear that their offices are closed and you have to do everything online - so not sure if they can even help me. EOS 2 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes i understand right now is a very bad time to find anything with so many places closed. Do you have any family or friends to reach out to for help if needed? EOS 2 0 13 I think I might be able to call my friend, but she' s in another state. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you gave any thought to babysitting or are there any crafts you are good at making that maybe you could try to sell? EOS 2 0 15 That would not be enough money. I would not be able to pay my bills. EOS 2 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand your concern there but it could help pay some as to help you not to get to far behind until you find something. EOS 2 0 17 that' s true but i don' t want to lose my house either. EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] If i were you i would call your friend maybe she has some suggestions of things you could do based off of your skills. EOS 2 0 19 she may be able to help - she could at least send me in the right direction of where to look and maybe how to freshen up my resume. EOS 2 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] Yea and if not it wont have hurt to talk to her about it and all of the worry off your mind.
3 0 0 Hello. Hello? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hey how are you doing?. EOS 3 0 2 Doing alright, thanks. Yourself? EOS 3 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing fine, thank you.. EOS 3 0 4 Good to hear. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 6 I' ve been feeling very down lately. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] That sounds difficult, Would you like to elaborate on that? EOS 3 0 8 Sure. I feel depressed about the state of the US and of the rest of the world. It' s very overwhelming.. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now. EOS 3 0 10 Yes and a lot of uncetainty. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Most definitely, I' ve also been feeling a bit overwhelmed by what' s going on. How have you been coping? EOS 3 0 12 It' s good to know others feel the way I do. I' ve been trying to keep busy and not watch the news too much. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a good strategy, all the news outlets can be very overwhelming. EOS 3 0 14 Yes with lots of conflicting information. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] What do you like to do to keep busy? EOS 3 0 16 Work, read, exercise. I' ve been going to the gym more. EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Those sound like really good coping skills. EOS 3 0 18 Thank you. I' m trying. I really don' t want to be on medication. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a personal choice you' re completely allowed to make. It sounds like you have a good foundation for building on your ability to cope. EOS 3 0 20 I am trying. I don' t want to fall deep down an emotional black hole. EOS 3 1 21 [Question] Understandable. Do you talk with a therapist or have someone you trust you like to talk to? EOS 3 0 22 Yes, my husband is very supportive but I don' t want to upset him too much so I don' t fully open up. EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s great he is supportive. Seeing an individual counselor or someone of the like can also be helpful. They' re there for just you and they have unbiased opinions. A lot are doing telehealth right now. EOS 3 0 24 I will look into the telehealth. Thank you for that recommendation. EOS 3 1 25 [Self-disclosure] You' re welcome, hopefully it can be helpful. I, myself, have used telehealth therapy recently and it' s just been helpful with all the unprecedented chaos going on this year. EOS 3 0 26 I will give that a try. Thank you again. EOS 3 1 27 [Question] Is there anything else you would like to talk about or that I can help you with today?
3 0 0 Hello, I' ve been really depressed lately and feel like there isn' t anything I can do to break this feeling. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened?
4 0 0 Hi. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing these days? EOS 4 0 2 Not good. You? EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry to hear that. I am doing fine and hope I can cheer you up. EOS 4 0 4 Good to hear. Been feeling lonely due to this pandemic. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I totally understand it. I felt lonely too by staying home all the time. But I found we can borrow books online. A good book can really help. EOS 4 0 6 Do you mean physical or ebooks? EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Both will help. But ebooks are easier to get and you don' t need to contact anyone and anything outside your home.
3 1 0 [Question] Good afternoon how may I help you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello there. I' m suffering with increased depression and I' m not quite clear why. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello. How can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 What should I do. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Tell me about the situation that you are facing. EOS 0 0 3 I try to find a job but there is not many. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking? EOS 0 0 5 About 6 months. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that there are a lot of job loss in the Covid time. Is your job seeking related to that? Yeah it must be very difficult. EOS 0 0 7 yes. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and I got an offer in February right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you. I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family. EOS 0 0 9 I don' t know what types of jobs that fit me. yeah, but it is still rough to get by. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] Tell me more about it if you don' t mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking?
0 1 0 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hello, How are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 am fine. at least for now. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] would you like to talk about it? EOS 0 0 3 yeah... i have not been able to meet with my boyfriend physically due to the corona lockdown, and when i finally got to see him last month i discovered that he is cheating on me. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am so sorry that you had to go through that, I know this is a very difficult time for you. Has your boyfriend reached out to you at all to clarify things or to see if you are okay? EOS 0 0 5 he has but it is not sounding convincing enough. i feel so hurt. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Just By chatting with you, I can feel how hurt and upset you are. Is there anyone that can provide you support at home during this time?
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with this evening?. EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very depressed lately. Like a constant pressure that i don' t know exactly what it is. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I' m very sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 4 0 3 I think the days getting shorter makes it worse. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating. EOS 4 0 5 Do you have any tips on how to overcome it? EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help. I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through Instagram. I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while.. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up. I like to stay up, but when it' s time to get up i dread it. Bad cycle. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sure, that' s understandable. There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin D, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them.. EOS 4 0 9 Time is the fire in which we burn. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] Now that is intractable.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today.
1 1 0 [Question] hi. how can i help you? EOS 1 0 1 hi. i am really angry. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] are you saying that you are angry now? what happened dear? EOS 1 0 3 really angry at my friend. EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] can you tell me what happened so that i can understand?
1 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 1 0 1 I am just a little angry. My mother and I had another blow - up. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Is your bit of anger sparked from the interaction with your mother? EOS 1 0 3 It is why I am angry. This occurs at least every other day. I say something harmless and she thinks I am saying it in a way that is rude or something. EOS 1 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I bet you can figure out a way to communicate better.
1 0 0 Hi. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello though, how has life been treating you lately? EOS 1 0 2 It' s been a pretty crazy year. I' m mostly bummed because of my work. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It has been a really weird year hasn' t it? Don' t worry, I think it' s been the same for all of us. Would you like to tell me more details? EOS 1 0 4 Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else' s pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss( the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That really sucks! I can understand why you are angry and anxious about this and you have every right to be!. Are there any official routes that you can use to complain? EOS 1 0 6 I work in supply chain and I see the actual sales numbers and realized 4 months ago that we were actually on track to exceed our plans, even with the covid reductions. a few weeks later I heard him tell our sales director to keep the numbers artificially low so that they will both get their bonuses. I don' t think so... He' s the VP there isn' t anyone I can go to above him. EOS 1 1 7 [Others] That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint?. It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this. EOS 1 0 8 I don' t know if it is or not... I used my EAP benefit through work where you can talk to a councilor for free( 5 visits) and they said that it' s unfortunate but they didn' t think it was illegal. EOS 1 1 9 [Others] I am very sorry to hear that, that sounds extremely unfair to me. Have you considered looking for another job? I realise it' s a very difficult time to be looking for work right now though. EOS 1 0 10 yeah, it' s tough.. I don' t know if anyone is hiring. because of the timing like you mentioned. I' ve looked a little bit though. EOS 1 1 11 [Others] I really can' t wait for this year to be over! It' s been so awful. Do you suppose anyone at all has had a good year? EOS 1 0 12 haha I don' t know... I' m sure someone has... heck the VP is getting a Bonus... so I' m sure he' d say he' s having a good year. EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well yes fair point! Us poorer people are not doing very well though! Have you tried to talk with any of your coworkers about this? I would suggest that it might help. EOS 1 0 14 Amen.. That' s a good call, I' ve got a work buddy who I feel somewhat comfortable talking with. I may try and reach out to him. EOS 1 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really think you should. You have a legitimate grievance and being able to discuss it with people who understand might help a lot.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, I' m pretty much down. trying to keep my head afloat. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] im sorry to hear that. Would you care to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 3 0 3 I lost my job some months back and it hasn' t really been easy for me. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, loss of income can be very stressful. Have you been looking for work since then? EOS 3 0 5 Sometimes when I enter a place where my friends are, they tend to go silent when I enter the room. Yes. Its been months now and nothing yet. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Why do you think it is that they go silent? EOS 3 0 7 I' m pretty sure they were talking about me. 2 of myy friends have been helping me with rent money. and I' m pretty sure they must be fed up. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried picking up odd jobs maybe cleaning for someone or helping them move or organize there things? EOS 3 0 9 Yes I have. That' s what helps with feeding and getting some little things at home. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Have you asked them if this is causing problems? EOS 3 0 11 and sometimes I pay back little of what they loan me since I know I cant pay all of it. EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could offer to do some things for them in return for the money so its not like they are just giving it to you.
0 0 0 hello? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 stressed. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It is a stressful time, why are you feeling stressed? EOS 0 0 4 work, kids, school. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand. EOS 0 0 6 how many kids do you have? what kind of degree do you have? EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have 2 kids, How many kids do you have? I have a bachelor degree. EOS 0 0 8 6 year old twin boys and an 8 year old daughter. i' m divorced. they sleep at his house and he gets them off the bus. i start work at 6 so i cna get off at 2 and get them off the bus at 3. i' m going for my master' s degree. i am about halfway done. EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Managing things all become stressful, but Im sure you are really good at what you are doing! EOS 0 0 10 im so tired all the time. i feel lik everything i do just isnt enough. how do you handle things and stress? EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats are not true, You have beautiful kids, work and pursuing master' s. You are a great achiever. EOS 0 0 12 i guess. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Deep breaths and practicing mindfulness will help you relieve some stress. EOS 0 0 14 I WISH I HAD TIME LOL. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I sometimes do Meditation or go for a 10 mins walk. EOS 0 0 16 i guess it is worth a try. anythign else?* anything. EOS 0 1 17 [Others] Thats true with your busy schedule finding the balance is challenge.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling pretty good right now.. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk to me about? EOS 4 0 3 I have a friend who knew me since I was little. She is a little older than me. She still treat me like I' m still little. I tried to explain to her that I' m a grown woman and I grew out of lot of things when I was a kid.. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Is she listening to you? I know how it feels to be patronised by people who are older.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider!

EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all. EOS 0 0 45 Also being far away from him sucks. EOS 0 1 46 [Question] Are you guys FaceTiming or communicating at all other than by texts? EOS 0 0 47 You are being very helpful by the way thank you. We aren' t FaceTiming. I just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it.. EOS 0 1 48 [Greeting] I' m trying my best, thank you for the input! Upset about leaving the apartment? Or was there something else that happened that weekend? EOS 0 0 49 Just leaving him. EOS 0 1 50 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you guys thought about scheduling date nights through FaceTime? EOS 0 0 51 I think he would but he hasn' t been feeling really good about his appearance lately. I asked and that' s what he told me. EOS 0 1 52 [Self-disclosure] I understand that completely, I can relate a lot. EOS 0 0 53 Same. EOS 0 1 54 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If it makes any difference, my partner and I have been doing date nights where we would dress up, put make up on and do our hair and everything as if we were going to the restaurant, and even if it is through Facetime or whenever we see each other in real life, it helps not only with our own self - esteem but also our relationship. EOS 0 0 55 That is very cute. EOS 0 1 56 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could open the discussion with your boyfriend, tell him that you have a date planned over Facetime and you want him to order his favorite dinner, take a shower, do his hair and dress up real nice. EOS 0 0 57 I don' t know if he would be open to that but I could try. He isn' t really the romantic type. EOS 0 1 58 [Question] You have been friends for a long time before getting together, you guys are comfortable with each other, right? EOS 0 0 59 Yes. EOS 0 1 60 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay well you do know him more than I do haha, so what would be his ideal date night? EOS 0 0 61 Probably just being at home. EOS 0 1 62 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hm okay, well I' m sure that if you do propose and organize something for him, even if it is not his favorite thing to do, if he sees that it would make you happy, he will at least consider it don' t you think? EOS 0 0 63 Yeah probably. Things are hard right now though. EOS 0 1 64 [Question] In other ways than financially? EOS 0 0 65 The financial things make things emotionally hard. I am one of the only people he has in his corner right now. EOS 0 1 66 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I' m sorry to hear that... it must be difficult for you to be in this position, I understand the stress and pressure. Is the pandemic the reason he is having also financial difficulties at the moment?
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, what brings you to bring the seeker? EOS 6 0 1 I feel upset with myself over my situation. Did you read it? EOS 6 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I did not see it. What is your situation? I am here to listen. EOS 6 0 3 I feel ashamed of my depression symptoms. I feel other people are ashamed of me. EOS 6 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how? EOS 6 0 5 I just can' t live reguarly life like" healthy" people do and they notice my symptoms. They don' t understand how your mind can be your enemy. EOS 6 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are saying that you can' t live regularly and people don' t understand that your mind isn' t working in your favor. Is that right? Can you tell me what you mean by your mind being your enemy? EOS 6 0 7 Like I have no interest or motivation to do ANYTHING some days. Hard to even take care of my hygiene. My mind doesn' t care to do it even when it' s embarrasing for people to notice. EOS 6 1 8 [Greeting] That sounds very hard. I can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn' t want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself. What do you do to cope? EOS 6 0 9 stay away from mean people, stop tryiig to explain my symptoms to others who won' t get it. EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That makes sense why you would want to avoid doing these things, which is a good thing, but is there anything that you try to do that isn' t avoidance? Something that approaches something? EOS 6 0 11 I go to all my therapy appoints and try to participate. Thanks for your help. Have a good day. EOS 6 1 12 [Question] How do you feel about therapy? EOS 6 0 13 I have to go now. Bye. EOS 6 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is unfortunate, but I understand. We haven' t finished, the task, however, but I hope you feel better. EOS 6 0 15 I can stay a bit longer. I' m just tired. EOS 6 1 16 [Others] I think we just need 3 more responses each, let' s say.
2 1 0 [Question] hi! how are you doing today> EOS 2 0 1 Hello, I' m doing okay, wbu? EOS 2 1 2 [Others] ok it' s been a stressful time for most of us but we are all doing the best we can. EOS 2 0 3 Yeah that' s true. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] whats been the weirdest part of the pandemic for you? EOS 2 0 5 So I live with my boyfriend and my bestfriend. And I am afraid they are doing skethy stuff behind my back. It sounds crazy, and I don' t have any proof but I have this feeling. The way they talk around each other makes me nervous. EOS 2 1 6 [Question] hmm, tell me more. what do you think is going on? EOS 2 0 7 I' m scared when it is just the two of them here at home. And they are jsut so much more friendly together than before we moved in. EOS 2 1 8 [Question] living together can make people more comfortable with each other. has there been something specific that has caused you to wonder about them> EOS 2 0 9 Not really specifics. It' s more of a just in general sort of thing. I know them both really really well, so I am just picking up on tiny little details. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] i hear you. have you said anything to either one of them? EOS 2 0 11 I have talked to my boyfriend, but he just tells me that it' s crazy I would think something like that. Idk... I don' t want to sound crazy and blow it out of proportion if it' s really nothing. I don' t know if there is actually something I should be worried about, or if I am thinking these crazy thoughts for other reasons. EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] having doubts about relationships is rough. do you know brene brown? EOS 2 0 13 I don' t know who that is. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she researches shame and vunerability. EOS 2 0 15 Does she do live talks or videos? Or is she more in online writing. EOS 2 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she has a great TED talk! EOS 2 0 17 Oh that' s cool! I will have to check that out. So you think maybe I am feeling this way is because I have shame or vulnerability in the relationship? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] anyway, i find her imspirational when I have doubts. no, not really it' s the doubting that is likely what' s bothering you the most - the unknown. EOS 2 0 19 Yeah.. that' s true. I think it' s a good idea to learn more about how I' m feeling before I make any rash decisions. EOS 2 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s wise. theres a great youtube video with cartoon animals where brene talks about empathy.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Nice to meet you Jim, I am doing well. Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 3 I really appreciate your time Yes. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What is on your mind?

EOS 0 0 7 Yes, It would help us greatly. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have the right idea already. EOS 0 0 9 There are plenty of jobs and not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will find something suitable if you keep trying. EOS 0 0 11 Thanks What do you mean? Yeah, I know this but I don' t feel it.. EOS 0 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] You may feel a little apprehensive to get started. EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, I am. I know I can do it. Not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have been in the same position before and came out successful in the end. EOS 0 0 15 Wow, That' s great. How did you start?. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I just decided. EOS 0 0 17 What gave you the strength to go forward? I have this nervousness about getting rejected.. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing little things every day. EOS 0 0 19 So, keep myself busy and try to ignore my nervousness? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Really adds up and helps to get the big picture moving. EOS 0 0 21 OK, so with, well, kinf0f like baby steps.... right. EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It is about making small adjustments to feed a good habit. EOS 0 0 23 Build up my confidence and not take things personally. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Building it in to your daily life will make you feel accomplished. EOS 0 0 25 Yeah, so true. EOS 0 1 26 [Self-disclosure] THis really helped me to get going in the past.
4 0 0 Hi. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hi. How can I help you. EOS 4 0 2 I am not happy. I lost my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, thats bad. When you lost your job? EOS 4 0 4 about 4 months ago. EOS 4 1 5 [Question] In which field you are looking for? EOS 4 0 6 Bus driver and/ or Production. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can try as a school driver. As school now opened You will get it. EOS 4 0 8 That is what I did do but with union rules and bidding rights. There is not enough work. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try Uber and that is good choice as you are not doing anything. EOS 4 0 10 I tried but my cat is not new enough for their rules. EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh ok Take deep breath and just keep applying. I am sure you will get something good. Believe in god! EOS 4 0 12 God has been my source of comfort he' s my everything! EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] That' s really good. Keep trying your best. Apply everyday for job. You can start with grocery stores. I am assuring you that good time will come soon. EOS 4 0 14 Than - You it' s is good to talk about this I feel better. I will try to go to grocery stores maybe even can do deliveries. Are you there? EOS 4 1 15 [Others] yes. EOS 4 0 16 I am not so sad not. I will look for other suggestion you gave me. I cannot get unemployment because I only worked part - time. EOS 4 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] That is nice to hear from you. I thinks you are happy now.
6 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there! How may I support you? EOS 6 0 2 Well, I' m really upset with my friends. EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I am so sorry to hear that. Did something happen? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, they aren' t taking COVID seriously. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns? EOS 6 0 6 Yes but they get angry with me. I don' t know how to get through to them, EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It' s also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right. EOS 6 0 8 I really don' t know I just haven' t been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out. It' s a weird dynamic. EOS 6 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you' re finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it' s the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right? EOS 6 0 10 That' s exactly right. EOS 6 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is such a hard position to be in. it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance. EOS 6 0 12 I' d like to think so but I wish they would too. It' s hard to know what is right. EOS 6 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have found that having vitural movie nights, or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected. Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try? EOS 6 0 14 Yes, but they' ll have their BBQs and parties anyway. They are having a group Thanksgiving and there will be a lot of people there. My husband and I feel bad that we aren' t going, but we also know it isn' t smart. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can' t live your life in fear, and that they' re going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware. EOS 6 0 16 We feel like after this is all over, they will still remind us that we were standoffish during this time. And I agree. The longer we put it off and don' t take it seriously, the longer it will last. EOS 6 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Can you tell them that that just isn' t the case? You and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others. If I am correct, it has nothing to do with the fact that you don' t want to see your pals and family! From chatting with you it sounds like your relationships with these people is incredibly important to you.

1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave? EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 Am ok but feeling sad and anxious. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that you are sad and anxious. Do you know what is causing you to feel that way? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I recently lost my childhood best friend to covid 19. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can only imagine how sad you feel from losing your best friend. Hopefully chatting some will help. I know in the past when I lost someone it was nice to just have a conversation to help put my mind at ease. EOS 0 0 5 Sure. I feel so lonely sometimes because we were very close. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that you are feeling lonely. Did you have any mutual friends with your best friend that you can reach out to? I am sure they are feeling the same way and it could help both of you to talk to each other and share stories. EOS 0 0 7 Yes we have mutual friends. I do reach out to them sometimes. But the feeling doesn' t go away. It makes me have sleepless nights. I can' t sleep. Every time I close my eyes I see him very close to me like we are having conversations. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you were really close to your best friend. It can take time to get through the grief of losing someone. Things will get better I promise. EOS 0 0 9 I hope so too. And I hope he is a better place. Have you ever lost someone close to you? EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I lost my father when I was 19. That was pretty tough and it took me years to be OK with it. There are still days a decade later where I think about him and miss him. EOS 0 0 11 Sorry to hear that.. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Time heals all wounds. While that doesn' t sound helpful now it is true. I also found focusing on the good experiences I had with my father( or in this case your best friend) helps. Remembering the times where you both were happy.
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave? EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad. EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more. I feel that everyone must know that I' ve been dumped and be laughing at me. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time. EOS 1 0 10 I did not really have any choice though. I do not see any future for myself now that we are separated. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] do you know brene brown and her work. EOS 1 0 12 No I do not, who is that? EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her TED talk and there' s a great youtube video on empathy. EOS 1 0 14 Thank you, I will. Right now I really need some sort of emotional support. I feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i bring her up because what i sounds like is that you are feeling embarrassed because your partner made a choice that wasn' t you. in reality the choice they made wasn' t about you, it was about them. EOS 1 0 16 It is not so much that - it is that I feel that I dedicated the majority of my adult life to this relationship and now there is nothing left. EOS 1 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are left and you are enough. even if you dont feel like it right now you are enough. EOS 1 0 18 I really do not feel like it right now. What was the last fifteen years all about? I wanted to have children with him and he refused but now I hear he is expecting a baby with another woman. EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] a relationship is part of who you are. it isn' t you. EOS 1 0 20 But it is very difficult to try to strike out on my own again and I do not know if I even want to. EOS 1 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it is hard. it sucks. but the voyage through the suck is going to be better for you than you may realize right now. EOS 1 0 22 But I feel that I am facing middle age on my own and I really do not want to do that. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you have survived 14 days without a bad relationship. keep on doing that day by day and before you know it, you will be on the other side of the bad feelings.
3 0 0 I am feeling depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about your feelings? EOS 3 0 2 I feel lost and lonely, i do not know what to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] When did these feelings come about. EOS 3 0 4 They came about when i lost my job in August of this year. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can understand where your coming from with that, especially since this pandemic occurred. EOS 3 0 6 Yes, finances have especially been very tight. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] it seems like this could be overwhelming to you and trying to figure out the right path to go forward.
3 0 0 hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 i am ok so far. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 4 i am depressed. and need some inspiration. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression? EOS 3 0 6 Covid - 19. and money issues. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, this has really been a hard time for all of us. How has it impacted you personally? EOS 3 0 8 my mom and sister had caught the virus they are doing ok now but it was rough. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how hard that must have been. I' m glad they are doing ok now though! EOS 3 0 10 yeah me too. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] How have you been using your time during the crisis? EOS 3 0 12 yeah mostly working and meditation. EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] That' s great! Meditation is also something I' ve picked up during this time. It' s really helpful and can keep you balanced. Do you have a routine or do you just do it sporadically? EOS 3 0 14 i mostly do it sporadically but i do need to do it more often. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It' s great to try to integrate it into your day. All of us tend to have at least a few moments each day to ourselves. Even if it' s during a shower or bathroom break, you really can meditate anywhere! It' s all about being in the here and now. EOS 3 0 16 so true. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] When things get stressful, meditation can be difficult. Sometimes we get wrapped up so much in our emotions that trying to center yourself and focus on your breathing and the moment can be hard. One thing I' ve learned to be helpful when I' m stressed is to breathe in through my nose while internally counting to three and out through my mouth counting to three. The counting tends to distract my mind from whatever stressful thing I was thinking of before. EOS 3 0 18 i like that thank you for the tip i must use that more often. EOS 3 1 19 [Question] You' re welcome! Is there anything else you' d like to talk about?
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am very sorry to hear that. What are you sad about? EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently? EOS 4 0 5 It is over permanently... EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah I guess, the relationship was a little toxic and she sometimes only used me for money. Maybe is it for the best now that I think about it. EOS 4 1 8 [Others] Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!! EOS 4 0 9 Yeah I just miss having someone there for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] All you need now is to give yourself some TLC.. treat yourself to something nice and go easy on yourself. EOS 4 0 11 What is TLC. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] There will be someone else. I never thought I' d find anyone else but I did and we' ve been together ten years ago now! Tender Loving Care:) Means be good to yourself. EOS 4 0 13 Ok yeah your story is very inspirational to me. Maybe this was needed in order to find the right person. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anything you can do to distract yourself right now? Plan a holiday or take a night class or something? EOS 4 0 15 I am now doing mturk to get my mind off of it to make some extra money. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Save up what you make and buy yourself something nice? EOS 4 0 17 yeah the only problem is I am barely getting any money from this. Do you have any tips onto how I can make more money/ EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There is some very lucrative stuff out there:). Take what we are doing right now for instance. EOS 4 0 19 I mean 15 minutes for 2$ doesn' t seem very lucrative. but I guess it ads up. EOS 4 1 20 [Question] beats flipping burgers;). So, what are you going to do to get yourself back onto the dating market? EOS 4 0 21 I am going to wait for this whole covid thing to end and then get a real job and once I fix my financial situation I will start dating again. EOS 4 1 22 [Others] Ah yes, the world feels like it' s on hold at the moment doesn' t it? Probably not a good time to start sharing germs with new people: D.
0 0 0 I have anxiety about what avenue to take academically. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello! Don' t worry, I am here to help. So you are saying that you are not sure what career to study? EOS 0 0 2 I do have an idea about it but I am anxious about choosing wrong and boxing myself into something I wish I hadn' t chosen. EOS 0 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Even if you chose wrong, you will generally have plenty of time to make up your mind and choose something that you really like:), plus, you can reach out to academic advisors, for example. EOS 0 0 4 I suppose you' re right, I think I don' t have confidence in myself that what ever I do choose, I will be good at it. Good enough to make a life out of it. fear of failing myself because i lose interest in things over time. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently. EOS 0 0 6 but what if that thing is your career choice? EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is a totally normal aspect of human nature. It' s normal to get bored of things even if we really liked them at some point. Of course, some topics like those are more serious, but as I said, even if you chosed wrong, you can always change your major. EOS 0 0 8 I guess thats right. All I care about is helping others so as long as the choice i make supports that then it will be fine. thank you for your help. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] No problem, and it' s great that you like helping others. I am a firm believer that ultimately making others happy is what makes us happy. EOS 0 0 10 yes, it is very rewarding to do so, it should be a part of everyone' s life choices. i agree with you on that. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Remember to always keep a positive mindset. I am sure you will sort this out in no time. Is there anything else I can help you with today? EOS 0 0 12 I am sure you are right, I just get caught up in my thoughts too much. have a great day! no thank you. are you still there. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, sorry. And it has been a pleasure:) EOS 0 0 14 why does it say im ending the chat early when it has been enough time already. EOS 0 1 15 [Others] Try again, you have to hit quit and fill the questionarie.

0 0 0 Hi how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I' m doing fine, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 Doing ok, thanks. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] thats good what do you have planned for the holidays? EOS 0 0 4 Not a whole lot due to the economic hardship my family and I are facing. How about you?. as far as holiday plans. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I completely understand that i feel that pain as well. are you there? EOS 0 0 6 oh I am sorry to hear that. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s ok there are plenty of other things that you can do with family during this time. EOS 0 0 8 Thats true that should be the holiday spirit and keep hope alive. EOS 0 1 9 [Question] exactly so what else do you have planned are you ready for the new year? EOS 0 0 10 Cook a good meal and spend time with my kids and spouse. Gifts wont be extravagant this year but I guess its the thought that counts. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes it' s the thought that counts and being blessed to be around love ones. EOS 0 0 12 Totally, thanks for that insight. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I myself is going to enjoy good food and enjoy hopefully some decent winter weather. your welcome. EOS 0 0 14 very nice, does it snow where you live?

4 0 0 hi, how are you? My friend, My best friend, has a new friend and hardly has time for me anymore, we have been friend for over ten years. this hurts. EOS 4 1 1 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before. EOS 4 0 2 its so annoying and hurtful. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Yeah i can tell you something you might not want to hear but it ended with us ending our friendship on that level. EOS 4 0 4 i definitely do not want to end our friendship, that would be even more painful. EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years. We still hang out but it isnt like it was before. People move on to others and it hurts. They usually are not trying to hurt us though. EOS 4 0 6 I know, but its hard when you are the one still stuck, Im not ready for change. EOS 4 1 7 [Others] Yea it was hard for me too. Thats the thing about change it just happens. I would do something focusing on yourself. Trying to make yourself feel better. EOS 4 0 8 i could try to focus on myself. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everyone needs to and everyone forgets too heh. EOS 4 0 10 I agree, i need to focus more on myself. EOS 4 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Good, im glad you can realize that! Some people cant. EOS 4 0 12 its hard to but I know that its time to focus on me more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Great, any ideas on what you would like to focus on? EOS 4 0 14 focus on me, doing things by myself instead of with my friend. going to eat, spa time, me time, only with me. then allow myself to make new friends. do you have any suggestions that i can focus on. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Those are great ideas actually, When i want some me time, i usually go for a nice long hike or run. EOS 4 0 16 i thinks hikes and runs are good too, they actually are peaceful and makes me focus on life. EOS 4 1 17 [Others] Yeah, it helps i think even down to a chemical level. Kinda like a great reset for our minds. EOS 4 0 18 reset of our minds, interesting. i will try hiking for sure. thanks for your input. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Great, i just want you to know that your friend moving to a different person is not your fault. Its an unfortunate side of life.
3 0 0 i am feeling sad. my boyfriend left me out of the blue. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so sorry for hearing that. Do you want to talk more detail about that? EOS 3 0 2 yes, i want to. i am unable to concentrate in anything. i feel so negative about my life. what is the point of this relationship then? EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You seem really focus on just one person. Life is rich. Think about other important people in your life such as parents, friends. EOS 3 0 4 i can understand all of this. may be i need some time. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes of course you should take your time as long as you want and you can do it, one day you can leave all those problem. EOS 3 0 6 hoping the same. want to be the happy person like i was before. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Also do exercise, yoga, workout, talk your friends, listen to music etc sort of things might help you a lot. whatever works for you, you' ll try them out. Just chatting with you, you seem very a smart, strong girl. Do not be upset about things you can' t control. EOS 3 0 8 i think i should divert my concentration on something else. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] For sure, what else we need to talk about? EOS 3 0 10 it really hurts when the person means you the most becomes unavailable out of the blue without stating any reason. nothing. thanks for your support anyways. i am glad talking to you. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I feel the same way. EOS 3 0 12 thank you then. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] Sure, is there anything that I can help you.
0 0 0 Hello, is anone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Yes sorry, the app was misbehaving. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I don' t know. I' m shaking because I don' t know what I' m going to do. EOS 0 1 3 [Others] Im sorry to hear that, but going to do about what situation specifically? EOS 0 0 4 I know you' re busy prepping for the holiday but I described my problem earlier. It should be listed either at the top or on the left side of your screen. I know you' re probably prepping for the holiday. I didn' t mean to interrupt your Sunday. EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Im sorry but we do not get those promps. We just get to talk pretty much, we have to find out whats going on. You are not interrupting anything. EOS 0 0 6 Here! Last Christmas I bought the condo of my dreams. This April 2020 I lost my job due Covid 19. My unemployment is ending and my savings are depleted. I' ve recived an eviction notice and don' t know what to do. Help! Have you ever been evicted? EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Where are you that you are able to be evicted? You should not be able to be evicted from your home during this time in pretty much every state. Have you tried contacting anyone for help other than your landlord? EOS 0 0 8 I' m still in my condo but I no longer have a job, umemployment has run out and my savings are all gone. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well the plus side is they cannot kick you out right now. Have you talk to your landlord about working out some payment arrangement. Have you tried applying for any job? Now is not the time for pride to get in the way, i would accept anything. EOS 0 0 10 When you say work out a plan what do you mean? I have no job. I have been applying for jobs but I haven' t received a callback or an offer of employment. Have you ever been in this situation? Also, I' m calling a helpline so Pride is not my issue. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different. I am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass. I was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures. They could work out a way you can pay extra monthly when you get back on your feet. EOS 0 0 12 It' s kind of hard to work out a plan when you don' t know where your next meal is coming from don' t you think? Do you know anything about the eviction process and where do people go once they have been evicted. Who is this they that your speaking about? I don' t mean to be crass either but I have never been jobless or homeless either. So I' m desperate here and don' t know what to do? EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Your landlord. I worked out a way with payments when i was furloughed from my job. And yes i was actually homeless many years ago so i do know what it feels like to miss out on meals for a days at a time. It seems you should look up evictions during Covid. They are not allowed to throw you on the street as long as the pandemic is going on.
4 0 0 I am so embarassed and saddened. I can not believe he cheated on me. I thought we were going to work out. I was really attracted into him and I cared for him a lot. I wanted to date him longer. Thank Goodness I did not sleep with him. What a disaster. Why are men like this? Why do they break women' s hearts? I wish there were more decent men out there that did not play around. Men can be such pigs! EOS 4 1 1 [Question] what happened? EOS 4 0 2 I met a handsome intelligent man. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how are you feeling lately? EOS 4 0 4 We dated for a month. Then out of nowhere he cheated on me. I' m so sad. I am just trying to understand what I did wrong. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s okay. we should learn from things like this. EOS 4 0 6 That' s true. It' s crazy we have to experience heart ache. To learn... EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] don' t think much and keep yourself engaged in the activities you like the most. EOS 4 0 8 Hey, that is great advice! EOS 4 1 9 [Question] can you tell me how are you before this incident? EOS 4 0 10 I was happy. But when a man breaks your heart, it makes you feel very ugly. EOS 4 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] can you share me some happy memories which made you smile. EOS 4 0 12 Sure, I love going to the movies! How about you! EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] it' s okay. i can understand. yeah me too. i love movies and traveling. EOS 4 0 14 Are you American? EOS 4 1 15 [Others] I love traveling to new places. EOS 4 0 16 Yes traveling is what we are made to do as humans! EOS 4 1 17 [Others] yes, i am an american. what about you. EOS 4 0 18 Same. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] well, just think of some happy memories and try to spend time with people who value you the most. EOS 4 0 20 Yes, thank you for the great advice! Like Thanksgiving, I hope you have wonderful memories with your friends and family next week. EOS 4 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] oh, thats nice of you. thank you. EOS 4 0 22 You are very welcomed! EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] you too! EOS 4 0 24 Well what are you having for lunch? EOS 4 1 25 [Others] i had my breakfast just now. i am planning to cook some beef for lunch. what about you.
0 0 0 Hello, I' m having a terrible day. My name is Sean and I work for a large distribution company. EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] hi! i' m sorry to hear that. how is your work going so far. EOS 0 0 2 The problem with a job like Amazon or Kehe distribution is the quotas. The pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID? EOS 0 0 4 no COVID 19 has nothing to do with any of this work. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how anxious you are right now. Can you give me some more info on your job. EOS 0 0 6 well when there are 50 million americans out of work right it' s a bit scary. i' m a forklift operator..... I move pallets from one area of the warehouse to another but i. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i totally understand how nerve wrecking this is, but trust me you guys being front - line workers are our real heros.
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? EOS 1 0 22 He' s a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly. EOS 1 0 24 But maybe I deserved it. EOS 1 1 25 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly. EOS 1 0 26 Yes, he did. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No you did not! Please don' t think like that. EOS 1 0 28 I' m just so angry that I could break something. And maybe I will do that! EOS 1 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this. EOS 1 0 30 But what if it doesn' t pass? And I cannot afford therapy. EOS 1 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now. There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free. EOS 1 0 32 I don' t know if I could do that. I don' t like talking about my problems with strangers. EOS 1 1 33 [Self-disclosure] And yet here we are: P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found.. I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that I was. EOS 1 0 34 Do you have any suggestions about how to open up to people I don' t know? EOS 1 1 35 [Others] I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No - one will be judging you. EOS 1 0 36 That' s what I am afraid of. Being judged by people. EOS 1 1 37 [Question] Do you think that this might partly because your ex has eroded your self esteem?. EOS 1 0 38 Probably. He called me a lot of names. EOS 1 1 39 [Others] The important thing is to gradually rebuild your self esteem. Do you have any things that you excel at?. EOS 1 0 40 I' m good at bowling. And I like riding horses. EOS 1 1 41 [Others] Animals are a wonderful source of comfort when we are feeling very low! Could you join a riding club to make some new friends? EOS 1 0 42 Maybe I will do that. Horses are so cool. EOS 1 1 43 [Reflection of feelings] I can feel that you are starting to make progress already and are thinking of things that you can do post break up. EOS 1 0 44 I sure am. Thanks for your help. EOS 1 1 45 [Greeting] You are most welcome. Is there anything else you would like to talk to me about? EOS 1 0 46 I don' t think so... EOS 1 1 47 [Others] Well, I wish you all the very best for the future. I know that things seem terrible right now but please believe me they will get better. EOS 1 0 48 Thanks! Have a good day. EOS 1 1 49 [Others] And you have a lovely day too. I know that you are going to be just fine in a few weeks from now. Stay strong!
0 1 0 [Question] hello how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hello I am taking a break from my studies to talk. I am fine thanks. Hope you are doing well also. I am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines. EOS 0 1 2 [Self-disclosure] i am fine thanks for asking. EOS 0 0 3 two exams and two assignments due at the end of this and next month. that' s good. EOS 0 1 4 [Others] Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful. EOS 0 0 5 yeah I have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it' s online and basically I do things on my own time.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you taking a lot of courses? EOS 0 0 7 2 courses. but I am pretty much using full time capacity on them. devoting full - time I mean. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] do you like doing school online better than in person? EOS 0 0 9 Have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good the more time you have to devote the better! EOS 0 0 11 I have done both methods. I definitely prefer in - school studies.. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel it is more stressful online? EOS 0 0 13 I am just disappointed that I have been slacking off and procrastinating. no it' s just that it' s a different avenue. I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. I think it' s because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow.. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after. EOS 0 0 15 yeah I take breaks in between.. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Yea this pandemic has me not as motivated to. EOS 0 0 17 But sometimes a lot more breaks or longer breaks than intended or I should. yeah definitely. Sorry to hear that.. It' s like everyday is the same and I can' t go out to refresh my mind or have a change of pace such as going to the gym or go out for a run. whereas before the pandemic, I can switch gears that way and come back refreshed. like going out to the movies and coming back with renewed enthusiasm. EOS 0 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Yea i have been missing the gym myself. Now i lookup youtube videos of workouts and do them, and it really helps to get me going in the day. Do you ever listen to music while you are trying to get work done? When i do that it tends to help time go faster and i get more done. EOS 0 0 19 I see. Yeah it' s good to have a routine and good way to resume life as usual.. sometimes I listen to music but I find it hard to read and absorb and listen to music. But I do listen to music sometimes when I am on assignments.. I also tend to drink coffee to focus my mind better. It does help. And I know I can pass the courses and on time but just that I am disappointed at my performance and work ethics as I know I have done much better before. So I am missing that sense of urgency, conscientiousness, and maturity., EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe find a nice meditation song to help relax you, i find when i am doing something finding a song with no words is better so i am able to concentrate. EOS 0 0 21 I see. That' s a good idea. I was also thinking I should have a regular workout routine at home again because I used to work out much more daily, even at home.. EOS 0 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are a very smart person and are able to acknowledge when you need to work harder on something. Don' t be to hard on yourself this pandemic is affecting everyone. EOS 0 0 23 working out does help me focus and be productive.. Thank you and I do agree with you on the pandemic. But this is a part of my mistake too but I think coming away from our conversation, I am more optimistic now having talked to someone about it.. EOS 0 1 24 [Self-disclosure] Yes i would imagine that would help to, i found that before i started working out at home i was beginning to feel lazy and not getting anything done, but that has all changed now. EOS 0 0 25 I see. Hopefully your routines are much better and more productive now. EOS 0 1 26 [Others] Aww well try not to be to hard on yourself. Set some daily goals and i bet you will be back to feeling normal in no time. I am glad talking has helped! EOS 0 0 27 yeah that' s another thing. It does work better for me if I were to write down some sort of itinerary of what I should get through today, etc. So you' re right.. well thank you for listening then and providing some very helpful input.. Yeah you' ve been more than helpful! Thank you.. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are welcome, best of luck with all your studies! EOS 0 0 29 Just can' t wait to finish the two courses these two months and I can finally relax and enjoy the holidays at least. thank you very much. And I hope you best of luck with all your endeavours! EOS 0 1 30 [Greeting] Thank you!
0 1 0 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today? EOS 0 0 1 I am so stressed out because my business has suffered this year. I am very worried I may have to close and I won' t be able to pay my bills. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is really tough. a lot of people are going through that, you are not alone. what kind of business do you have? EOS 0 0 3 I sell cosmetics. I think a lot of people don' t have money to buy non essential items right now. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] christmas is right around the corner though, and it is almost the 15th. military get paid the 1st and 15th so there is still hope for a christmas rush! tax season is right around the corner too... there is defineately still reason to keep hope. EOS 0 0 5 That might be true. I just don' t know that business will ever recover. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you online or in store? EOS 0 0 7 Mostly online. EOS 0 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] thats great then, online businesses are less likely to fail. you know, i am in construction and there are soo many zoom meetings. honestly, i was in an office with 4 people and hardly wore make up. now with all these meetings i amd doing meetings constantly and i have had to start wearing more make up to look more profesional. i know it can be scry, but you ust have to keep a positive attitude. EOS 0 0 9 Yeah we don' t have to shut down. But with so many people struggling to make ends meet, there just doesn' t seem to be enough left over to buy extra things. and that' s true. There are people on zooms that want to wear makeup. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] also, i think it depends on where you are in the world. covid hit my area really hard around april/ may, but things are completely back to normal now. people hardly wear masks, stores are open, it just takes time. EOS 0 0 11 That' s definitely not the case here. But I can see what you mean. EOS 0 1 12 [Others] maybe you could distritubute samples to hospitals for the nurses as a christmas present. put your card in. you KNOW they have job stability and it could lead to sales!
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how is your day today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. Not so good. I lost my cat recently. It surely feels... overwhelming at times. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] That is a very hard thing to be going through where you very close to your cat? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, I had her for 11 years. She died of natural causes. I lived alone with her. The house feels extremely empty now... EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am very sorry to hear that i have also lost a pet earlier this year his name was fish and was only 3 years old he unfortunately passed due to liver cancer. It was a very trying experience but slowly the pain of his passing has got a little bit easier. Have you tried talking about this loss to friends of family? EOS 3 0 5 No. My family lives in another country, and I really don' t have any close friends. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] What have your feelings been like after the passing of your cat?
6 0 0 hi my friend. EOS 6 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] Hello! How are you doing? EOS 6 0 2 feeling very shame. EOS 6 1 3 [Question] Oh my god! What happened? EOS 6 0 4 i have cheated on my girlfriend. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel sorry for you.. What was the reason behind that? I understand how you are feeling right now. EOS 6 0 6 me and my girlfriend mom had an physical relationship but till now my girlfriend belives im good guy. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Calm down friend. EOS 6 0 8 what should i do now. EOS 6 1 9 [Question] Can i know the reason why you got attracted to her mom when she herself is there? Chill out friend, feel good atleast now you have realised your mistake. Whatever happened has happened, forget everything. EOS 6 0 10 i have gone to her home. her mom taken advantage to me what should i dothat time so we did it. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand, so now forget from beng guilty.
4 1 0 [Question] Hey there, what' s going on today? EOS 4 0 1 Hello. It is a fine day, how about yourself? EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] It really is! I am just taking in the fresh air in the backyard. EOS 4 0 3 That is awesome. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Thanks! What is going on in your neck of the woods? EOS 4 0 5 Sort of stuck inside trying to make a dime but it is alright. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Yeah great minds think alike.. do you do anything else for work? EOS 4 0 7 Looking for a good job right now. I wanted to talk about a personal issue I have been having, though. EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Okay, you know I' m here for you. Talk to me, what' s happening? EOS 4 0 9 My father and I had a fight 2 years ago and haven' t spoke since. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] The same happened to me, and then my father passed away. If there is anything I can say, is to swallow pride and cherish the moments you have on earth together. What was the fight over? EOS 4 0 11 Yeah I am afraid that these things can happen. It was only over material things. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] That was my next question, what the fight was over. Do you think he would be open to mending things? EOS 4 0 13 It is weird because I called him out for being manipulative so this is his defense.. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Usually when people feel singled out, they only have a few mechanisms. Unfortunately, most people tend to run away instead of fixing things. It tends to be the easier option. EOS 4 0 15 I would likely take advantage of an opportunity to be the bigger person. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] When you try to fix things, just remember that this is his method. I wouldn' t hold back on what you have to say, but just word it so that he doesn' t feel the need to flee.
2 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you feeling today? EOS 2 0 1 Hi. I' m feeling okayish. EOS 2 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest.
0 0 0 Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, what seems to be on your mind?. EOS 0 0 2 Friends and our relationships amongst one another. Two are arguing and I want to help both. We only can facetime each other because of Corona and it is taking a toll among our group. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I see. How long have your two friends been arguing? EOS 0 0 4 It has been around 4 months now. It started slowly and now has ramped up to where it' s exploding and causing discourse among us all. One of my friends told a secret to another acquaintance outside of our group. My friend is raging over this which she should. trust was broken. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like tempers are all running pretty hot for everyone right now, is that correct? EOS 0 0 6 I believe in forgiveness, and the friend that told is very remorseful How do I help them? EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Well, it sounds like you are in a tough spot since both your friends are so mad at each other.. Why do you think your one friends shared a secret they were supposed to keep? EOS 0 0 8 The acquaintance knew something of the secret because she had experienced this before. I think my friend was more - so trying to help my other friend, not betray her. She went outside the group but not for spitrful reasons i think. EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I think I understand. Sometimes we accidentally hurt the people we love when we are trying to help. EOS 0 0 10 I want one friend to know that the other was trying to hel and nothurt, but did not think clearly when deciding where to get help from. How do I make her understand this? EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it is great that you want to actively help, it says a lot about you. EOS 0 0 12 Thanks! What should I say to her? EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes the best way to help someone understand is to give them a little time and space. Trying to force someone to understand doesn' t always work. EOS 0 0 14 I think this can be good because she IS a little hot headed. Goos advice! I think I will tell everyonr in our circle to fall back and let her come to us when she is ready. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could also try talking to your hurt friend like this and ask her if she thinks the other friend truly meant to hurt her. I bet she knows that wasn' t the case. I bet you guys will all be friends again in no time.
0 0 0 Hi. Is anyone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hi there. EOS 0 0 2 Hi I thought you were not going to show. my anxiety level just increased while I was waiting for you. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Apologies, I have had issues with my connection which should now be resolved. How can I help you today. EOS 0 0 4 I am having a panic attack. I have to come up with 100 by next week to meet my minimum charge. on my credit card. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you need to find 100, have limited time to do this and this is causing you anxiety as a result? EOS 0 0 6 yes it sure is. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, I can tell you are really worried about this and want to find a way to remove the pressure from this situation. EOS 0 0 8 yes any suggestion s. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any friends or family that you can speak to about this? If they were aware of this issue and how much it is affecting you, they may be able to support. EOS 0 0 10 They are swamped with their own bills and we live pay check to pay check. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried contacting the credit card company and explaining your situation?
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Greeting] hi there. How are you?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello. How can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 What should I do. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Tell me about the situation that you are facing. EOS 0 0 3 I try to find a job but there is not many. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking? EOS 0 0 5 About 6 months. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that there are a lot of job loss in the Covid time. Is your job seeking related to that? Yeah it must be very difficult. EOS 0 0 7 yes. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and I got an offer in February right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you. I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family. EOS 0 0 9 I don' t know what types of jobs that fit me. yeah, but it is still rough to get by. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] Tell me more about it if you don' t mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking? EOS 0 0 11 I worked in manufacturer. technical skill in trade school but not degree from college. EOS 0 1 12 [Others] I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position? EOS 0 0 13 I will seek for another jobs if possible but I can work on manufacturer company too. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the Covid time? EOS 0 0 15 If I can work remotely I will do it. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have been browsing job boards every now and then. There are consistently some grocery store jobs, or cashier jobs. If you don' t mind the location, I am sure you would be a good fit for these. EOS 0 0 17 The job market is very competitive. I tried but there are no responds after my interview. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I completely understand. I was looking for jobs for almost a year. I have a spreadsheet that keeps track of all the jobs I applied. Maybe only 2 or 3 percent of them replied( with an interview request, etc.) I would suggest trying applying for jobs via Linkedin, or google jobs. You can sort them by posted date. My experience is that the more recent the posting date is, the more likely they will review your application. EOS 0 0 19 Thanks, I will try more on the website you suggest. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] Previously I also registered in a few temp agencies that would place me in companies with the intension of only keeping in on board for a few months/ weeks. They can be a good gap filler as well. EOS 0 0 21 Do they charge you when you get a job? EOS 0 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] I hope I can be more helpful. I really sympathize with your situation. They would just terminate me after they have found a permanent employee on an ongoing basis. In rare situations, they would hire" temp - to - hire" with the expectation of hiring temp workers.
2 0 0 Hello. Maybe you can help me calm down. I just found out that I' m losing my job in January.( 1) EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hello! I hope I can. I am so sorry to hear that. That' s so rough.

So many people are out there looking for work.( 8) EOS 2 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online career counselors or resume helpers, they can help you figure out how to make your resume stand out. What industry are you in? EOS 2 0 16 I' m an accountant( 9) EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So you' re smart! You will defintiely find a job, i have total faith in you. EOS 2 0 18 Well, with numbers at least! I just worry about companies that aren' t able to be open, well they won' t need an accountant.( 10) EOS 2 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think with the vaccine coming, things will be going back to normal soon enough! They already started giving the vaccine out.

EOS 4 0 7 where will I g et almost 3 thousand dollars. It is too painful. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I do not know.. have you considered taking an extra job on the side? EOS 4 0 9 yes, i do. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to get help with finding the books? Someone could have handed them in. EOS 4 0 11 school, should just give me enough time to find the books. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you have any idea of where you lost them? EOS 4 0 13 allow me to clear myself later, it is a fucking thing. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] I am sorry, I do not understand what you mean. EOS 4 0 15 I am trying to find that out, I packed them inside one bag, may be someone carried the bag or I misplace them. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Try not to worry, it is entirely possible that someone has found them and handed them in to the authorities. You might still get them back! EOS 4 0 17 i need enough time to look for the books, but school is not ready to listen to me. EOS 4 1 18 [Question] That is really not fair of them.

3 0 0 i am feeling sad. my boyfriend left me out of the blue. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so sorry for hearing that. Do you want to talk more detail about that? EOS 3 0 2 yes, i want to. i am unable to concentrate in anything. i feel so negative about my life. what is the point of this relationship then? EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You seem really focus on just one person. Life is rich. Think about other important people in your life such as parents, friends. EOS 3 0 4 i can understand all of this. may be i need some time. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes of course you should take your time as long as you want and you can do it, one day you can leave all those problem.
4 0 0 Hi I am so sad my boyfriend was cheating and broke up with me when I found out. I don' t think I can ever be happy again. EOS 4 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self - esteem is that true? EOS 4 0 2 I have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. I have lost interest in everything I can barely make myself go to work. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better? EOS 4 0 4 Maybe, why would he cheat? I have seen her she is not that pretty. I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination. EOS 4 1 5 [Others] remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren' t right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else.
4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 tired. and u? EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like an exhausting time for a lot of people right now.

EOS 4 0 11 yea the travis scott one and the nas one just happened yesterday. think there is only one showing left today then theyre done. it was ok nothing amazing. EOS 4 1 12 [Others] Oh good to know. Yeah, I don' t know if virtual concerts can ever really compare to live ones. EOS 4 0 13 whos some of your favorite artists? EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Well, I' m in my 30s so I like the artists who were big about the time I was in high school/ college since I have fond memories of that. So, artists like Nelly, 50 cent, Eminem. Also I' m from California so I have to say Tupac. What about you? EOS 4 0 15 I love those guys too. Need to listen to more of their discographys though. My favorites are kendrick lamar and kanye west. 15 mins past. I guess we' re done. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yeah, Kendrick is awesome and makes actual meaningful music.

EOS 3 0 9 I noticed a few signs and confronted him about it. He didn’t even deny it! He wasn’t remorseful at all... it’s like he doesn’t even love me. How can you love someone yet betray the, somquiclu. So quickly** EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] did he admit to it? I would agree that he probably doesn' t feel the way you want him to.

0 1 0 [Question] Hi there! What would you like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 1 I am trying to be fine and you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] It may be helpful to know.. my name is Ann. I am 43 years old... and I know for myself, I enjoy talking to people when I have concerns. What is going on? EOS 0 0 3 Thank you for your concern, I am just worried. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What has you worried? I know right now... its a hard time for so many people. I have struggled with my own anxiety the past few weeks. EOS 0 0 5 Sorry about that. This is about my relationship. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah.... relationship worries can be so draining and emotionally exhausting. I can understand that. In your relationship, what has happened to create your worries? EOS 0 0 7 I trusted my spouse but eventually disappointed. She got a jot in another town and she utilize the opportunity to be sleeping around. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine how a break in trust has made you feel. I know a break in trust is always very difficult to process.
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability. EOS 3 0 21 i applied for disability but didn' t get it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself. EOS 3 0 23 yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn' t matter. EOS 3 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Social Security stopped you. Why? EOS 3 0 25 i' m not injured enough for them. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can file against the company if you can prove neglect in the employer.. Were there proper safety guards. EOS 3 0 27 I tried but since it is the state of PA they have immunity. no. EOS 3 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was a state injury, there must be an avenue you can use to prove neglect. EOS 3 0 29 I was told that I assumed the risk of injury working for them. It was a mental hospital. EOS 3 1 30 [Question] have you contacted OSHA and filed a complaint with them? EOS 3 0 31 not yet. I should. EOS 3 1 32 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There should be an avenue for you to seek compensation. EOS 3 0 33 The lawyer fought with them for over a year. There was even an appeal but I lost that too. EOS 3 1 34 [Reflection of feelings] It is unfortunate that safety is not a factor. It was a state hospital? EOS 3 0 35 yes. EOS 3 1 36 [Question] Did a patient attack you? EOS 3 0 37 yes. EOS 3 1 38 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There must be liability concerning your injury.
0 0 0 Hello. Feeling low today. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it. EOS 0 0 2 I' ve been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn' t go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint?
1 1 0 [Question] Hi - how are you today? EOS 1 0 1 hey! an doing better but things at work place gets me real down. EOS 1 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What' s going on at work that' s making you upset? EOS 1 0 3 i think boss hate me. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That can be very uncomfortable. Are there reason you feel that way? EOS 1 0 5 nothing i do pleases the man. all he does is complain. EOS 1 1 6 [Question] Ugh - is he like this with everyone else, too - or do you think it' s just directed at you?
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic? EOS 0 0 16 so literally, I only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. I only started a new work in September, and it' s not much( about two days a week), so I can' t comment too much about that. It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps. EOS 0 0 18 so I get nervous in general when I am at work but I do my work just the same. May not be able to work as well because I have to breathe through a mask, and some other small difficulties. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is good that you can continue to do your work the same. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you for all the positive messages so far and in understanding and sympathizing with me.. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] Is there anything else I should know about how the pandemic is affecting you? EOS 0 0 22 pretty much. If anything, it' s my academic life at home that has changed not so well.. EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Are you a student?
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. EOS 6 0 1 hello. how are you? I wanted to briefly chat about my jealous feeling. My friend sent me a pic as a greeting showing her hubby and I am jealous. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] I am doing good. How are you? EOS 6 0 3 Next time I see her I want to hide my jealous feeling, but not sure if I can do it well. great. I am good. EOS 6 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so, you envy your friend having a good spouse, is that correct?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not.
0 0 0 hey. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m good, busy. I need another job to pay more bills. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having a difficult time with your finances. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 yes somewhat. i can pay it off within 2 - 3 years without a second job. id like to pay it off faster though. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure it will take dedication and hard work, but I bet you can do it! EOS 0 0 6 I think so. Im doing mturk for a second job right now. it helps some. i don' t know about getting another job. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been in your shoes and also feel that' s a good way to add a little extra income. It can really add up if left to built and used towards a specific goal. EOS 0 0 8 I agree 100%. Been spending it on new clothes and toiletries lately to stock up for the covid shutdown. the extra money helps alot. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It definitely can help. Perhaps you could have a separate way of using some of the money to go towards some of the other bills you would like to pay off? Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns. EOS 0 0 10 i currently do that. it' s hard to have the patience to pay it off. i hate having debt hanging over my head. i like to have nice things though and they cost money. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Yes, and I have found this can be a good way to provide for the extra luxuries we like, without taking away from money that' s used towards household bills. EOS 0 0 12 absolutely. i make sure all of my household bills are paid every month. i think it will get better once these debts are paid off. i needed a lot of new things at once since the old had worn out. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to use some of the scripts that can be added that allows you to catch hits that are hard to get on Mturk? They can be very helpful. Also, there are forums that have all kinds of useful information for workers. EOS 0 0 14 no i haven' t tried those yet. do i have to pay for those scripts? EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You might find it useful to do a little research and add them as extensions to Chrome or whatever browser you use. They are free and pretty simple to use. EOS 0 0 16 So I could make more money on mturk than I am now by using those? EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] They have helped me in being able to get a bit more extra income. The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It' s easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over. The forums can a large amount of help too. Perhaps try MTS. They also can show exactly how much you end up making per hour, filter by monetary amount of hits, etc. EOS 0 0 18 oh wow, thank ya! I' ll look into that. MTS is a script? Which script should I use? EOS 0 1 19 [Greeting] Of course, I hope it can be of use too you! One I use is Mechanical Turk Suite, which is an extension. I think you can look up as a search for extensions, scripts etc. Or Mturk forums and find out tons of help! EOS 0 0 20 Thank ya! I' ll check it out. EOS 0 1 21 [Greeting] You' re welcome! Best of Luck!
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear!
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 im feeling pretty sad today. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 4 0 3 its about me and my friend got fight for misunderstanding. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like your feelings are hurt over a misunderstanding you had with a friend is this correct?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Not so great - found out i' m losing my job in january. EOS 2 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] On no I am sorry to hear that! I know that must be tough. EOS 2 0 3 Yes I' m not even sure what steps to take right now. EOS 2 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea that can be difficult. Have you started looking for something else? EOS 2 0 5 Not yet, I' m not even sure where to begin. I have not looked for a job in 20 years. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way. EOS 2 0 7 I' ve tried calling the unemployment office to get some ideas but they do not answer their phones. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Or you could look for some side jobs like cleaning or organizing things until you find something more permanent. EOS 2 0 9 Yeah, i' m kinda old for that - LOL!!! My back would not hold up to that - and my salary wouldn' t be comparable. EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea it seems to be hard to get up with a lot of places at this time. Persistent is the key. EOS 2 0 11 Well I hear that their offices are closed and you have to do everything online - so not sure if they can even help me. EOS 2 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes i understand right now is a very bad time to find anything with so many places closed. Do you have any family or friends to reach out to for help if needed?
6 0 0 Hello, how are you?. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 6 0 2 I' m alright, honestly I' m feeling rather ashamed. The reason for that and the problem that I' m facing is that I' ve had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and I' m only 24 years old. Right now in my life I' m ready to seek help, but I' m having a lot of anxiety about it because I' m very worried about how others will judge me. I' m worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that I will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. I' m ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that I' ve made that have gotten me here and I guess my problem is that I just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that I can just finally make the step that I need so desperately and get help. EOS 6 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am in a good position to help you as I am in the same situation. Please know you are not alone. I would definitely recommend seeking help sooner rather than later! Hello? Are you wanting to talk? EOS 6 0 4 Yes of course I didn' t hear it go off, my apologies. I really appreciate that, it really is helpful knowing that I' m not the only one who feels this way. I really know that that' s what I need to do, and I am trying my best to get over my fears and just do it ya know. EOS 6 1 5 [Question] What level of alcohol consumption do you have? EOS 6 0 6 no matter how hard it seems, maybe it wont be when I actual do it. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Trust me everyone will be very sympathetic:). Everyone there will be in the same place. And the longer you keep drinking the more damage you are doing to yourself. EOS 6 0 8 and quite a bit, about half a gallon or more a day. And thank you, I really do appreciate your help. I know that and I know its time for me to better my life because its no way to live ya know. Id like to grow up and have a normal life(:. EOS 6 1 9 [Others] I am not sure how much half a gallon is to you... I am in the UK and I know it differs between the US and UK:) EOS 6 0 10 thank you, i do feel better about going now. I just dont know what to expect and it can be scary sometimes. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You will be treated with respect at all times. You might even find that you make some new friends:) Ping:) EOS 6 0 12 You' re right, and that' s what I probably need also is some friends who are in similar positions. EOS 6 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' d recommend online message boards. EOS 6 0 14 They' d understand my situation more, and be good influences. EOS 6 1 15 [Greeting] Anyway I hope I have been able to help and thank you for talking!
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:) EOS 2 0 7 It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am in the UK. It' s sort of a grey area... police won' t really do anything but you can' t buy it over the counter. EOS 2 0 9 One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I' m very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially. EOS 2 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot. The US seems to be really strict on it tho. EOS 2 0 11 It varies, state by state, depending on which party is governing. Which you of course have a version of in the UK. Mayoral elections were today yeah? EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] They were but I didn' t pay much attention:) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that' s all. EOS 2 0 13 Oh, well, I' m sorry to hear that. I think participation in local governance is actually the most achievable path for change, but perhaps how it' s structured where you are, it wouldn' t really matter much if you participated. I guess mayorals are only technically local, not like parliamentary elections. EOS 2 1 14 [Others] If I were in London or a major city I' d vote for Mayor. I am in a rural area and we don' t have one: D. I vote for local councillors tho. EOS 2 0 15 Oh, I take it to mean that you are anti - Khan? If you feel like you' d need to vote for mayor in London. EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I like Khan:) EOS 2 0 17 Jeremy Corbyn, no surrender? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I like him too lol. EOS 2 0 19 You sound like someone I' d like to smoke a spliff with In a moderated manner of course, in relevance to the topic I opened with. EOS 2 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] But I don' t get to vote for London mayor. Only if I were a London resident or nearby would I( sorry for tortured syntax) EOS 2 0 21 Prescriptive grammar is fascism, use whatever words in whatever order you like. Ironic given that I just watched My Fair Lady the other day. EOS 2 1 22 [Self-disclosure] Haha I don' t indulge these days, except for once in a blue moon: P.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Nice to meet you Jim, I am doing well. Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 3 I really appreciate your time Yes. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What is on your mind? EOS 0 0 5 I have been retired for over 2 years and would like to return to the workforce, part - ti me. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are thinking of going back to work? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, It would help us greatly. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have the right idea already.
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you doing? EOS 1 0 1 Hi, I' m ok. How are you? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] Not bad, it' s a peaceful night. Anything in particular you' d like to talk about? EOS 1 0 3 That' s great. My job refused my request to continue to work from home. So I was pretty much forced to go into a school where the cases are growing. EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I imagine that' s very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being? EOS 1 0 5 Just to make sure I' m wearing my mask, washing my hands, and social distancing. Which is not enough. There are more and more teachers getting infected and I just feel it a matter of time before it my turn.. I fear that I will bring this home to my family and I will not survive it. I have pre existing conditions. EOS 1 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry that you' re having to deal with such stressful circumstances. You can only control what you can control. Have you discussed these concerns with the school and explained the preexisting conditions? I get it though. It' s scary for everyone at this point. EOS 1 0 7 Yes I have explained to my principal, my team, and got a note from my Rheumatologist. EOS 1 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems to me that they should take that information into consideration. EOS 1 0 9 I feel that way too. I was told it for the best interest of the school that I am there I do not have student in my classroom but I' m forced to help out around the school with students and staff. Teachers are not cared about its just about pleasing the parents it crazy. I can' t quit because there not much to go into now. EOS 1 1 10 [Question] Is there someone else you could go to about this? Besides whoever you' ve already attempted to discuss it with? Yeah you' re right. Covid has been a mess for everyone and affected us in so many ways that e could' ve never prepared for. EOS 1 0 11 I' ve tried contacting HR a few times but I have never received a call back, or my emails answered. EOS 1 1 12 [Others] I mean all you can do is try your best to stay safe but I would continue to reach out to people higher up and see about getting something done. They probably get a lot of calls and emails right now because of everything going on but I would keep trying. EOS 1 0 13 Very true. I' m going to keep trying. Thanks for talking with me letting out what I feel has made me feel a little better. EOS 1 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Thank you for talking with me too! I hope it has helped some. At least you know you' re not alone...
4 0 0 i cant go back to uni due to finacial issue. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Good afternoon. How may I assist you? EOS 4 0 2 good afternnon. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] What is unit? Are talking school.
0 0 0 Hello my situation is that I' m facing an enormous amount of academic pressure. EOS 0 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello. Academic work can be overwhelming at times. I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though. Could you tell me what the issue is in particular? EOS 0 0 2 It' s just a huge amount of work that I' m struggling with and a ton of exams and they give me a lot of anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming. Make sure that you try to be as prepared as you can. When you feel capable of doing well on said exams, you will feel a lot less pressure. EOS 0 0 4 Do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though? EOS 0 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have an academic councelor you can talk to? EOS 0 0 6 yes it' s all virtual though. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well at least is something. I am sure talking to someone who might be able to guide you academically will be a significant relief.. EOS 0 0 8 That is a good idea. Do you personally recommend anything on how to balance my schedule and still be able to have my time to do other things? EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] When I was at college, I usually aimed at 2 hours of studying everyday(+ homework) and I also aimed to have at least 2 hours of leisure time. EOS 0 0 10 I see, and how were you able to maintain a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep and healthy eating habits during college? EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I honestly didn' t eat very healthy. If you live with your parents, I think a proper nutrition is easier. I usually slept around 7 hours each night. I picked most of my classes on the afternoon, worked out in the mornings. EOS 0 0 12 okay i understand, and what do you suggest for when you do poorly on an exam that you studied so hard for, how do you keep yourself from feeling down? EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest talking to the professor or an academic advisor to explore strategies that could help you improve.
3 1 0 [Question] hi how' s it going today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you? EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future? EOS 3 0 5 Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it' s true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online? EOS 3 0 7 Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression. EOS 3 0 9 How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] the" little black rain cloud" people? LOL I try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it' s our first. EOS 3 0 11 Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] While there is a lot to focus on that is just awful, it has really helped me to look back to the spanish flue of 1918. that pandemic was followed byt he roaring 20s. EOS 3 0 13 I know people thinking the country will collapse soon. Hard to deal with them. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The doomsday people are always around. remeber they mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012. EOS 3 0 15 I have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. Especially during the holidays. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] are you familiar with Mr. Rogers' story about looking for the helpers when things go bad? EOS 3 0 17 No but I did love that show as a kid. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Family is hard! So many strong emotions and opinions that aren' t always helpful. anyone in particular for you?
1 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How may I help you today? EOS 1 0 1 hi. I am stressed with my 25 year old moved back from NYC.. My boyfriend and I have a home and my son does not like him. EOS 1 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that i can understand how you must be feeling. Why does your son not like your boyfriend?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 I' m good. How about you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Very little to complain about today. What brings you here? EOS 3 0 3 Just want to talk some random stuff basically just want a companion. EOS 3 1 4 [Others] How' s the weather where you are? EOS 3 0 5 Still pretty cold and dry in here, how about there? EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Exactly the same. What are you doing to stay warm? EOS 3 0 7 Just in my long pajamas with heater. I don' t really know what to do anymore, I am just lazy on everything. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well you' re resourceful at staying warm, at least. You mentioned wanting a companion, are you living alone? EOS 3 0 9 not really I' m living with my family but I don' t really talk to them anymore I' m just in my room all day. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Is it the stress of the pandemic getting to you& your family, or something else? EOS 3 0 11 It' s something else. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Can you share? EOS 3 0 13 Just a fight from years ago and I decided to not talk to them anymore.. EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] That' s completely your decision, but it can bring us down at times. What are you doing to stay positive during these crazy times in the world? I know you mentioned feeling lazy. Sometimes I make a list of things in the morning that I want to accomplish. Even if I get one done, it' s a win.: -) EOS 3 0 15 I talk to my friends online, play games, watch movies, etc. I know, I should find a productive hobby. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] A hobby could be another outlet for you in addition to talking to your friends online. You don' t have to put too much pressure on yourself for it to be productive. What hobby ideas do you have? EOS 3 0 17 Like painting or learn new skills online like coding, anything that can improve my human capital. EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What a great idea about learning new skills. It would be a great investment of your time, as well as improve your human capital. Win - win. Can you make a plan to research some places where you can sign - up for a coding class? Maybe research the next few days, and commit to starting in the nest 2 - 3 weeks? You would also meet others like yourself online also trying to learn a new skill.
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better.
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic? EOS 0 0 16 so literally, I only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. I only started a new work in September, and it' s not much( about two days a week), so I can' t comment too much about that. It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps. EOS 0 0 18 so I get nervous in general when I am at work but I do my work just the same. May not be able to work as well because I have to breathe through a mask, and some other small difficulties. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is good that you can continue to do your work the same. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you for all the positive messages so far and in understanding and sympathizing with me.. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] Is there anything else I should know about how the pandemic is affecting you? EOS 0 0 22 pretty much. If anything, it' s my academic life at home that has changed not so well.. EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Are you a student? EOS 0 0 24 yes, I take online courses and I tend to procrastinate a lot more and get distracted as I find myself more and more at home. Just getting carried away and now have impending deadlines.. I can get through it but it has had a toll on my productivity.. I was just taking my sweet time with it and that wasn' t good. EOS 0 1 25 [Self-disclosure] I am also a student and am not motivated to do school work at home, so I completely understand. I am sure you are successful at school! Having a planner may keep you organized and on - task. Dedicating a certain time frame and area for school work might help, as well.. EOS 0 0 26 Because prior to the pandemic, I was pretty regimented with set schedules and can clear my mind with work - outs and going to the gym and movies, but now it' s not that simple.. EOS 0 1 27 [Question] Is there anything else I can help you with?
5 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. I' m here to listen. EOS 5 0 1 The unemployment office is overwhelmed and I' m overwhelmed trying to help my family member. EOS 5 1 2 [Providing Suggestions or Information] These days all of us have this situation. I can assure you that your family can understand it. How about an online job? EOS 5 0 3 Yes, it just very frustrating. My family member has taken another restaurant job only to lose it again for the same reasons, COVID. They have been going to temp services also. EOS 5 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I also worked in a coffee house and it has been closed for this damn virus. I feel sad too. But we should go on. EOS 5 0 5 The job center' s can only help so much. And if they don' t have internet skills, then online jobs will help. EOS 5 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] This sounds good. EOS 5 0 7 So this family member gave up their apartment, moved back in with family, still fighting unemployment and going to food banks. It' s crazy. They are doing what they can but when we talk about it, it' s hard to believe in these modern times we are in such a mess. EOS 5 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I wish this virus ends soon. But believe me everyone have similar situation these days. Did they try any online job? EOS 5 0 9 No online computer skills, but they now learned where to get some basic training. EOS 5 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] This sounds good. Wish to learn soon. I am mourning for my grandpa and my uncle that they gone for the Covid. You should be happy that you have them. EOS 5 0 11 I' m so sorry. I feel a little better talking about this. My family tries to help other family members but we can only do so much. That' s when I got frustrated( helping them with unemployment) EOS 5 1 12 [Others] Money is not always a big deal honey. EOS 5 0 13 Yes, there is more to life than money. Unfortunately$ is needed for the basics. Thanks for listening and guidance. EOS 5 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Of course but having them by your side is a gift. your welcome. I wish I could help a little. EOS 5 0 15 Yes and I wish you a good thanksgiving holiday. EOS 5 1 16 [Greeting] You too.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that? EOS 0 0 21 being on the board gives me perks. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit? EOS 0 0 23 yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there' s an element of mutual manipulation. EOS 0 0 25 yes. EOS 0 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are definitely not the only person to feel this way! EOS 0 0 27 it' s a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power.. what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board. EOS 0 0 29 i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment. EOS 0 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] But that is rather manipulative of you. EOS 0 0 31 if you were me you would forget about him and the board. EOS 0 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I definitely would do that. EOS 0 0 33 thing is he is encouraging me to be like that. cuz it helps him too. okay. i' ll try to lay low and walk away from it. EOS 0 1 34 [Others] I think it' s time for a clear severance. Do you have any other people you are interested in? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 35 yes but it' s less than before cuz of Covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this - if that makes sense. EOS 0 1 36 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah I hear you. You feel that your options are rather more limited than previously because of the lockdown? EOS 0 0 37 yes. EOS 0 1 38 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is something I believe that most of us are feeling right now so I sympathise. EOS 0 0 39 true. i just have to be strong about it with him. even if he likes me i don' t think it' s a healthy relationship. i slept with one of his friends and the other one wanted to sleep with me too. EOS 0 1 40 [Reflection of feelings] I can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be. Is he aware that this happened? EOS 0 0 41 yes when it comes down to it. he suspected it happened. his friend asked the one i slept with if it was true. he denied it. so i think he suspected it. EOS 0 1 42 [Question] Do you feel guilty about this? EOS 0 0 43 now that im talking to him i do a little. it felt good at the time like i was getting back at him. you can tell this is a very twisted situation. EOS 0 1 44 [Question] Do you feel that you want to get revenge on him? EOS 0 0 45 not really. i just felt that if he stayed with me i wouldn' t have slept with his friend and almost did with his other one. EOS 0 1 46 [Others] I am not sure what to say that will help your problem and give you closure.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy.

0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 hello. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 0 0 3 I need ways alleviate stress while studying. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there. EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck. EOS 0 0 7 How did you push past that job? EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work. EOS 0 0 9 Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career? EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too. EOS 0 0 11 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Can you give me some more details? EOS 0 0 13 I just find the work mundane and way too remedial. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable. EOS 0 0 15 did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job? EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have you a few, there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit. EOS 0 0 17 what types of skill can I gain online? EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Indeed is one of the better ones to look for jobs, honestly I would suggest looking at jobs that you normally wouldn' t and see what kind of qualifications they need and see if you can get that done online.
3 0 0 hello. how are you today? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today?. EOS 3 0 2 a bit sad. more depressed. its just i keep getting benched at work. i' m not really sure what do to.* to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset. EOS 3 0 4 i' m not really sure what i' m doing wrong. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though. EOS 3 0 6 what can i do though? EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there' s anything going on? EOS 3 0 8 hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Of course! That sounds frustrating to not know why it' s happening and not have the opportunity to ask. EOS 3 0 10 yes... hrm. that may work. how can i stop being depressed all the time though.. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' ve also had bosses that are infrequently in the office and make getting good information hard. EOS 3 0 12 how did you fix the issue? i work at home and its like just trying to reach out - they are always busy. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren' t always a reflection of us or how we' re performing. EOS 3 0 14 this whole covid thing has me scrambling to talk to a live person. EOS 3 1 15 [Others] I can imagine! EOS 3 0 16 ok, so just keep pushing and getting good work done? EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I was in a physical office when I had this problem, but the boss rotated between offices. It was hard to wait, but I just kept my head down until the next time she was available. That' s what I did. EOS 3 0 18 maybe i can try that. thank you. i' ll give it a shot. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think reminding yourself that if there was a problem with your work they would be seeking YOU out, and not the other way around. EOS 3 0 20 hrm... that' s a good point! i hadn' t thought of it that way. EOS 3 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] Hopefully that mindset can help you stay positive until you have the chance to speak with them, instead of worrying about what you' ve done wrong. That anxiety feels like what is keeping you down? EOS 3 0 22 i think that will work. it maybe what' s keeping me down. i' ll try yoga too. I' ll give it a shot and just talk with him when i see him online next time. he isn' t online that often because we have 2 separate computers each for our work. well... i hope you have a wonderful night! thank you for all your help! EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I really hope that helps keep you afloat until you can get some real answers. Worrying about what - ifs is harder than just knowing what' s goiong on! EOS 3 0 24 yes i agree. EOS 3 1 25 [Greeting] I hope you feel better soon and are able to clear it up! EOS 3 0 26 thank you for your help! me too. i' ll try what you have suggested and see if that doesn' t work out well. who knows, maybe it just my project that i' m on. EOS 3 1 27 [Greeting] Have a good night!

EOS 1 0 3 really angry at my friend. EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] can you tell me what happened so that i can understand? EOS 1 0 5 i told him a secret about my self in private and he played a stupid pranks that reveals it to other people i don' t like. EOS 1 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s ok dear. did you asked him why he did that? EOS 1 0 7 he said he was drunk. EOS 1 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] just remember, yesterday is gone. there is really nothing you can do about the situation. you better keep your distance from that particular person. EOS 1 0 9 ok. and i already keep my distance from him. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] learn from your mistake and don' t do it again dear. EOS 1 0 11 yes i won' t. funny thing is he didn' t remember what he did that night. EOS 1 1 12 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah. we can' t control others. right? EOS 1 0 13 absolutely. EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes. it totally depends on how mature the person is. just forgive him and keep in mind for next time whether you should share something with him or not. EOS 1 0 15 i am definitely sharing my secret anyone ever again. EOS 1 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes. let it go and don' t confuse it again. trust me. you became stronger by this. EOS 1 0 17 i hope so. EOS 1 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] yes. don' t think much and sleep soon dear. EOS 1 0 19 i will sleep soon. it' s nice getting the feeling out. EOS 1 1 20 [Greeting] i am happy to hear this dear. EOS 1 0 21 thanks for the chat. EOS 1 1 22 [Greeting] welcome dear. EOS 1 0 23 take care. EOS 1 1 24 [Greeting] you too dear.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 2 Feeling depressed as usual. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 4 Everything. Life. It' s awful. How many years do you really need to stop enjoying this place. Ya know what I mean. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand, but just to make sure I know what is going on fully, you are depressed in general and don' t know how to get through it.. EOS 3 0 6 I would say that is fairly accurate. Often times, I wish an asteroid would come down and begin the apocolypse.. Something to break up the routine. Don' t you find life utterly boring and repetitive?. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Just from these few messages, I can tell you are extremely upset about this.. I have had problems in the past with depression as well, I used to have severe anxiety as well.. EOS 3 0 8 Sorry to hear that. Anxiety and depression are dual bladed sword of badness. Really bad mixture. I never struggled too much with anxiety.. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It was tough. Have you thought about consulting a psychological professional to help with this issue? I did when I was going through my depression and it really helped.. EOS 3 0 10 NO! I would never do that. I' m already on anti depressants. That didn' t help at all.. I just don' t understand why people like life enough to make more people! It is madness! EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I didn' t like the meds that they gave me either, however I felt that talking to someone helped me a great deal.. EOS 3 0 12 Well, I' m glad it helped you. I' m not just saying that. Being depressed is awful.. What did it do for you? How so? EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] It was good to be able to talk to an objective third party about what was going on. It allowed me to get my feelings out without the threat of being judges or harrassed.. EOS 3 0 14 I understand. Well, I appreciate your time and advice. I just don' t feel like you and I are understanding each other very well, though. Anyway, you made your bonus. I appreciate you trying to help me, though. We got to talk for another 4 minutes though. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to focus on more of your hobbies in order to get your mind off of things? EOS 3 0 16 I used to have more hobbies. Now, I' m not so motivated to do much of anything anymore. I used to play instruments. I like hiking a little, but it is winter now. So... I can' t even do that. Plus... I have to travel really far to do that because there is nothing to hike that is very close. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Why did you stop playing insturments? EOS 3 0 18 I just lost interest. I' m losing interest in everything, man. I think it' s time for my heart to give out and make space for the new, ya know. Cross my fingers at least. Dying in your sleep would be best. Wouldn' t that be nice? You just drift off after your heart stops in a dream? EOS 3 1 19 [Others] I certainly hope you don' t do that! EOS 3 0 20 Well, that' s nice. You are a nice person.. Anyway, You finally earned your 3 dollars and 50 cents. You tried. I appreciate it.. Goodbye fellow mturker slave. EOS 3 1 21 [Others] I apologize that I wasn' t able to make you feel any better. EOS 3 0 22 NO! DOnt you dare. It is all k. goodbye. EOS 3 1 23 [Others] Have a wonderful evening!
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, I' m here to listen. What' s going on? EOS 0 0 1 Thank you. I' ve lost my job and I' m very nervous about the future. As a result I am having a hard time sleeping. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Wow, that' s very hard. I would be anxious too.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how is your day today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. Not so good. I lost my cat recently. It surely feels... overwhelming at times. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] That is a very hard thing to be going through where you very close to your cat? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, I had her for 11 years. She died of natural causes. I lived alone with her. The house feels extremely empty now... EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am very sorry to hear that i have also lost a pet earlier this year his name was fish and was only 3 years old he unfortunately passed due to liver cancer. It was a very trying experience but slowly the pain of his passing has got a little bit easier. Have you tried talking about this loss to friends of family?
6 0 0 Hello, how are you?. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 6 0 2 I' m alright, honestly I' m feeling rather ashamed. The reason for that and the problem that I' m facing is that I' ve had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and I' m only 24 years old. Right now in my life I' m ready to seek help, but I' m having a lot of anxiety about it because I' m very worried about how others will judge me. I' m worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that I will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. I' m ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that I' ve made that have gotten me here and I guess my problem is that I just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that I can just finally make the step that I need so desperately and get help. EOS 6 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am in a good position to help you as I am in the same situation. Please know you are not alone. I would definitely recommend seeking help sooner rather than later! Hello? Are you wanting to talk? EOS 6 0 4 Yes of course I didn' t hear it go off, my apologies. I really appreciate that, it really is helpful knowing that I' m not the only one who feels this way. I really know that that' s what I need to do, and I am trying my best to get over my fears and just do it ya know. EOS 6 1 5 [Question] What level of alcohol consumption do you have? EOS 6 0 6 no matter how hard it seems, maybe it wont be when I actual do it. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Trust me everyone will be very sympathetic:). Everyone there will be in the same place. And the longer you keep drinking the more damage you are doing to yourself. EOS 6 0 8 and quite a bit, about half a gallon or more a day. And thank you, I really do appreciate your help. I know that and I know its time for me to better my life because its no way to live ya know. Id like to grow up and have a normal life(:. EOS 6 1 9 [Others] I am not sure how much half a gallon is to you... I am in the UK and I know it differs between the US and UK:) EOS 6 0 10 thank you, i do feel better about going now. I just dont know what to expect and it can be scary sometimes. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You will be treated with respect at all times.

0 0 0 Hi. Hello, can you help me? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I hope so. What kind of problem are you having? EOS 0 0 2 I am really struggling with my studies at the moment, I am so anxious that I keep putting off my essays and worrying all the time. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are a student who is having trouble. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, I am a mature student and struggling with my course. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand how you feel. I was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school. It is very understandable that you are feeling stressed, especially with the pandemic and other issues happening. EOS 0 0 6 yes, the pandemic is making it worse. I am working as well so I am struggling juggling them all and running a house. I just don' t know how to get back on track with my studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about putting together a schedule to help you manage your time? EOS 0 0 8 How would I go about that? EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you go online, there are different templates for students. One would be a time management template where you fill in the blocks of different times of the day. Also, do you know any of your classmates that you could email or text for support? EOS 0 0 10 okay, I can see the sense in that. Have you used them before, if so would you recommend putting everything on there or keeping it flexible? I do have a couple that i could contact, I' ve been feeling really embarrassed to contact them, like they might think I am being silly. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] To start, fill in one week to see what all activities you have to do. Set aside specific time for doing your schoolwork. Try and stick with the schedule. EOS 0 0 12 Okay, one week doesn' t seem too scary. I could colour coordinate it, I like things in colour. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] . I would try it.

3 0 0 hello. anyone there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with today? EOS 3 0 2 am not fine. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What is it that is making you feel this way? EOS 3 0 4 i was cheated on severally, and it resulted me to end the relationship. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you had to deal with a partner recently cheating and a breakup, is this right? EOS 3 0 6 yes thats it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this has been stressful for you and you are trying to figure out how to move on from this. EOS 3 0 8 exactly, i can tend to focus because i have given so much time and affection, i never thought i would be called the fool after everything i did. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is incredibly difficult to get something like this off your mind and it seems like you are trying your best to move forward with your life. EOS 3 0 10 i want to move on but i dont know how, i tried to but i just cant. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I have been through this, I learned how to keep myself busy and do things that I enjoy to occupy my mind and let time heal those wounds. EOS 3 0 12 i think you right, maybe i should renew my netflix sub, since i find great interest in movies so as to get some positive vibes and think less of this whole situation. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Science shows that during a breakup sometimes you romanticize the relationship and view it as better than it actually was and missing something that wasn' t as good as you thought. EOS 3 0 14 yh thats true. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] My suggestion is to focus on new hobbies, spend time with friends and family when possible, if you have work you can do in the mean time, if you like to exercise or go outside, all of this is a helpful tool. EOS 3 0 16 this is really helpful, i really do appreciate this suggestions. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] Don' t be afraid to express your feelings and confide in others about your emotions and mental health. It is still a loss and something you should feel comfortable grieving.

1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave? EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad. EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more. I feel that everyone must know that I' ve been dumped and be laughing at me. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time. EOS 1 0 10 I did not really have any choice though. I do not see any future for myself now that we are separated. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] do you know brene brown and her work. EOS 1 0 12 No I do not, who is that? EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her TED talk and there' s a great youtube video on empathy. EOS 1 0 14 Thank you, I will. Right now I really need some sort of emotional support. I feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i bring her up because what i sounds like is that you are feeling embarrassed because your partner made a choice that wasn' t you. in reality the choice they made wasn' t about you, it was about them. EOS 1 0 16 It is not so much that - it is that I feel that I dedicated the majority of my adult life to this relationship and now there is nothing left. EOS 1 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are left and you are enough. even if you dont feel like it right now you are enough.

EOS 4 0 5 I price one of the books, Amazon said 1000. yes. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] So you have lost a book that is worth a thousand dollars? I can imagine you are feeling really bad about that. EOS 4 0 7 where will I g et almost 3 thousand dollars. It is too painful. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I do not know.. have you considered taking an extra job on the side? EOS 4 0 9 yes, i do. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to get help with finding the books? Someone could have handed them in. EOS 4 0 11 school, should just give me enough time to find the books. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you have any idea of where you lost them? EOS 4 0 13 allow me to clear myself later, it is a fucking thing. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] I am sorry, I do not understand what you mean. EOS 4 0 15 I am trying to find that out, I packed them inside one bag, may be someone carried the bag or I misplace them. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Try not to worry, it is entirely possible that someone has found them and handed them in to the authorities. You might still get them back! EOS 4 0 17 i need enough time to look for the books, but school is not ready to listen to me. EOS 4 1 18 [Question] That is really not fair of them. Is there a higher authority you can take your case to? EOS 4 0 19 you are right. EOS 4 1 20 [Self-disclosure] They really should be doing more to help you. I know how frustrating it feels to lose something valuable. I did lose a really expensive ring one time but I got it back a week later. EOS 4 0 21 yes, it is fuck giving me headache. EOS 4 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand why it would be! Please try not to worry, all is not lost.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello how are you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I am good, how are you? EOS 3 0 3 I am doing well just dealing with some problems with my friends. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I' m sorry, what type of problems are you having? EOS 3 0 5 Friends not being there for me when I need emotional support. They also do not pay for their stuff when we go out to eat or go to the bar as well.

EOS 3 0 7 Yes that is exactly it. Just sucks not having that emotional support. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] I completely understand what you are feeling. Have you tried to talk to your friends about your concerns? It helps to clear the air and make sure everyone understands everyone elses perspective. EOS 3 0 9 I have and it seems that they just tell me what I would like to hear! It sucks when I am always there for them when they need me but they cannot do the same. EOS 3 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have had the same problems in the past with some friends not being there for me when I need it, so I completely understand where you' re coming from.. EOS 3 0 11 It' s good to know that I am not the only one going through this. What is your advice from experience with this? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have anyone else to talk to about what you' re going through? It also helps a lot of the time to talk to an objective 3rd part to help give you some advice on what they think you should do..

EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you? EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future? EOS 3 0 5 Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it' s true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online? EOS 3 0 7 Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression. EOS 3 0 9 How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] the" little black rain cloud" people? LOL I try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it' s our first. EOS 3 0 11 Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] While there is a lot to focus on that is just awful, it has really helped me to look back to the spanish flue of 1918. that pandemic was followed byt he roaring 20s. EOS 3 0 13 I know people thinking the country will collapse soon. Hard to deal with them. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The doomsday people are always around. remeber they mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012. EOS 3 0 15 I have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. Especially during the holidays. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] are you familiar with Mr. Rogers' story about looking for the helpers when things go bad?

3 0 0 I am so stressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi, what' s going on? EOS 3 0 2 I have a college course in the evening, but I cannot concentrate while distance learning. I am expected to watch the instructor do excel on a tiny phone screen and follow along. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oooff that sounds brutal... especially the excel part! do you have a bigger screen you can use? EOS 3 0 4 It is stressful. I am able to pull up zoom on my laptop, but it is almost more cumbersome because I must switch back and forth. I have to also manipulate an excel as well as watch the instructor. My colleagues in the class are annoying, because they do not know how to use mute correctly. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have access to a second screen or have the ability to stream the class on your tv through chromecast or something? EOS 3 0 6 I don' t have a second screen, but I do have a large TV. I may be able to hook it up via HDMI. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The mute thing is horrible. I have no ideas for that. hahah. I' m looking for help with that too! Yeah try the HDMI hook up you can sometimes find cheap attachements on amazon if you don' t have the right connections. EOS 3 0 8 Sometimes I get really anxious. My ears will be pounding and I feel like I can' t hear anything. It is worse when using in ears, because it' s like all I can hear is my heartbeat. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yeah if you stream it on your tv, you won' t have to wear headphones... that way you can control the volume better too. EOS 3 0 10 That sounds like a great idea. Have you had any weird technological solutions to help you through distance learning? EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' m not really doing any distance learning right now. Just working from home and coincidentally most of my work uses excel. I have constant virtual meetings where I have to show people things via excel. It' s pretty tough but I found if I use multiple monitors it makes things easier.

EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I am having trouble figuring out how to handel a situation with a friend. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah, can you give me a few more details? I am sure I will be able to help/ EOS 0 0 5 Her husband was justshot and kiled over a drug deal. He was high on drugs at the time. My dayghter and his daughter are good friends and we carpool with them every day. He was often the driver not my friend. Was he high when he was driving my daughter arround? Did my friend know he was on drugs? EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow that is a tough one - I can see why you would be concerned about it. At least, though, you can be assured that she is safe and is never going to come to any harm as a result of his driving now. EOS 0 0 7 Agreed but it is hard to not be suspicious that the mom knew something about hi actions. Yet I feel horrible that she lost her husband. EOS 0 1 8 [Others] I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it:( EOS 0 0 9 I know. I am trying to be supportive and help her with her kids but a part of me is still anxious that she may have played me. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] People can hold values that to other people seem strange. She might not have considered it wrong to be driving on drugs, even though it is. EOS 0 0 11 Very true. I really never even considered that! EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would not make it acceptable though! EOS 0 0 13 No, absolutely not! But I never looked at it that way. EOS 0 1 14 [Others] At least you can feel relieved that your daughter is safe now:) EOS 0 0 15 Yes. I am very relieved. He was recently in a car accident before he died. Luckily no one was hurt and the girls were not in the car! He totaled his brand new truck though. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think the best you can do right now is just be there for your friend when she wants to talk.

Have you offered to stay later to make up the work? EOS 0 0 6 No. But that is a good idea. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe your boss can compromise with you. It' s worth a shot! EOS 0 0 8 It' s a very competitive office and I don' t want to look weak. EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] You sound like you care about this job and that is a valuable asset in a an employee. EOS 0 0 10 I do. I hope I can explain the situation clearly and offer to make up time by staying late. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand. Is there a coworker or mentor that maybe you can talk to? EOS 0 0 12 I will reach out to HR. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a great idea! EOS 0 0 14 Thank you. You have been very helpful and uplifting. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Also review your employee handbook and see if there are things you can do to negotiate with HR or your boss in regards to your hours. Always best to come prepared:) EOS 0 0 16 My anxiety is disappearing with the suggestions you have offered. EOS 0 1 17 [Question] That' s great! I am happy I could help you during such a difficult time. How long have you been at the job?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 3 0 2 well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. My life is done now. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband. EOS 3 0 4 well, I cannot say it is a new start when I will be 90 in March. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Then you' ve definitely got a lot going for you if you' re 90! EOS 3 0 6 Had. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] Why did he leave you?
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how can i help you today? EOS 0 0 2 Just feeling sad. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Tell me more. What has you feeling sad? EOS 0 0 4 Not being able to leave the house with Covid. plus my hours were cut at work. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I am also going through the same. I have not left my house in weeks. While I am able to work from home, my hours were also cut. What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time? EOS 0 0 6 Yes it sucks. I live alone now so there really hard sometimes. I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos. Nothing productive. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it' s not the same as face to face. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I have one close friend that I talk to every now and then. Its not like it use to be. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That' s still a win. EOS 0 0 10 We used to be able to go out and have a few beers together.. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. Keep that connection. It' s not going to be the same due to the circumstances. But at least you are seeking to keep that connection, and that is a good thing. EOS 0 0 12 I hope that this vaccine thing is reason and we can get back to the norm.. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it' s not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest. EOS 0 0 14 Good idea.. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well. But I am hoping they get it right, and not just rush to get something out there that may or may not work. EOS 0 0 16 I like to do home repairs. Maybe I can find a group for that. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway. EOS 0 0 18 Do you use any other social media for connecting with new people. EOS 0 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I use Facebook, Instagram, and sometimes TikTok. You should do mini videos on easy things to DIY on TikTok. EOS 0 0 20 True. I have to change out a few old style electrical plugs. Maybe I can do something on that? EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] right! That is a great idea! EOS 0 0 22 I saw a few TikTok videos but never post a video. Is it hard to post on there? EOS 0 1 23 [Self-disclosure] not really. what i do is record the video beforehand, and then upload it. EOS 0 0 24 Oh. Okay. EOS 0 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] But you can also record it straight to the app. You can also do the same on SnapChat. EOS 0 0 26 I noticed all the videos are so short. I think I will have to use YouTube for a longer video? I never used SnapChat. Is that the one disappears after some time.? EOS 0 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, if you are doing longer videos, I recommend YouTube. What you can do, is do a short clip on TikToc and then in that clip instruct viewers to follow your YouTube Channel. Yes Snap Chat dissappears after it' s viewed. EOS 0 0 28 Wow. Thanks for all the great information. EOS 0 1 29 [Others] Sure, my pleasure!

What' s going on at work that' s making you upset? EOS 1 0 3 i think boss hate me. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That can be very uncomfortable. Are there reason you feel that way? EOS 1 0 5 nothing i do pleases the man. all he does is complain. EOS 1 1 6 [Question] Ugh - is he like this with everyone else, too - or do you think it' s just directed at you? EOS 1 0 7 i think its directed to me. EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Can you give an example and then maybe we can replay it a different way? EOS 1 0 9 if am asked to complete a task, i do complete them and make sure no mistake was made, if he will evaluate the task he always sees fault in what i do. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hmm= that is frustrating. Can you sit with him and go over each section that he finds fault with and ask how he would have done it?
3 1 0 [Question] hi how' s it going today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you? EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future? EOS 3 0 5 Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it' s true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online? EOS 3 0 7 Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression. EOS 3 0 9 How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] the" little black rain cloud" people? LOL I try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it' s our first. EOS 3 0 11 Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] While there is a lot to focus on that is just awful, it has really helped me to look back to the spanish flue of 1918. that pandemic was followed byt he roaring 20s. EOS 3 0 13 I know people thinking the country will collapse soon. Hard to deal with them. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The doomsday people are always around. remeber they mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012. EOS 3 0 15 I have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. Especially during the holidays. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] are you familiar with Mr. Rogers' story about looking for the helpers when things go bad? EOS 3 0 17 No but I did love that show as a kid. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Family is hard! So many strong emotions and opinions that aren' t always helpful. anyone in particular for you? EOS 3 0 19 My dad and my GF' s dad both have their own opinons on things. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people. EOS 3 0 21 Yes. I also don' t feel like the world will decent into madness, but they do not believe it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] oooh, that' s hard. are you living at home with your dad? as a mom, i can tell you that the unknown for your children is scary. often fear and lack of control come out sideways. EOS 3 0 23 No but near him and take care of him. EOS 3 1 24 [Self-disclosure] that' s really nice of you. i' m 800+ miles away from my parents. EOS 3 0 25 That is good and bad. I think it is good to talk about though I do feel a little better thank you. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if i can suggest something that might help - brene brown, a leadership coach and researcher has a great TED talk about shame and vunerability and a CUTE cartoon animal video on yourtube about empathy.
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, what brings you to bring the seeker? EOS 6 0 1 I feel upset with myself over my situation. Did you read it? EOS 6 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I did not see it. What is your situation? I am here to listen. EOS 6 0 3 I feel ashamed of my depression symptoms. I feel other people are ashamed of me. EOS 6 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how? EOS 6 0 5 I just can' t live reguarly life like" healthy" people do and they notice my symptoms. They don' t understand how your mind can be your enemy. EOS 6 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are saying that you can' t live regularly and people don' t understand that your mind isn' t working in your favor. Is that right? Can you tell me what you mean by your mind being your enemy? EOS 6 0 7 Like I have no interest or motivation to do ANYTHING some days. Hard to even take care of my hygiene. My mind doesn' t care to do it even when it' s embarrasing for people to notice. EOS 6 1 8 [Greeting] That sounds very hard. I can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn' t want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself. What do you do to cope? EOS 6 0 9 stay away from mean people, stop tryiig to explain my symptoms to others who won' t get it. EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That makes sense why you would want to avoid doing these things, which is a good thing, but is there anything that you try to do that isn' t avoidance? Something that approaches something? EOS 6 0 11 I go to all my therapy appoints and try to participate. Thanks for your help. Have a good day. EOS 6 1 12 [Question] How do you feel about therapy? EOS 6 0 13 I have to go now. Bye. EOS 6 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is unfortunate, but I understand. We haven' t finished, the task, however, but I hope you feel better. EOS 6 0 15 I can stay a bit longer. I' m just tired. EOS 6 1 16 [Others] I think we just need 3 more responses each, let' s say. EOS 6 0 17 Thanks. EOS 6 1 18 [Question] Okay, so can you tell me how frequently you sleep? EOS 6 0 19 about 3 broken hours a night. EOS 6 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That sounds awful. I' m sorry. Have you tried researching or practicing any sleep hygiene? EOS 6 0 21 Yes, I know all the rules. My mind just wont rest. EOS 6 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Smoking and drinking alcohol can cause sleep problems before bed. Do you do those things? What troubles your rest, you think?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 hi. Could you please help?. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How are you tonight?. EOS 3 0 3 I am okay. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 3 0 5 I caught my gf texting another guy. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So from what I understand, you caught your significant other texting someone else.. EOS 3 0 7 yes right. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] What types of things was she texting him about? EOS 3 0 9 Asking about what he was doing later. What he likes to do for fun. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Just from the few messages we have sent, I can tell you are very anxious and upset about this situation.. EOS 3 0 11 yes for sure, i was so shocked and disappointed. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand this as I had issues with my ex fiancé texting other guys and cheating on me.. EOS 3 0 13 Oh no! thats horrible too. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know how hard a situation like this is, but I know you can get through it! EOS 3 0 15 Thanks so much! I think I can too. Thanks for sharing with me. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to have a conversation with her about it? EOS 3 0 17 No I feel like she should come to me about it since she was caught. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] What if she doesn' t know you caught her? EOS 3 0 19 I saw her do it. She didn' t really say a whole lot, she just left right afterwards. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think it would definitely help to talk to her about it, it is never good to let situations like this build up without being talked about.. EOS 3 0 21 That' s probably true, just a bit awkward. EOS 3 1 22 [Self-disclosure] I can definitely understand the awkwardness of the conversation, it was tough for me to have that conversation as well..
4 1 0 [Question] Hello there, can I help you with any today?* anything. I am happy to talk to you about any problem that you might be having? EOS 4 0 1 I am having such a difficult time today!!! EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you. EOS 4 0 3 I think that my boyfriend is cheating on me again!!! EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Are you saying that he has cheated on you before? That does not sound very promising.
0 0 0 Hello. Feeling low today. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 Hi, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Greeting] Doing good.. How are you? EOS 0 0 3 I' m feeling really anxious these days. I' m finding the COVID online learning experience to be too much for me at this time. I want to stop school, but I don' t think I can afford to. I need to get done with school. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand your frustration. All of us are challenged due to COVID. EOS 0 0 5 School was always hard. Now it' s gotten harder. I think a lot of people are stressed.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] How long are you doing the online school? EOS 0 0 7 Last semester and this semester. It feels like a lot longer though. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What are you missing most? Friends? EOS 0 0 9 A balance in life. I spend so much time online. I' m always staring at a screen. I would like to get aware from the computer. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] As the vaccination started, I believe we will be back to normal soon.. EOS 0 0 11 Yeah, I can' t wait for things to return to normal. Until then, I don' t know what I can do to feel normal. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I saw some of my friends hang out in zoom... having virtual drinks.. have you tried that? EOS 0 0 13 No, I haven' t. I thought it wouldn' t be the same as really hanging out. I don' t drink. I do like to play board games though. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It will not be same.. but better than being alone.. EOS 0 0 15 That' s true. I wanted to play board games online with some friends, but they weren' t interested. It' s not the same thing to play with strangers. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I have a group with my elementary school friends.. we hang out in zoom because we all are spread out across the globe.. some times.. it; s fun as we can share a lot of memories.. EOS 0 0 17 That' s great. I wish I had kept in touch with my friends from those days. I' m not really much for just socializing though. I like some kind of activity, like games. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Got you.. try to form a group on - line with the people you know.. at least until this CONVID thing is over.. EOS 0 0 19 Ok. Not really sure how to form a group. I want to reach out, but so many people are flaky. They makes plans then bail at the last minute.. EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] For sure you would find someone.. if you keep looking.. EOS 0 0 21 Ok. Will do. I' ll see what I can get done. Thanks for your help. EOS 0 1 22 [Greeting] you welcome. EOS 0 0 23 Have a good day! EOS 0 1 24 [Others] Could you please close the chat...
0 0 0 Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, what seems to be on your mind?. EOS 0 0 2 Friends and our relationships amongst one another. Two are arguing and I want to help both. We only can facetime each other because of Corona and it is taking a toll among our group. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I see. How long have your two friends been arguing? EOS 0 0 4 It has been around 4 months now. It started slowly and now has ramped up to where it' s exploding and causing discourse among us all. One of my friends told a secret to another acquaintance outside of our group. My friend is raging over this which she should. trust was broken. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like tempers are all running pretty hot for everyone right now, is that correct? EOS 0 0 6 I believe in forgiveness, and the friend that told is very remorseful How do I help them? EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Well, it sounds like you are in a tough spot since both your friends are so mad at each other.. Why do you think your one friends shared a secret they were supposed to keep? EOS 0 0 8 The acquaintance knew something of the secret because she had experienced this before. I think my friend was more - so trying to help my other friend, not betray her. She went outside the group but not for spitrful reasons i think. EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I think I understand. Sometimes we accidentally hurt the people we love when we are trying to help. EOS 0 0 10 I want one friend to know that the other was trying to hel and nothurt, but did not think clearly when deciding where to get help from. How do I make her understand this? EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it is great that you want to actively help, it says a lot about you. EOS 0 0 12 Thanks! What should I say to her? EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes the best way to help someone understand is to give them a little time and space. Trying to force someone to understand doesn' t always work. EOS 0 0 14 I think this can be good because she IS a little hot headed. Goos advice! I think I will tell everyonr in our circle to fall back and let her come to us when she is ready. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could also try talking to your hurt friend like this and ask her if she thinks the other friend truly meant to hurt her. I bet she knows that wasn' t the case. I bet you guys will all be friends again in no time. EOS 0 0 16 She knws this but nonetheless feels violated. I think your first piece of advice is great though. I will use this and Thanks! Have a good one. EOS 0 1 17 [Others] You as well!
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hi. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] how are you? EOS 3 0 3 Not too good sadly:/ EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I' m sorry. what' s going on?
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state. EOS 0 0 6 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well. EOS 0 0 8 Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing( which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all. I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out. EOS 0 0 10 What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job: it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. Working there would be ministry, not typical work. And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, that' s a big deal. i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it. EOS 0 0 12 Thank you. I believe there are three things in my favor: I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current( related) job fifteen years ago. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] even by working there, you will surely meet new friends. do you know many people from the church? EOS 0 0 14 We worked together for almost 13 years before she retired, but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer/ work partner? I know a few of the higher ups from the area churches, and a handful of families. I know half the core staff I would be working with daily and think of them as extended family.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you just have to be patient and don' t push it too hard so that you won' t look desperate. EOS 0 0 16 The benefits are nice, also, such as staff are provided meals prepared by the banquet chef and his team when at work. And though everyone has a role, the office staff support each other well and work as a team. EOS 0 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, banquet at work. that is a wonderland stuff. EOS 0 0 18 At the risk of preaching religion, I believe God may be calling me to serve there.. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is definitely a dream job. God is everywhere. just put your trust in Him. He never sleep nor slumber.
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you feeling? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay. Thank you. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i' m okay too. EOS 0 0 4 Thats good. Do you have plans for the holidays? EOS 0 1 5 [Others] not really, i will probably just relax. what about you? EOS 0 0 6 Just hanging out at home with my husband and son. EOS 0 1 7 [Others] how' s your relationship with your family? EOS 0 0 8 It is pretty good. We all get along good. No issues. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] glad to hear so! EOS 0 0 10 How is your relationship with your family? EOS 0 1 11 [Others] it' s overly alright but i don' t really get along with my father. EOS 0 0 12 Oh i am sorry to hear that.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] don' t worry, it' s okay i am used to it.

0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic? EOS 0 0 16 so literally, I only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. I only started a new work in September, and it' s not much( about two days a week), so I can' t comment too much about that. It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps. EOS 0 0 18 so I get nervous in general when I am at work but I do my work just the same. May not be able to work as well because I have to breathe through a mask, and some other small difficulties. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is good that you can continue to do your work the same. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you for all the positive messages so far and in understanding and sympathizing with me.. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] Is there anything else I should know about how the pandemic is affecting you? EOS 0 0 22 pretty much. If anything, it' s my academic life at home that has changed not so well.. EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Are you a student? EOS 0 0 24 yes, I take online courses and I tend to procrastinate a lot more and get distracted as I find myself more and more at home. Just getting carried away and now have impending deadlines.. I can get through it but it has had a toll on my productivity.. I was just taking my sweet time with it and that wasn' t good. EOS 0 1 25 [Self-disclosure] I am also a student and am not motivated to do school work at home, so I completely understand. I am sure you are successful at school! Having a planner may keep you organized and on - task. Dedicating a certain time frame and area for school work might help, as well..
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, my name is Rose, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi Rose. I' m ok, but I get embarrassed about my curly hair. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What about your hair is embarrasing exactly? Curls seem like a lovely thing to have( mine is dead straight, lets trade lol) But no, seriously, what in particular don' t you like about it? i admire people who have natural curls.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 I' m sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What happened? EOS 4 0 3 My ex - boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Why did he break up with you? EOS 4 0 5 because I didn' t trust him and I was always jelous. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think you should try finding a psychologist to help your jealous. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I think so, because I should not feel like that, I should trust him. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Apparently psychologist is good for people who want to share feelings and emotions. EOS 4 0 9 Yes, it' s true. Thanks for the information. I' m trying not to talk to him or think about him, because I feel better. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s good for you to do that. You' ll feel better with time. EOS 4 0 11 But it' s so hard do to that. I spend a lot of time with him. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I feel the same way. When it had happened with me. However, I talked it with my friends and family and made me feel much better. EOS 4 0 13 Yes. I' ll do it. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You should spend time for yourself now. Take care of yourself.
3 1 0 [Question] Good evening! What can I help you with tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I am dealing with pandemic depression. We are completely isolated. Can' t see friends, family, hug grandkids... EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] That is extremely understandable. The pandemic is an event no one was prepared for, and it has cause unforseen upheavals.. That is a tough situation, being isolated physically from those that you love. I' m sorry you' re going through that. EOS 3 0 3 It' s been going on for months with no end in sight. EOS 3 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are you at least able to maintain contact through text and video chats?.
0 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? I am feeling rather sad. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hi there. Yes, What is making you sad? EOS 0 0 2 I feel that my friends do not like me very much any more. Apparently they have been engaging in group activities without me. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities. EOS 0 0 4 Do you think that I am over - reacting? I do not want to sound over sensitive but this has been happening for a while. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you talked with your friends on how you feel? When was the last time you all connected? EOS 0 0 6 We went out for coffee the other day and I thought about saying something cos I know they went to a club without me last weekend but I couldn' t bring myself to in the end. EOS 0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand it is tough to bring up what is bothering you, especially after getting to hang out with all your friend over coffee. I' m sure this was not intentional with not inviting you to the club. EOS 0 0 8 Sometimes in the past I have turned down invitations to go out clubbing, admittedly. Could it be that they just did not think that I wanted to go?. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] From what I have experienced personally, I am not a fan of clubs and didnt want to go with my friends. After turning them down a few times, they stopped inviting as well. I think they thought that was not my thing. EOS 0 0 10 The thing is though that this is not the only thing - they have been to rock concerts without me too. I just feel I am no longer a part of the group. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I feel how this is hurting you. The best thing would be to talk to them about feeling disinvited to group activities. Let them know you are still free and really want to spend some time together. Do you think you can open up to them on whats bothering you? EOS 0 0 12 I don' t know. I don' t want to come across as just being paranoid or whiny. Sometimes I think it would be better to just forget them and not have any friends. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like this situation is really bothering you. Its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated. The bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation. If they don' t know what is bothering you, it will be harder to mend the relationship. EOS 0 0 14 It is making me really depressed and is badly damaging my sense of self worth. I feel as though I am not worth anyone' s time. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You are worth every precious second of time and should not let this diminish your self worth. Find common ground, an activity you all enjoy and invite them to hang with you. EOS 0 0 16 Thank you that is helpful. What if I reach out and they all snub me though? EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] We all have busy hectic lives at time. True friends make time to be with one another. This world is full of beautiful people to bond with. Keeping a closed circle of friends is a blessing. EOS 0 0 18 It' s not really so much that my life is hectic. On the contrary, sometimes it feels as though it is rather empty and not having the support of friends does not help with that. Anyway I do appreciate your help - you have given me things to think about. EOS 0 1 19 [Greeting] I hear how this is making you sad not feeling supported in the way that you need to be. Know that you are worthy and will find a way to connect with them. I hope this has helped.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 The season has me down. No family around. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Are you finding time to do things you enjoy by yourself? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 3 trying to work and write but lack motivation. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are feeling some lethargy in this cold season, and feel as though you have no support from your family. EOS 0 0 5 I don' t talk to anyone. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any plans to spend Christmas with family or friends? That may help to break the cycle of feeling low? EOS 0 0 7 I live in a hotel currently. No family or friends around, especially with the virus. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What do you do for work? Are you able to get out of the hotel frequently? EOS 0 0 9 I am a writer. Witht he virus it is hard to meet anyone. i am only here until next week then I have to go to Virignia. My children r all over the country. EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I agree, it is hard to spend time with people at the moment. We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted. It would be good to have something positive to look forward to. EOS 0 0 11 I try the dating sites, but they seem to far away or impersonal. Hope things are better. Just the current season ahs me down. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I can see that. Keep in touch with your family and try to think of positive, happy times you can all have together in the future. EOS 0 0 13 No verbal communication makes it hard. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Can you call them? EOS 0 0 15 I try but the loneliness is the hard part. EOS 0 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this loneliness is really getting to you and you are struggling to see a way forwards. As you are a writer could you perhaps try to make some online friends in forums? EOS 0 0 17 It is just the lack of communication. EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear you. Perhaps you could call one of your children now? See if they' d like to catch - up? EOS 0 0 19 without any communication it makes it seem like a battle alone. My daughter is busy and 3 hours away. different time zones amke it hard. EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] Maybe schedule in a call with her for the future? I have been making time to speak with my family every Tuesday, it gives us something to look forward to each week. EOS 0 0 21 Children can only share so much. I chat with her, but the timing is off. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] What are your plans in Virginia? EOS 0 0 23 Find a place to live for awhile. I have to take care of a legal matter. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well that sounds as though it will give you something to focus on. EOS 0 0 25 I just want a person to chat with that we can share with each other. Children r ok to chat with but lack of a female to spend time with is hard. EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps once you get to Virginia you could seek out some groups or activities to find some new friends. EOS 0 0 27 Unfortunately the virus stopping people. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is very hard at the moment. But things will improve, keep communication with your family for now and when the time is right in Virginia you can start to look for new friends to spend time with in your new home.
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him.
4 1 0 [Question] how are yo. EOS 4 0 1 Good how are you. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] ok. thanks for asking. what on your mind. EOS 4 0 3 Just been having a rough time.... recently broke up with my girlfriend. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] sounds hard. are you doing anything to help. EOS 4 0 5 Trying to avoid thoughts about her, but every where on social media she is posting about her new guy. It is hard to escape the sadness. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow. in our connected world it is hard to get away. do you want to tell me how it happened. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah it is. Well we have been having trouble staying closely connected since the lockdown. We tried to make time for one another, but it has been tough. I was the one who broke things off because I know longer felt much love coming from her. I felt neglected and I thought a break up was the best solution. I did not think she would pick up a new guy two weeks later. I was not prepared to deal with this kind of pain and it hurts. EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It was wise of you to know your feeling towards the relationship and make a mature decision for the both of you. During this pandemic too. that must have been even harder.. EOS 4 0 9 Yeah it has been difficult and I know I will make it through. It is just difficult to get through break ups these days. Unless you disconnect you can' t avoid the other person. EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] that' s a good idea. Have you thought about disconnecting? EOS 4 0 11 Yeah I was thinking of maybe organizing a hunting/ fishing/ camping trip with my buddies over winter break. That could help get me out of the digital world and would help me spend quality time with my friends. EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] nothing better than the outdoors wit h some friends. Fresh air can really clear the mind. EOS 4 0 13 Yeah I think that is probably what I will end up doing. It will probably help the mental health of the entire friend group, but especially me right now. EOS 4 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] perspective is found from looking at things from a distance. you maybe to close to everything right now to see the forest from the trees. EOS 4 0 15 Thank you for the help and the advice. I think I will follow through and make the trip happen. Any tips on eventually getting back out in the dating game in these strange times? EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Again, I think you were the mature one that ended the relationship. It is hard to see her" move on", but you will do the same. covid has changed the environments to meet people though, and all I can suggest is to be patient. The world will get back to normal. and you will too.. EOS 4 0 17 Thanks I appreciate that. I can spend some time focusing on my career and relationships with friends before looking for another romantic endeavor. I appreciate your help with this situation. EOS 4 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] no problem. stay safe.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay just anxious. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that' s bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I believe i am going to fail all my finals for college. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] College finals are a stressful time for sure, I' m sure you' re doing your best to prepare. EOS 0 0 6 Yes i have been studying for hours everyday. sometimes it is hard to focus. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s best to take a short break to reset when you feel like your gears are grinding.
5 0 0 im depressed and angry. EOS 5 1 1 [Question] why would you say that? EOS 5 0 2 i really want a drink. EOS 5 1 3 [Question] is there anything I can help you with? EOS 5 0 4 i' m an alcoholic. EOS 5 1 5 [Question] do you think a drink will help you? EOS 5 0 6 Just had a stressful day. depressed because if i go get a beer i wont stop. no i guess it wouldnt. it still sucks. i want to be normal lol. i get that thought in my head and its like i become obsessed. EOS 5 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] why not try to put attention in some other things instead of a beer. EOS 5 0 8 hmmm like what? EOS 5 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] its only in your mind. EOS 5 0 10 i hate my mind. EOS 5 1 11 [Question] like working out? it will give you a lot of benefits especially with your health. you can do it!
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello there! How can I help you this afternoon?. EOS 3 0 1 I' m just feeling really down lately and would like to talk to someone who understands. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Feeling consistently sad is a tough place to be. I' m sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 3 0 3 Thank you. I think since the pandemic it' s gotten worse. It' s hard to find the" reason" to go about my day. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand that. Are you working or attending classes from home?. EOS 3 0 5 I graduated in the spring but haven' t been able to find a job because of what' s going on, so that' s been tough. My wife works from home though. What about you? EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It' s very hard to maintain a sense of consistency when we have few boundaries on our time, or a daily routine.. EOS 3 0 7 Very true! I try to keep a routine with exercise and cooking, things like that. Going outside for walks... EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I have been attending school online, and I occasionally make deliveries for my husband and I' s small business.. EOS 3 0 9 Oh that' s great! EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, a daily routine is good for normalizing change. It' s also good for structuring in time to relax and recharge, which you still need even if you aren' t currently employed. Times are still very stressful and uncertain, and that takes an emotional toll no matter who you are.. EOS 3 0 11 That' s true. Very good points. It' s hard to find a purpose right now because I' m unable to find work. When I started going to school I certainly wasn' t expecting any of this to be happening( obviously). I waited until my 30s to go to college so I feel angry that all of this is happening.. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand being angry about that. Going to school supposedly is/ was a way to take control of one' s life, it' s no longer the guarantee is once was.. I sometimes feel a similar way about my own classes. I am also in my thirties.. But I personally enjoy learning, and would always regret it if I never finished my degree. We all have our cultural norms that we conform to, whether consciously or unconsciously. Do you find yourself being stymied at the application level or the interview level when it comes to jobs?. Maybe having a professional in your career path review your resume would be helpful.
0 0 0 Hi. Hello, can you help me? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I hope so. What kind of problem are you having? EOS 0 0 2 I am really struggling with my studies at the moment, I am so anxious that I keep putting off my essays and worrying all the time. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are a student who is having trouble. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, I am a mature student and struggling with my course. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand how you feel. I was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school. It is very understandable that you are feeling stressed, especially with the pandemic and other issues happening. EOS 0 0 6 yes, the pandemic is making it worse. I am working as well so I am struggling juggling them all and running a house. I just don' t know how to get back on track with my studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about putting together a schedule to help you manage your time? EOS 0 0 8 How would I go about that? EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you go online, there are different templates for students. One would be a time management template where you fill in the blocks of different times of the day. Also, do you know any of your classmates that you could email or text for support? EOS 0 0 10 okay, I can see the sense in that. Have you used them before, if so would you recommend putting everything on there or keeping it flexible? I do have a couple that i could contact, I' ve been feeling really embarrassed to contact them, like they might think I am being silly. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] To start, fill in one week to see what all activities you have to do. Set aside specific time for doing your schoolwork. Try and stick with the schedule. EOS 0 0 12 Okay, one week doesn' t seem too scary. I could colour coordinate it, I like things in colour. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] . I would try it. EOS 0 0 14 Ok, do you think I should reach out to my classmates, will they think i' m being silly, I really don' t want to alienate them. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe there is a discussion board where you could be anonymous. Break your writing down in small chunks. Just brainstorm one day, for example. EOS 0 0 16 I don' t think so, however, I might just start with the template and see if that helps first. I like the idea of breaking things into the chunks. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try one thing at a time so you are not overwhelmed. EOS 0 0 18 Thank you, I feel a little better, maybe I just needed some control. Yes, that' s good, one thing at once. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I agree. You are not alone. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you, you have been really helpful. EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hang in there. It is great that you are in school. EOS 0 0 22 Thank you.. EOS 0 1 23 [Greeting] I enjoyed chatting with you. Take care. EOS 0 0 24 me too. Thanks. EOS 0 1 25 [Greeting] Goodbye.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hi, how are you feeling today? EOS 3 0 2 I am not feeling the best. I have been having some depression, because of not being able to see friends and family during this pandemic. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Oh, boy, do I know that feeling! How are you dealing with it?( if I may ask) EOS 3 0 4 I try to message them as much as possible and call them on the phone but it is just not the same as actually getting to give the a hug and see them in person. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] I know that. I use Zoom, just to see them... do you have a computer? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. That works for some of my family but I have family in the nursing home that does not have access to computers. I haven' t seen them in several months. It just breaks my heart. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh. I can feel it. I have someone who' s sick as well. Do you have any one friend with whom you can share your feelings, your depression. I understand you' re having issues with depression, right? It sometimes helps me to feel that we' re all in this together. And, at the other end of this, we will be able to give the biggest hugs ever!
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 im feeling pretty sad today. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 4 0 3 its about me and my friend got fight for misunderstanding. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like your feelings are hurt over a misunderstanding you had with a friend is this correct? EOS 4 0 5 yeah thats correct. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] I see i am sorry that it has you feeling down, did you try to talk with your friend to see if you could resolve your feelings? EOS 4 0 7 no he was not responding to me. he just avoiding me. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe you could send him a message on social media and let him know the argument has your feelings hurt and you would like to try to talk about it when he has time. EOS 4 0 9 thanks but he totally avoiding me he just blocked me and he ignore me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] how long have you been friends with him? EOS 4 0 11 for 5 years. but he thinks that i have affair with his girlfriend. EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] oh yea that can make things difficult, but i think if you keep reaching out you may could talk this over. Did you try to explain to him that his thoughts were not true? EOS 4 0 13 yeah but how should i start because he misjudged me and his girlfriend its a sensitive issue. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would start off by telling him that you were sorry that he had those thoughts but there is no truth to it and the fact that he does not trust you enough to know that is hurtful to you and her. If that does not work then you might need to take some time to reflect and figure out if that is a friendship worth trying to save, you may find yourself better off without a friend who shows no trust in you.
1 0 0 My friend borrowed money from me but she won' t return it now. EOS 1 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry about that. It is always hard when we trust someone and they let us down. is that waht you are feeling? Disappointment in your friend? EOS 1 0 2 Yes, i am very dissapointed because i trusted her completely. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand. I have been through a similar situation. Was it a large amount of money? EOS 1 0 4 What did you do to come out of the tricky situation? Yes, it was for me, a total of$ 10000. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, That is a very large amount of money. I can understand your being upset with them. Have you talked to them about the money and returning it? EOS 1 0 6 Yes, i am very very upset. What would you do in my position? Yes, she just sounded non - comittal, saying that she will return it when she can. EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. It is a financially difficult time for us all. I am wondering if your friend might be upset and embarrassed that they can not pay you back immediately? Have you asked her if she could even afford some sort of small payments? EOS 1 0 8 Yes, i asked her how we could restructure the payment in her favor because i understand how difficult it is for everyone right now but she did not answer. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Were you speaking on the phone or in person? Is this a financial burden for you? Would you consider this person a good friend? Would you be sad if they were not in your life anymore? EOS 1 0 10 We were speaking on phone because i wanted to set up a physical meeting where we could discuss the logistics. Yes, it is a financial burden because this is money i was saving for a venture. EOS 1 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] That is very difficult. It is hard to judge things on the phone. EOS 1 0 12 Yes, this is a really close friend from way back and i would be devastated to lose the friendship. It is difficult to judge on the phone yes, which is why i wanted a physical meeting but she snapped at me and said that she will just pay me when she can. EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I see. I am very sorry about that! it is very difficult when a friend betrays your trust like that. EOS 1 0 14 Yes, very difficult. EOS 1 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are doing what you can. It is very nice of you to have been this patient. EOS 1 0 16 How do you suggest i shoulp proceed? EOS 1 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is the friendship more important than the money? That is what it came down to for me.
3 0 0 Hi, how are you today? I feel really sad all the time. I don' t know why. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] hello. you feel sad, why? EOS 3 0 2 I' m not sure. I can' t find a reason. My health is fine. I have friends. I have a place to live. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] your health is fine and you have place to live but you are still sad. EOS 3 0 4 Yes, that' s right. I feel like my life is not going in the right direction. In fact, I' m not going anywhere. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] have you talked to anyone about it.
4 0 0 hi, how are you? My friend, My best friend, has a new friend and hardly has time for me anymore, we have been friend for over ten years. this hurts. EOS 4 1 1 [Self-disclosure] I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before. EOS 4 0 2 its so annoying and hurtful. EOS 4 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Yeah i can tell you something you might not want to hear but it ended with us ending our friendship on that level. EOS 4 0 4 i definitely do not want to end our friendship, that would be even more painful. EOS 4 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years. We still hang out but it isnt like it was before. People move on to others and it hurts. They usually are not trying to hurt us though. EOS 4 0 6 I know, but its hard when you are the one still stuck, Im not ready for change. EOS 4 1 7 [Others] Yea it was hard for me too. Thats the thing about change it just happens. I would do something focusing on yourself. Trying to make yourself feel better. EOS 4 0 8 i could try to focus on myself. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Everyone needs to and everyone forgets too heh. EOS 4 0 10 I agree, i need to focus more on myself. EOS 4 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Good, im glad you can realize that! Some people cant. EOS 4 0 12 its hard to but I know that its time to focus on me more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Great, any ideas on what you would like to focus on?

4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work. EOS 4 0 14 Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn' t even want me to help her, no she doesn' t work. EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family. EOS 4 0 16 Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] How long has it been since she moved in. EOS 4 0 18 A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you thought about a housewarming gift. EOS 4 0 20 Hmm, no I didn' t think about that, that may be a good idea. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So just a week and she is settling in. EOS 4 0 22 Yes, but the home came furnished and honestly, I didn' t think there was that much to do, but maybe I should get a gift, to break the ice. EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Friendship is important maybe she needs to hear from you. EOS 4 0 24 Yes, it is very important, I just felt if I called I would be bothering her:( EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style.
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Same old.. still trying to lose weight. Already on day 20 for fasting. did not lose a single pound. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight. What kind of methods have you been using? EOS 0 0 4 I tried keto diet for 6 months, didn' t work. So now on Fasting. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are really discouraged. EOS 0 0 6 I also go to gym 2 times a week. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow! You have been trying practically everything. You are really motivated. EOS 0 0 8 Yea, very discouraged... EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Losing weight can be difficult. I' ve struggled with that many times. Have you thought of consulting a dietician or a nutritionist to help? Maybe, they would offer some new suggestions. EOS 0 0 10 I am already lucky that I can sometime able to book swimming pool close by. I considered but they said I am not overweight. EOS 0 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like they didn' t listen to your needs. And it seems like you are doing a great job exercising at the pool and employing other methods to lose weight. What is your primary motivation behind your weight loss goal? EOS 0 0 12 The added weight is putting pressure on my hips and knees.. Causing a lot of pain as well for my lower back. EOS 0 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] That' s no good. I' ll bet that is difficult to deal with. Have you thought about teaming up with a friend and going on daily walks? EOS 0 0 14 No, I have to look after the kids.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, you could also take the kids on a walk every day. That would be a healthy activity to enjoy together, and it should help burn some of their energy too. EOS 0 0 16 I signed them up for swimming classes so they can exercise too. Thanks for your suggestion though. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s great! Now you can all go swimming together. Maybe that can be an activity that you all do together a couple times a week. EOS 0 0 18 I can' t join their classes. Yes, I am doing that.. EOS 0 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No, but I' m sure that there is a fitness club or city pool where you all can share your skills.
3 0 0 I am feeling depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about your feelings? EOS 3 0 2 I feel lost and lonely, i do not know what to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] When did these feelings come about. EOS 3 0 4 They came about when i lost my job in August of this year. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can understand where your coming from with that, especially since this pandemic occurred.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, what brings you to seek support, today? EOS 4 0 1 I am having ongoing depression. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin? EOS 4 0 3 I have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It first began a couple of weeks ago. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I am sad and anxious about the coronavirus. I miss seeing my friends and family. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you must really care about your friends and family, and this awful pandemic is prevent your from seeing them. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, definitely. I hope the pandemic will end. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all? EOS 4 0 9 I haven' t thought about dying at all. I take medication each day for my depression, but there are times when I still feel sad. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay, thanks for sharing that personal information. I only ask because thoughts of suicide are normal and anxiety and depression increase the chances of suicide. EOS 4 0 11 You' re welcome. I understand, but I am not suicidal. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] What would you like to talk about, then? We could talk about the problem more, or if you feel like it is defined, we could talk about solutions, or not talk about solutions at all. What would make you feel better? EOS 4 0 13 I would like to talk about solutions since I feel like the problem is defined. EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I know what it is like to be depressed. I also take medication for this. For solutions, studies show that working out and exercising can help depression. Have you considered this? EOS 4 0 15 Yes, I enjoy taking walks and doing a cardio workout at home. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] That' s great! What ways do you think you could communicate more with your family? EOS 4 0 17 I could communicate more with my family by calling them on the phone, texting, emailing, or talking to them on Zoom. EOS 4 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You listed a lot of good solutions such as zoom and texting. Do you think doing that would make you feel less depressed?
4 0 0 Hi. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hi. How can I help you. EOS 4 0 2 I am not happy. I lost my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, thats bad. When you lost your job? EOS 4 0 4 about 4 months ago. EOS 4 1 5 [Question] In which field you are looking for?
4 0 0 I am so embarassed and saddened. I can not believe he cheated on me. I thought we were going to work out. I was really attracted into him and I cared for him a lot. I wanted to date him longer. Thank Goodness I did not sleep with him. What a disaster. Why are men like this? Why do they break women' s hearts? I wish there were more decent men out there that did not play around. Men can be such pigs! EOS 4 1 1 [Question] what happened? EOS 4 0 2 I met a handsome intelligent man. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how are you feeling lately? EOS 4 0 4 We dated for a month. Then out of nowhere he cheated on me. I' m so sad. I am just trying to understand what I did wrong. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s okay. we should learn from things like this. EOS 4 0 6 That' s true. It' s crazy we have to experience heart ache. To learn... EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] don' t think much and keep yourself engaged in the activities you like the most. EOS 4 0 8 Hey, that is great advice! EOS 4 1 9 [Question] can you tell me how are you before this incident? EOS 4 0 10 I was happy. But when a man breaks your heart, it makes you feel very ugly. EOS 4 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] can you share me some happy memories which made you smile. EOS 4 0 12 Sure, I love going to the movies! How about you! EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] it' s okay. i can understand. yeah me too. i love movies and traveling. EOS 4 0 14 Are you American? EOS 4 1 15 [Others] I love traveling to new places. EOS 4 0 16 Yes traveling is what we are made to do as humans! EOS 4 1 17 [Others] yes, i am an american. what about you. EOS 4 0 18 Same. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] well, just think of some happy memories and try to spend time with people who value you the most. EOS 4 0 20 Yes, thank you for the great advice! Like Thanksgiving, I hope you have wonderful memories with your friends and family next week. EOS 4 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] oh, thats nice of you. thank you.
3 0 0 hi im sad. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Anything particular got you down? Hello. EOS 3 0 2 just life, bad year. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea bad year for everyone. The virus has really stopped us. Are you working or on layoff.
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing? EOS 6 0 1 I' m doing okay.. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you want to talk about? EOS 6 0 3 I' m having problems with getting up everyday and doing my daily routine. I feel bad because these are things that other people do normally. EOS 6 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah, I' ve definitely felt that way... especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day? EOS 6 0 5 Exactly. Jogging, eating breakfast, getting dressed. EOS 6 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yep, for me it' s kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just" take a break" from grinding. MTurk has kind of helped me get back in a working mindset and given me more energy... have you been doing a lot of MTurk lately? EOS 6 0 7 Yeah, 2020 has been a crazy year. I' ve been doing Mturk here and there. I plan on doing it more. It helps me stay productive. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah it helps, just forcing yourself to have goals, for sure. I' ve been determined to hit a number on MTurk and exercise every time I' m feeling tired, instead of taking a nap because my boss can' t see me, lol. I would definitely say just start setting goals and try to look forward to 2021 being better. EOS 6 0 9 Okay, I hear you. Thanks. Yeah, I guess I have to really force myself. EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Force yourself at first, then the" body in motion, stays in motion" law will take over.:) All I know, is that nothing is worse than ending a day without a sense of accomplishment and then stringing those kinds of days together. EOS 6 0 11 Okay okay. cool. That' s a helpful concept. I' m going to force myself to get up and then hopefully my body will get used to it. Yes, that' s true. I hate ending the day knowing I' ve bummed it out. EOS 6 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] One of the things I' ve noticed about 2020 and I think this contributes is that this year has taken away almost all incentives... you know before it would be like," I' m looking forward to this concert, or this movie coming out next weekend." So, when you aren' t planning things and don' t have these milestones throughout the year of events breaking up the monotony, it stinks. EOS 6 0 13 Yes, I agree. I used to go to at least one concert every year. Now that' s out of the question. It gets boring and a little depressing. Hopefully 2021 will be better. EOS 6 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m sure it will be. Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the MTurk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills. EOS 6 0 15 I will definitely. I just got to get up and get with it. I' m really in need of some exercise so I' ll do that too. I used to paint and draw but I kind of fell off and stopped doing it. I' ll get back into that too. EOS 6 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] Oh yeah, nothing is worse than losing joy in something you love doing. But, getting back in an active mindset helps. I used to love to have bonfires, it really was therapeutic for me but then I just lost the will to have them. Since I' ve been back on MTurk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks, I had one on Saturday and really enjoyed it. So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn' t because we grow out of them, it' s quite frankly because we are probably just depressed.
0 0 0 Hello. My name is Spike. What is yours? Is anyone there? I feel kind of sad and rejected that no one is answering. Is this part of the task? EOS 0 1 1 [Others] oh no i' m sorry i left you waited. please tell me your problem. EOS 0 0 2 I' m trying to make money on MTurk and starting a YouTube channel. Money is a big concern for me. EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] We are on the same boat. Do you have any other jobs? EOS 0 0 4 No. That' s my only income right now. It has led to a real crisis of self confidence to me. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you considered applying for a job or trying uber drive/ eats? EOS 0 0 6 I have. But I have health conditions that would mean Covid - 19 would be very risky for me to get. So, I' m trying to work online. I' m trying to stay encouraged. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand how you feel, it' s tough not being able to work and earn much money. However, you are doing your best right now and should feel proud of yourself. EOS 0 0 8 Thanks. I appreciate that. What do you do to stay encouraged or confident? EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I try to spend more time outdoor and keep myself busy. I like to cook since it' s very relaxing and helps keep my mind concentrated. EOS 0 0 10 cooking for me is just another chore. But getting outside might help. I live out in the country. So I have nice scenery. EOS 0 1 11 [Others] That is perfect then, the nature is very healing. You can also hang out with friends and talk to them about how you feel. EOS 0 0 12 It has been days since I even sat on the porch. And weeks since I took a walk. EOS 0 1 13 [Others] you should definitely do that. staying indoor will worsen your mentality. EOS 0 0 14 That' s a good idea. What sort of projects are you working on? Job? Hobby? EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] yeah I have a full time job and working on mturk at night. Covid has hit me financially too. EOS 0 0 16 Wow. that' s a lot. EOS 0 1 17 [Others] we all face different pressure and have to find ways around it. EOS 0 0 18 Yep. You are right. Thanks for the suggestion to get outside. I' m ging out for a walk tomorrow. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Please stay positive, go out more and exercise more frequently. EOS 0 0 20 I will. Good luck tonight. Make that money!;) EOS 0 1 21 [Greeting] you too.
4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 i feel depresed. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Why do you feel depressed? EOS 4 0 3 breakup with my partner. EOS 4 1 4 [Others] Breakups can be really tough. How long were you with your partner? EOS 4 0 5 3years of time we have been in love. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I once had a relationship end after 5 years with a partner. Staying active really helped me get over the relationship. Through that activity I actually met my new partner!
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed! EOS 7 0 7 And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that' s one method I have used.. Thank you for your trust in me.. EOS 7 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don' t overdo it.. EOS 7 0 9 I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible. true, very true.. Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen? EOS 7 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you. EOS 7 0 11 Thanks for sympathizing and understanding.. EOS 7 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation. EOS 7 0 13 ok. That' s true and I have to do more of that. Phone is also a big distraction for me. I heard that it' s best to get it out of one' s reach for best results.. Timer, great idea.. EOS 7 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I struggl ed with focus but once I put my phone away, my focus increased a lot. EOS 7 0 15 I think that' s pretty good advice. I know which room I can do this, but just away from temptation plus having an alarm from the other room to go off after an hour or so of reading. ok, I will employ these methods more.. Thank you for sharing these. EOS 7 1 16 [Question] Of course! Is anything else on your mind?
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? EOS 1 0 22 He' s a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly. EOS 1 0 24 But maybe I deserved it. EOS 1 1 25 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly. EOS 1 0 26 Yes, he did. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No you did not! Please don' t think like that. EOS 1 0 28 I' m just so angry that I could break something. And maybe I will do that! EOS 1 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this. EOS 1 0 30 But what if it doesn' t pass? And I cannot afford therapy. EOS 1 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now. There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free.

Thank you for sharing these. EOS 7 1 16 [Question] Of course! Is anything else on your mind? EOS 7 0 17 then hopefully after these two courses are done, I can have renewed faith and maturity after the new year and take new courses with better results.. not much, just academic pressure and how to deal with time management and being contentious.. EOS 7 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, that sounds like a great idea. It sounds like you' re really trying to help yourself grow. EOS 7 0 19 Yes I hope so, because when I was younger, I used to be great at not being distracted so much in my studies and just bang it out real quick and well with my books. and all this is also worsened by the pandemic, I am afraid, of just not having a renewed from the indoor isolation.. EOS 7 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, it' s true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood. I understand how you' re feeling, COVID has affected me negatively as well but I' m just trying to look at the bright side. EOS 7 0 21 yes it has on us all. I guess the other thing is that my city has been doing fine so far, but just the past two weeks or so has been more and more cases, so just getting stressed and depressed with that and prospects of a second shut down.. so yes, the second wave is here it seems( belatedly), but hopefully it doesn' t get worse, because I have seen worse in other places right now. EOS 7 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I would suggest taking up yoga or meditation to lessen the stress COVID has on your brain. EOS 7 0 23 so I suppose just trying to cope with that also because I get nervous having to go out for work or errands, and I also have to write my exam outside of my home.. ok. I could look into that. I work out in general, but have been slacking off on those ever since the pandemic started this year.. EOS 7 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I' d recommend wearing a mask whenever you go out to lessen the chance of you contracting anything. At the moment, it' s all we could do. EOS 7 0 25 yes and I have been and will continue to do that.. EOS 7 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s great! EOS 7 0 27 But aside from these stressors, I think I have a better idea now on how I should proceed, starting today. EOS 7 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s amazing, I' m glad I could help put your mind at ease. EOS 7 0 29 not that I haven' t, but just with more renewed faith and having fresh priorities in my head.. yes thank you very much for listening and understanding with my issues.. EOS 7 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] Of course, sometimes we all just need to talk to someone. EOS 7 0 31 your input has been helpful and it does help for me to kind of vent out on what has been bothering me. yes so true. Thank you for that.. EOS 7 1 32 [Others] of corurse! EOS 7 0 33 alright then. I will continue my day from here then. Thanks again, and good luck with your endeavours!. EOS 7 1 34 [Greeting] Alright, please reach out if you need to talk again! Thank you so much!
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m really stressed with school exams. and I' m struggling with anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Ah that sounds tough, why exactly are you stressed?
6 0 0 Hello, how are you?. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 6 0 2 I' m alright, honestly I' m feeling rather ashamed. The reason for that and the problem that I' m facing is that I' ve had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and I' m only 24 years old. Right now in my life I' m ready to seek help, but I' m having a lot of anxiety about it because I' m very worried about how others will judge me. I' m worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that I will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. I' m ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that I' ve made that have gotten me here and I guess my problem is that I just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that I can just finally make the step that I need so desperately and get help. EOS 6 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am in a good position to help you as I am in the same situation. Please know you are not alone. I would definitely recommend seeking help sooner rather than later! Hello? Are you wanting to talk?
5 1 0 [Question] Hi there. How are you today? EOS 5 0 1 I' m good. how r u? EOS 5 1 2 [Question] I' m doing good today. What brings you on here? EOS 5 0 3 I' m not happy with an ex friend who talks behind my back to my current friends. EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] ugh. There' s nothing worse than that. Have you confronted the ex friend? EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking. EOS 5 1 6 [Question] oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it? EOS 5 0 7 they' re still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander. EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s an option but I hope it doesn' t go that far again. Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend? EOS 5 0 9 no. i don' t want anything to do with her. if i find out my friends take her side they will be my ex friend too. EOS 5 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand that. You don' t want two people disrespecting you.. EOS 5 0 11 absolutely not. i have a strong constitution about myself and don' t allow to be disrespected by anyone. EOS 5 1 12 [Question] I hear that! What happened in court when you went? If you don' t mind me asking. EOS 5 0 13 i tried to get an order for her to stay away from me. the first judge passed it but the second judge said it wasn' t strong enough.. EOS 5 1 14 [Question] Sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can. Has she been in contact with you? EOS 5 0 15 no. she hasn' t done anything lately for me to get a court order. if she starts anything again i will get a lawyer and sue her. EOS 5 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Seems like a good idea. Steer clear of her and don' t associate with her! Sounds like you' re doing the right thing. Keep your side of the street clean. EOS 5 0 17 absolutely will avoid her. if she ever convinces my friends should i tell them i don' t want to associate with them anymore? EOS 5 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would if I were in your shoes. You don' t need two of the same person. Know what I mean? EOS 5 0 19 yeah exactly. people need to realize who' s side to stay on. EOS 5 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] LOL if only everyone had that thought process. Some people don' t get it! EOS 5 0 21 it' s easier said than done. a lot of people are afraid of being alone and will put up with garbage. EOS 5 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Definitely sounds like you have the right tools and mindset to do the right thing! I know about the alone thing especially in these times. EOS 5 0 23 yeah it sucks lol. EOS 5 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Take those tools you have, steer clear of her and do your own thing! EOS 5 0 25 i will. thank you for your advice. EOS 5 1 26 [Others] Most definitely. I wish you the best. If you every wanna chat again just stop on by!
4 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling really sad and lonely right now. My boyfriend and I broke up and it was me who wanted it but now I regret breaking up and he doesn' t want me back. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, I can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it' s too late. EOS 4 0 3 That is exactly it. I broke up with him because I liked another person but then quickly realized that I made a mistake and it' s too late. I want him back should I start calling and going to his house to beg? EOS 4 1 4 [Question] nobody knows him better than you do, right now I do not think he is in a good place either since it wasn' t his choice to end it, how do you think he would react if you started pressuring him?. EOS 4 0 5 I haven' t really thought of that yet. He has a pretty short temper actually. I know he is really mad at me so I think he might want to yell at me and get his anger out before he could start being nice to me again. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this, perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel, without pressuring him into a response. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah, that' s true. I have been secretly watching his social media and he has girls asking him out and I don' t want to let them get to him before I can get him back. I want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] you can always ask him calmly if he would like to talk, so you both have a chance to express your feelings in a safe way, with no yelling or arguing, do you think that' s something he would do? EOS 4 0 9 I can try that, I think he might be responsive at first if I dont set him off. All of his friends hate me so I have nobody on my side right now. Should I try to get his friends to like me again? Is that an way I could use to get him to want me again? EOS 4 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] nobody likes to see that one' s friend is sad because of someone else, I think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back. EOS 4 0 11 I can understand what you mean. I need to think this through. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] what made you like someone else in the first place? EOS 4 0 13 Well, we are in a small town and he was popular and the cutest guy in our town. I liked being with someone so popular. He wasn' t always nice to me and is why I wanted to be with someone else for a short time. He used to leave me at parties and go off with his friends sometimes. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] was it a common thing that he didn' t give you the attention you wanted?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there how can be of help? EOS 3 0 2 I am suffering from low mood and general depression. I don' t know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down( obviously) and there doesn' t appear to be any real reason behind it. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue? EOS 3 0 4 I felt this way for a while actually isn' t a recent change it' s been building slowly over time. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same? EOS 3 0 6 I think I know what you mean. It' s getting worse. I feel very down. EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse. EOS 3 0 8 Yeah. I worry that I' ll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. I' m really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Firstly, you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with depression and it' s good that you have reached out for help for this. EOS 3 0 10 Any suggestions on what to do about it? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many reasons people have depression. It is a recognised medical condition and the good news is that there is help out there. The first step is recognising the problem. EOS 3 0 12 Ok well there is definitely a problem. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Have you spoken to friends and family about this? do they know how much you are struggling with it at the moment?
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon.
4 1 0 [Question] Hey there, what' s going on today? EOS 4 0 1 Hello. It is a fine day, how about yourself? EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] It really is! I am just taking in the fresh air in the backyard. EOS 4 0 3 That is awesome. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Thanks! What is going on in your neck of the woods? EOS 4 0 5 Sort of stuck inside trying to make a dime but it is alright. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Yeah great minds think alike.. do you do anything else for work? EOS 4 0 7 Looking for a good job right now. I wanted to talk about a personal issue I have been having, though. EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Okay, you know I' m here for you. Talk to me, what' s happening?
3 0 0 Hi, how are you today? I feel really sad all the time. I don' t know why. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] hello. you feel sad, why?
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 Am ok but feeling sad and anxious. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that you are sad and anxious. Do you know what is causing you to feel that way?
6 0 0 hi my friend. EOS 6 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] Hello! How are you doing? EOS 6 0 2 feeling very shame. EOS 6 1 3 [Question] Oh my god! What happened? EOS 6 0 4 i have cheated on my girlfriend. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel sorry for you.. What was the reason behind that? I understand how you are feeling right now.
4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out. EOS 4 0 6 I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night? EOS 4 0 8 I can' t sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it' s typically late afternoon. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds like you are doing the very best you can under difficult circumstances. you should feel very proud about that. EOS 4 0 10 thank you. i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] it sounds to me that your sleep issue is really weighing on your mind. you may be setting yourself up for sleep issues by thinking about this so much. is that possible? EOS 4 0 12 yes it may be. i' m not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you' re under a lot of pressure. it' s only natural that you would feel overwhelmed. dont be hard on yourself. you' re doing the best you can. EOS 4 0 14 thank you. that is very supportive. i just dont know how to make the next ten days go by faster. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] perhaps you can spend some time doing pleasant things. it is true that time seems to go fast when we' re having fun. EOS 4 0 16 that' s true. i thought about maybe playing video games. EOS 4 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] fantastic! that' s a great way to spend your time.
3 0 0 I' m so depressed, I just got layed off. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I am sorry to hear that, did you apply for unemployment benefit? That at least can help you financially until you get a new job. EOS 3 0 2 Yes, it will take weeks and the holidays are just around the corner. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sucks it happens so close to the holidays. I understand it' s hard to accept but I' d recommend talking with someone close to you like a friend and family member. EOS 3 0 4 I know, with all the other crap going on now everyone else has their own problems they don' t want to hear mine. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure someone will be there for you, they know you need them the most right now. If you don' t feel comfortable talking to them, you can seek online therapist. There are a lot of free service for mental car. EOS 3 0 6 They' re busy with other people' s problems. I' ll deal with it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It' s not gonna be easy, but at the same time not impossible. Try looking at it a different way. You can use this time to train your skills or do things that you' ve wanted to but didn' t have the time. EOS 3 0 8 I wanted to travel but that' s not a good idea right now. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] You can still travel domestically or just around your city. I like taking a walk in the park or wandering downtown to clear my mind. EOS 3 0 10 I live in a small town and were are suppose to self quarantine unless we have to leave the house for work or go to the store. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] that really sucks. Do you have a garden at home? In the mean time, try following youtube or other channels to work out, it helps you distract from current issue and also makes you healthier. A healthy body is needed for a healthy mind. EOS 3 0 12 I did, everything is gone now.. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] what have you been doing lately? EOS 3 0 14 I do like to cook. I' ll probable do more of that now. EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s a great idea, cooking and doing crafts can be helpful for you. Instead of complaining with others, you can just invite them to join cooking with you, that way you can have companion.
1 0 0 I' m qualified for a promotion but my boss is refusing to promote me based on biased feedback he has received from someone else. EOS 1 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn' t willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right? EOS 1 0 2 Yes that' s right. It' s frustratgn.* frustrating. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co - worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective. EOS 1 0 4 Unfortunately I can' t really talk to anyone at work because there is no one I trust to this extent. Promotions are a bit of a sensitive issue. EOS 1 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you reported to your HR department the issue around biased feedback being used as a determining factor in not being considered? EOS 1 0 6 The HR department favours managers so I am worried that will damage my chances of promotion further. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry you have to deal with this at work. I think you deserve the promotion because you are very dedicated. EOS 1 0 8 Thanks, that' s good to hear. EOS 1 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think if you continue to advocate for yourself in a positive manner you could possibly increase the chances of being considered for the promotion. EOS 1 0 10 It' s hard to be positive when I feel like my manager is not receptive to my opinions and just trusts the feedback given by this one other person. EOS 1 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' ve worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment. My co - workers were not supportive and I was always overlooked. Eventually, I realized that the environment was toxic and chose to start applying for different jobs. I felt like if my potential couldn' t be appreciated then I should go somewhere with opportunities for growth. EOS 1 0 12 Maybe it is time for me to start looking elsewhere for better opportunities. I' ve worked at this place so long that I have become comfortable here and the thought of searching for a new job is intimidating. EOS 1 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You' ve got this! It' s easy to become comfortable in what we know but, change causes us to grow.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay just anxious. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that' s bothering you?
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. EOS 3 0 16 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. EOS 3 0 18 That is a good point.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. EOS 3 0 20 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand. EOS 3 0 22 I should trust my partner more than any random person. EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters. EOS 3 0 24 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? EOS 3 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you.... even after work. EOS 3 0 26 okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. EOS 3 0 28 That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you? EOS 3 0 30 Okay. I will keep that in mind. We are 22. EOS 3 1 31 [Question] Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis?
2 1 0 [Question] hi! how are you doing today> EOS 2 0 1 Hello, I' m doing okay, wbu? EOS 2 1 2 [Others] ok it' s been a stressful time for most of us but we are all doing the best we can. EOS 2 0 3 Yeah that' s true. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] whats been the weirdest part of the pandemic for you? EOS 2 0 5 So I live with my boyfriend and my bestfriend. And I am afraid they are doing skethy stuff behind my back. It sounds crazy, and I don' t have any proof but I have this feeling. The way they talk around each other makes me nervous. EOS 2 1 6 [Question] hmm, tell me more. what do you think is going on? EOS 2 0 7 I' m scared when it is just the two of them here at home. And they are jsut so much more friendly together than before we moved in. EOS 2 1 8 [Question] living together can make people more comfortable with each other. has there been something specific that has caused you to wonder about them> EOS 2 0 9 Not really specifics. It' s more of a just in general sort of thing. I know them both really really well, so I am just picking up on tiny little details. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] i hear you. have you said anything to either one of them? EOS 2 0 11 I have talked to my boyfriend, but he just tells me that it' s crazy I would think something like that. Idk... I don' t want to sound crazy and blow it out of proportion if it' s really nothing. I don' t know if there is actually something I should be worried about, or if I am thinking these crazy thoughts for other reasons. EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] having doubts about relationships is rough. do you know brene brown? EOS 2 0 13 I don' t know who that is. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she researches shame and vunerability. EOS 2 0 15 Does she do live talks or videos? Or is she more in online writing. EOS 2 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she has a great TED talk!
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am very sorry to hear that. What are you sad about? EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently? EOS 4 0 5 It is over permanently... EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah I guess, the relationship was a little toxic and she sometimes only used me for money. Maybe is it for the best now that I think about it. EOS 4 1 8 [Others] Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!! EOS 4 0 9 Yeah I just miss having someone there for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] All you need now is to give yourself some TLC.. treat yourself to something nice and go easy on yourself. EOS 4 0 11 What is TLC. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] There will be someone else. I never thought I' d find anyone else but I did and we' ve been together ten years ago now! Tender Loving Care:) Means be good to yourself. EOS 4 0 13 Ok yeah your story is very inspirational to me. Maybe this was needed in order to find the right person. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anything you can do to distract yourself right now? Plan a holiday or take a night class or something? EOS 4 0 15 I am now doing mturk to get my mind off of it to make some extra money. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Save up what you make and buy yourself something nice? EOS 4 0 17 yeah the only problem is I am barely getting any money from this. Do you have any tips onto how I can make more money/ EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There is some very lucrative stuff out there:). Take what we are doing right now for instance. EOS 4 0 19 I mean 15 minutes for 2$ doesn' t seem very lucrative. but I guess it ads up. EOS 4 1 20 [Question] beats flipping burgers;). So, what are you going to do to get yourself back onto the dating market? EOS 4 0 21 I am going to wait for this whole covid thing to end and then get a real job and once I fix my financial situation I will start dating again. EOS 4 1 22 [Others] Ah yes, the world feels like it' s on hold at the moment doesn' t it? Probably not a good time to start sharing germs with new people: D. EOS 4 0 23 Yeah exactly and I have more pressing matters at hand than a girlfriend because like I said, I am in need of money right now since. EOS 4 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' ll be around for ages if you want to talk some more on here! EOS 4 0 25 I think talking to you has benefited me a lot so thank you for that. I am feeling happy right now. EOS 4 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You' re welcome:) I have a solution for every problem you know;)
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello there! How can I help you this afternoon?. EOS 3 0 1 I' m just feeling really down lately and would like to talk to someone who understands. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Feeling consistently sad is a tough place to be. I' m sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 3 0 3 Thank you. I think since the pandemic it' s gotten worse. It' s hard to find the" reason" to go about my day. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand that. Are you working or attending classes from home?. EOS 3 0 5 I graduated in the spring but haven' t been able to find a job because of what' s going on, so that' s been tough. My wife works from home though. What about you? EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It' s very hard to maintain a sense of consistency when we have few boundaries on our time, or a daily routine.. EOS 3 0 7 Very true! I try to keep a routine with exercise and cooking, things like that. Going outside for walks... EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I have been attending school online, and I occasionally make deliveries for my husband and I' s small business..

2 0 0 hi. EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hey! How are you? EOS 2 0 2 trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once:( EOS 2 1 3 [Question] What are these thoughts?:) EOS 2 0 4 Its so stupid. I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts just come so fast. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while. EOS 2 0 6 tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes I cant controll the thoughts or like I dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing. EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] A chemical thing, so maybe you need a counsellor, and then he can assess your problem, and everything will be alright:) EOS 2 0 8 I have one and it helps sometimes. I try to meditate. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. Does it help you? If it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently. EOS 2 0 10 i pretty much have to do it constantly. EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Not constantly. because then you won' t have anytime to do anything else, but if negative thoughts always come into your head, maybe try doing something you enjoy doing. EOS 2 0 12 yeah maybe its as simple as that. I know Im the problem cause its very obvious that im the on ein control of the thoughts for the most part. EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, maybe. But always look at the bright side of stuff and maybe the negative thoughts can stop. EOS 2 0 14 right. I will try and start that more today and commit to it. EOS 2 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes that' s the spirit! And with that mind set good things will always come to you! EOS 2 0 16 yes i agree. when i consistently use meditation and positive attitude, any bad things are defintely minimized. EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, as long as you keep focused and not divert into any other thoughts:) EOS 2 0 18 yes. do you meditate?' EOS 2 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I do it once a week and it really helps. I used to do it more often when I felt I couldn' t do anything right, so always do it according to the situation.

EOS 4 0 4 Good to hear. Been feeling lonely due to this pandemic. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I totally understand it. I felt lonely too by staying home all the time. But I found we can borrow books online. A good book can really help. EOS 4 0 6 Do you mean physical or ebooks? EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Both will help. But ebooks are easier to get and you don' t need to contact anyone and anything outside your home. EOS 4 0 8 Any genres you would suggest? EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I like biographies. Stories of real people are inspiring. EOS 4 0 10 Oh ok. I was thinking about getting a dog, is that a good idea? EOS 4 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a great idea! Dog is human' s best friend. I would love to have a dog myself. EOS 4 0 12 Do you have any dogs?

There is a lock down from where I live, how about you? EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] We are in similar situation. These days I only go out for grocery shopping. EOS 4 0 16 Same situation. I fear for the worse. Economy seems to be on a downturn. EOS 4 1 17 [Others] Yeah, economy cannot do well if this situation drags on. Hope the vaccine will soon be approved and life can be back to normal. EOS 4 0 18 When do you think things will go back to normal? EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Based on the news and information I read, I think things should get better by the next spring.

What' s going on at work that' s making you upset? EOS 1 0 3 i think boss hate me. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That can be very uncomfortable. Are there reason you feel that way? EOS 1 0 5 nothing i do pleases the man. all he does is complain. EOS 1 1 6 [Question] Ugh - is he like this with everyone else, too - or do you think it' s just directed at you? EOS 1 0 7 i think its directed to me. EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Can you give an example and then maybe we can replay it a different way? EOS 1 0 9 if am asked to complete a task, i do complete them and make sure no mistake was made, if he will evaluate the task he always sees fault in what i do. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hmm= that is frustrating. Can you sit with him and go over each section that he finds fault with and ask how he would have done it? EOS 1 0 11 he never give time to listen. i think i' ll quit the job. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe talk to his secretary and make an appointment with him. don' t quit the job unless you have another one lined up.. EOS 1 0 13 i never tried talking to his secretary. i think that' s a good idea. EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she' s your first line to getting alone time with him! she' ll get you an appointment for sure!
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi like I said a bit down. EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I did not see that, I am sorry. Do you want to talk about it? It might help. EOS 4 0 3 Ohh thank you for the offer. Proscanation is my thing i guess, and this days I am paying for it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Is it affecting your work or your home life? EOS 4 0 5 Yes it affects everything. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Can you give me an example of something that has been affected recently? For instance, I had been putting off cleaning my house and then some friends dropped by without warning and I was mortified. EOS 4 0 7 I didn' t meet deadline a year back, and lost my job. Now I couldn' t even pay rents. Living with a sibling. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That sounds bad. Have you considered you might be suffering from depression? EOS 4 0 9 Probably. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You sound quite lethargic. I think you should see a GP? EOS 4 0 11 Thank you. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you feel as though life is hopeless and there is no way forward? EOS 4 0 13 No no no... me the super optimist. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] Well that is something:) What are you looking forward to? EOS 4 0 15 Will achieve my goals with proscanation or not. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] What sort of goals have you set for yourself?
6 0 0 Hi. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. how are you? how may i help you today?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 3 0 1 Hello. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, i feel like i am in depsression. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed?? EOS 3 0 5 My partner broke up with me impromptu. EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now. EOS 3 0 7 Exactly, that is my current situation. I feel like my entire life has been rearranged. How did you deal with them and specifically what was your coping mechanism? EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days. I slowly realised that i had put myself in slow motion and then slowly started to do things i used to do to maybe come out of it. EOS 3 0 9 True, what ways would you suggest i use to approach my situation and get out of this state? It is very pathetic really when you think of it, halting all your life activities and plans just because a relationship ended. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well i had a close friend that i was able to vent to and help me see what was important. Do you have anyone close in your life you could talk to for guidance? EOS 3 0 11 Close friends can really be helpful in such situations. Yes, i do have a close friend even though i am very poor when it comes to opening up. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see what you mean about pathetic lol. But rather than see yourself as pathetic in a negative, use that defiance to push yourself back out into the world. Start slowly with opening up, maybe even tell your friend you intent and ask them to be patient as you learn to better express your inner feelings. EOS 3 0 13 Yes, i should do that because at the end of it all i still have myself to take care of. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think youre already on the right track. I just know you can get back to you! EOS 3 0 15 Opening up is a skill that i could do better at because i have never been the open type. But with a little practice i could get better at it. I have to get better no matter what. Are there other tactics you can share with me with regards to my current situation? EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are resources online that perhaps you could look into to help with expressing yourself. EOS 3 0 17 Is there any particular resource you can refer me to? EOS 3 1 18 [Others] Yes just a moment. EOS 3 0 19 Waiting, thank you. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I was going to send you a few links but it wont let me.
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you doing? EOS 6 0 1 I' m doing okay.. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you want to talk about? EOS 6 0 3 I' m having problems with getting up everyday and doing my daily routine. I feel bad because these are things that other people do normally. EOS 6 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah, I' ve definitely felt that way... especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day? EOS 6 0 5 Exactly. Jogging, eating breakfast, getting dressed. EOS 6 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yep, for me it' s kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just" take a break" from grinding. MTurk has kind of helped me get back in a working mindset and given me more energy... have you been doing a lot of MTurk lately? EOS 6 0 7 Yeah, 2020 has been a crazy year. I' ve been doing Mturk here and there. I plan on doing it more. It helps me stay productive. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah it helps, just forcing yourself to have goals, for sure. I' ve been determined to hit a number on MTurk and exercise every time I' m feeling tired, instead of taking a nap because my boss can' t see me, lol. I would definitely say just start setting goals and try to look forward to 2021 being better. EOS 6 0 9 Okay, I hear you. Thanks. Yeah, I guess I have to really force myself. EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Force yourself at first, then the" body in motion, stays in motion" law will take over.:) All I know, is that nothing is worse than ending a day without a sense of accomplishment and then stringing those kinds of days together.
2 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you feeling today? EOS 2 0 1 Hi. I' m feeling okayish. EOS 2 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest. EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely. I recently broke up with my girlfriend. We had been together for more than 3 years. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] What happened that made you guys break up? EOS 2 0 5 She said that she simply wasn' t in love anymore, and that she didn' t have the same feelings she did at the beginning. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have also had this situation happen to me. Maybe it just wasn' t the right timing or she had other interests. EOS 2 0 7 She was so important for me. I feel so empty.... I Feel like I' m never finding anyone like her ever again, EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I' ve had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life. EOS 2 0 9 It' s easier said than done. At times I would rather maybe just dissapear. I have never had anyone else show romantic interest in me before. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] What is your age? EOS 2 0 11 I am 25 at the moment. EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] You still have your whole life ahead of you. Some people don' t find a partner until their 40' s or even 50' s. When I left my ex I found this guy that I truly fell in love with. He is still sulking in his living room. I told him that if he didn' t move one that he wouldnt get anywhere in life. I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what I would want him to do and I think thats what your girl would want you to do as well. EOS 2 0 13 I disagree with you regarding that maybe that is what she wants me to do. I don' t think she cares about me at the slightest anymore. I was a burden for her and will probably keep being it for any woman I meet. EOS 2 1 14 [Question] Did she give you any reasons to why she wasn' t in love anymore?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 hello. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 0 0 3 I need ways alleviate stress while studying. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there.
3 0 0 hi im sad. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Anything particular got you down? Hello. EOS 3 0 2 just life, bad year. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea bad year for everyone. The virus has really stopped us. Are you working or on layoff. EOS 3 0 4 yes it has, the political turmoil in the United States is very scary as well. I am self employed. but not working alot. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is an understatement with the politics. What do you do. EOS 3 0 6 I am a writer. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I Freelance my self. Do you work for anyone or just in general. EOS 3 0 8 mostly sights that talk about movies. there are a few i submit to. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Good. I write on a forum called Medium. I write and can get paid also. EOS 3 0 10 oh yes i know that one. EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There are various topics you can write about. Just write and post. Are you a copywriter. EOS 3 0 12 that is cool. a good way to discover other writers as well. I wish, that would be good money. i' m horrible at doing things for others, I need people to pay me to do my thing.. EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I read different postings and have over 30 followers. EOS 3 0 14 awesome, good for you. EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But if you write on Medium you can earn money. EOS 3 0 16 oh i didnt know that. thats cools. i should check it out. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] I ask that about copywriting because I am on LinkedIn. EOS 3 0 18 oh, i dont use it much. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There is also proofreading that can help establish yourself.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there how can be of help?
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic? EOS 0 0 16 so literally, I only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. I only started a new work in September, and it' s not much( about two days a week), so I can' t comment too much about that. It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps. EOS 0 0 18 so I get nervous in general when I am at work but I do my work just the same. May not be able to work as well because I have to breathe through a mask, and some other small difficulties. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is good that you can continue to do your work the same. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you for all the positive messages so far and in understanding and sympathizing with me.. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] Is there anything else I should know about how the pandemic is affecting you? EOS 0 0 22 pretty much. If anything, it' s my academic life at home that has changed not so well.. EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Are you a student? EOS 0 0 24 yes, I take online courses and I tend to procrastinate a lot more and get distracted as I find myself more and more at home. Just getting carried away and now have impending deadlines.. I can get through it but it has had a toll on my productivity.. I was just taking my sweet time with it and that wasn' t good. EOS 0 1 25 [Self-disclosure] I am also a student and am not motivated to do school work at home, so I completely understand. I am sure you are successful at school! Having a planner may keep you organized and on - task. Dedicating a certain time frame and area for school work might help, as well.. EOS 0 0 26 Because prior to the pandemic, I was pretty regimented with set schedules and can clear my mind with work - outs and going to the gym and movies, but now it' s not that simple.. EOS 0 1 27 [Question] Is there anything else I can help you with? EOS 0 0 28 Thank you and I hope your schooling goes well also.. EOS 0 1 29 [Greeting] Thank you, you too! EOS 0 0 30 yeah I like your idea of dedicating the time. I find that I am slacking off and being disorganized in areas like time management. So yes I have to improve on that.. I suppose you have been doing your schooling relatively better in your situation?. I hope you do anyhow. EOS 0 1 31 [Question] Great ideas! Is there anything else I can help you with? EOS 0 0 32 would you have any other advice on how to overcome things like time management with academics? like how to avoid procrastination? Because this was so much better in the past that I just had set schedules and can clear my mind by going out, etc.. and feeling refreshed and feeling the urgency to study again.. But that' s gone for me now.. EOS 0 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would reccomend setting deadlines in your planner of when tasks need to be completed and also setting timers for 20 minutes at a time where you have to focus for that long before you can do any other task. EOS 0 0 34 Great, I think that' s a good area for me to go into.. Timers and set agendas. EOS 0 1 35 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes! EOS 0 0 36 like a timetable when they used to hand out when I used to be in high school, let' s say. and this hour I do this, etc.. and as you say, yoga or work out in between. all great ideas I think. EOS 0 1 37 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, excellent! EOS 0 0 38 thank you for that.. ok then. I think I am set now to get back to my studies then with a refreshed mind.. EOS 0 1 39 [Greeting] You are so welcome. Have a great day!

3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, I' m pretty much down. trying to keep my head afloat. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] im sorry to hear that. Would you care to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 3 0 3 I lost my job some months back and it hasn' t really been easy for me. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, loss of income can be very stressful. Have you been looking for work since then? EOS 3 0 5 Sometimes when I enter a place where my friends are, they tend to go silent when I enter the room. Yes. Its been months now and nothing yet. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Why do you think it is that they go silent? EOS 3 0 7 I' m pretty sure they were talking about me. 2 of myy friends have been helping me with rent money. and I' m pretty sure they must be fed up. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried picking up odd jobs maybe cleaning for someone or helping them move or organize there things? EOS 3 0 9 Yes I have. That' s what helps with feeding and getting some little things at home. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Have you asked them if this is causing problems? EOS 3 0 11 and sometimes I pay back little of what they loan me since I know I cant pay all of it. EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could offer to do some things for them in return for the money so its not like they are just giving it to you. EOS 3 0 13 I' ve playfully asked why did they all go silent when I walked in, but they try changing the topic to something else. I babysit sometimes. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would let them know that i notice it happening and it is starting to concern you and if it is the problem you would gladly do some things for them to earn it rather them just giving it to you to help out. EOS 3 0 15 It' s not as easy as you say it. I feel I' m no longer needed. like an outcast. EOS 3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure if it was a major problem when you brought it up one of them would have spoke up, I would try not to worry to much over that and focus more on finding a job. EOS 3 0 17 Okay. Thanks. EOS 3 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes when i have to much free time on my hands i start to feel the same but when i find away to fill the time i no longer feel useless. No problem, I hope you feel better soon! EOS 3 0 19 I hope so too. Cause at this point, I think I' m going to lose it. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe they are talking about ways they could help you out but do not want to speak about it in front of you as to not make you feel like a charity case or worse about your situation.
0 0 0 Hello, I' m having a terrible day. My name is Sean and I work for a large distribution company. EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] hi! i' m sorry to hear that. how is your work going so far. EOS 0 0 2 The problem with a job like Amazon or Kehe distribution is the quotas. The pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID? EOS 0 0 4 no COVID 19 has nothing to do with any of this work. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how anxious you are right now. Can you give me some more info on your job. EOS 0 0 6 well when there are 50 million americans out of work right it' s a bit scary. i' m a forklift operator..... I move pallets from one area of the warehouse to another but i. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i totally understand how nerve wrecking this is, but trust me you guys being front - line workers are our real heros. EOS 0 0 8 am based on a quota. I am suppose to be able to move 10 pallets per hour. that' s almost impossible as it is a 1 million square foot warehouse. If i get a pallet on the west side and have to move it to the east side that takes 7 - 10 minutes even if your going dangerously fast. doesn' t feel like it to me. EOS 0 1 9 [Question] did you try discussing your concerns with your Team Lead/ Warehouse Supervisor of your group.
3 0 0 Hi, How are you doing? I am in bad mood.. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] What' s wrong? EOS 3 0 2 This work from home tension and cant go out with my family and parties. It makes me depressed and cant bear this pathedic situation. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. I, too, am struggling with COVID - 19. It' s going to be difficult not to see family during the holidays. We' ll get through this, though, don' t you think. Have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone? Maybe there is a way to find ways to have fun online with your friends and family. We actually played games together recently. Is that something you could do to reconnect?
0 1 0 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today? EOS 0 0 1 I am so stressed out because my business has suffered this year. I am very worried I may have to close and I won' t be able to pay my bills. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is really tough. a lot of people are going through that, you are not alone. what kind of business do you have? EOS 0 0 3 I sell cosmetics. I think a lot of people don' t have money to buy non essential items right now. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] christmas is right around the corner though, and it is almost the 15th. military get paid the 1st and 15th so there is still hope for a christmas rush! tax season is right around the corner too... there is defineately still reason to keep hope. EOS 0 0 5 That might be true. I just don' t know that business will ever recover. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you online or in store? EOS 0 0 7 Mostly online. EOS 0 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] thats great then, online businesses are less likely to fail. you know, i am in construction and there are soo many zoom meetings. honestly, i was in an office with 4 people and hardly wore make up. now with all these meetings i amd doing meetings constantly and i have had to start wearing more make up to look more profesional. i know it can be scry, but you ust have to keep a positive attitude. EOS 0 0 9 Yeah we don' t have to shut down. But with so many people struggling to make ends meet, there just doesn' t seem to be enough left over to buy extra things. and that' s true. There are people on zooms that want to wear makeup. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] also, i think it depends on where you are in the world. covid hit my area really hard around april/ may, but things are completely back to normal now. people hardly wear masks, stores are open, it just takes time.
4 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hai. EOS 4 0 1 Hai. My name is Tom and i really need your help. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok tell me. EOS 4 0 3 I am really sad and stressed up knowing that I am soon losing my job due to the effects of corona virus. For sure if I lose my job now I might go to depression because I have a family to take care of. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, don' t worry friend,
5 1 0 [Question] Hi there. How are you today? EOS 5 0 1 I' m good. how r u? EOS 5 1 2 [Question] I' m doing good today. What brings you on here? EOS 5 0 3 I' m not happy with an ex friend who talks behind my back to my current friends. EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] ugh. There' s nothing worse than that. Have you confronted the ex friend? EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking. EOS 5 1 6 [Question] oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it? EOS 5 0 7 they' re still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander. EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s an option but I hope it doesn' t go that far again. Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend? EOS 5 0 9 no. i don' t want anything to do with her. if i find out my friends take her side they will be my ex friend too. EOS 5 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand that. You don' t want two people disrespecting you.. EOS 5 0 11 absolutely not. i have a strong constitution about myself and don' t allow to be disrespected by anyone. EOS 5 1 12 [Question] I hear that! What happened in court when you went? If you don' t mind me asking. EOS 5 0 13 i tried to get an order for her to stay away from me. the first judge passed it but the second judge said it wasn' t strong enough.. EOS 5 1 14 [Question] Sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can. Has she been in contact with you? EOS 5 0 15 no. she hasn' t done anything lately for me to get a court order. if she starts anything again i will get a lawyer and sue her. EOS 5 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Seems like a good idea. Steer clear of her and don' t associate with her! Sounds like you' re doing the right thing. Keep your side of the street clean. EOS 5 0 17 absolutely will avoid her. if she ever convinces my friends should i tell them i don' t want to associate with them anymore? EOS 5 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would if I were in your shoes. You don' t need two of the same person. Know what I mean? EOS 5 0 19 yeah exactly. people need to realize who' s side to stay on. EOS 5 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] LOL if only everyone had that thought process. Some people don' t get it!
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you? EOS 1 0 2 Not so good. How are you doing? EOS 1 1 3 [Question] I am doing okay thank you for asking! would you like to talk about whats wrong? EOS 1 0 4 Yes. Well today I had a delivery order. So I went to McDonald' s and pick up the order and took it to the right address and after a few hours I notice that the client did not confirm the order. EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am not knowledgeable in this service industry. Let me understand. You delivered the order, but the customer did not confirm they wanted it.. EOS 1 0 6 Five minutes later my supervisor called me saying that the client call and reported that he did not received his order. And that' s not true at all, I gave him the food. So now i don' t know if they going to fired me or let me keep the job. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation? EOS 1 0 8 Of course I did. He told me he going to give me the benefit of the doubt but that is not enough. Im an honest person and this kind of accusation makes me feel very bad. EOS 1 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I understand, but do not feel bad about yourself. You did your work honestly and delivered the food to your customer. Can I suggest something moving forward?. EOS 1 0 10 Yes. But stuff like that makes me look bad and makes people dont trust me. Sure. That can help. I would appreciate it. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe every time you make a delivery, you can take a picture of it for proof. or maybe you can have a copy of the receipt and have the customer sign it as well. EOS 1 0 12 Well. I normally take pictures of every delivery I make but I let this pass and look what happened. EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] it' s okay, it happens to everyone. we are human and we tend to make the smallest mistakes. The important thing is to learn from them.. Is there anything else bothering you at work? EOS 1 0 14 Yes. It won' t happen again for sure. This makes me dont trust people again. Well. This is the first time I ever faced this kind of problem at work. EOS 1 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] as long as you believe in yourself to be honest, don' t worry about what other people think. Your boss will come to understand you are a honest worker. It is also amazing that you have come such a long way without having other problems. that is great!. EOS 1 0 16 I know but sometimes one small thing can hurt you and ruined the reputation that you had build for a long time. EOS 1 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, i understand what you are saying. It' s really hard to move on from bad experiences, staying positive is important in these situations. EOS 1 0 18 Yes. I guess so. You are right. I just going to move on and do my things. Thank you very much for taking your time and encouraging me with your words. EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There' s no need to thank me! i hope I could make you feel better.
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work. EOS 4 0 14 Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn' t even want me to help her, no she doesn' t work. EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family. EOS 4 0 16 Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] How long has it been since she moved in. EOS 4 0 18 A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you thought about a housewarming gift.
3 0 0 hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hey. How are you? EOS 3 0 2 i am not feeling too great. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why not? EOS 3 0 4 i am not able to find a job for over 5 years. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] How have you been able to get by? EOS 3 0 6 i am on social assiatnce but its not enough and i feel so worthless. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If you keep trying things will work out in the end. EOS 3 0 8 but i have been tryin for so long, i dont know what ti do. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Perhaps you havent searched well enough, have you gone to many interviews? EOS 3 0 10 yes I did do a lot of interveiws but no one hired me. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps on the interviews you are doing something wrong, because it have been a while. EOS 3 0 12 i feel that i am not worthy and that no one thinks i am capable. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Dont think that. You are worthy, you just need to apply yourself in the right direction:) EOS 3 0 14 how can i do this. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps look for any job for now, even if they wage isn' t good, because you have to start with something. You need some work experience.
0 0 0 Hello, I' m having a terrible day. My name is Sean and I work for a large distribution company. EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] hi! i' m sorry to hear that. how is your work going so far.

EOS 0 1 9 [Question] did you try discussing your concerns with your Team Lead/ Warehouse Supervisor of your group. EOS 0 0 10 I feel like a replaceable cog in a giant machine that doesn' t give two shits whether I show up for work or not despite having over five years experience with over 12 forklifts..... Yes and they always say the same thing. You need to get your numbers up but it' s a catch 22 you can' t possibly safely get your numbers up and accomplish your quotas. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are doing your best and are working really hard. EOS 0 0 12 so. EOS 0 1 13 [Question] just a thought - did you try changing roles within the warehouse to a different position? or try checking with the manager regarding this. you have 5 years exp, i' m sure you deserve a better role and pay. EOS 0 0 14 I am a felon and I have a bachelores degree in business management. I am desperately trying to get out of the quota based work areas. EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] i understand, but when i had a slight trouble with my job, talking to my manager helped me a lot. also, your manager is your best point of contact for a great reference. EOS 0 0 16 Do you know how incredibly hard it is to serve your time in jail for 3 years and get out and can' t find a job except scrubbing floors or cleaning shit or servinge tables. my manager doesn' t give a shit. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] thats hard,.. but you can do it. EOS 0 0 18 do what. work at burger king for$ 7. 25 an hour. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] do your best in your job! hard work ultimately pays off! EOS 0 0 20 I' m not so sure if that' s true anymore. It' s not what you know.... it' s who you know. and with my felony my reputation is nothing but shit. my real worry is that this is one of the highest paying jobs in my area.$ 16 an hour plus almost unlimiteed overtime. for a felon even with a degree that' s phenominal in florida. EOS 0 1 21 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you feel you are not heard and thats why you are pushing yourself hard do you feel that way. EOS 0 0 22 America is just not fair. EOS 0 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Its great that you are working hard despite whatever you faced and I assure that this will help you build a great future in this country.
3 1 0 [Greeting] hello!! EOS 3 0 1 I am very depressed. I found out that my girlfriend is cheating on me with my friend! EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] that' s really bad. even I was also in the same situation. EOS 3 0 3 I have been with her for close to 2 years and now she has been cheating me right under my nose for the past few months! how foolish of me to blindly trust her... How did you deal with it? EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] To be honest i was not completely came out it since it was 3 years but now i somehow getting better i tried to divert myself from the thoughts engage myself with other friends spend more time with my family like that. try to divert yourself, keep yourself busy, spend more time with family, try to minimize the usage of mobile. EOS 3 0 5 But my family is away from me in another country. I can' t even go back due to this stupid covid! I feel betrayed and like dying. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] yeah I could understand your feelings right now. EOS 3 0 7 I actually broke my phone in anger and damaged her credit card. I feel like slapping both of them so hard that they forget where they came from! but I can' t do anything. I am helpless. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah its really hard to handle this state of mind but we need to.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:) EOS 2 0 7 It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am in the UK. It' s sort of a grey area... police won' t really do anything but you can' t buy it over the counter.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Nice to meet you Jim, I am doing well. Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 3 I really appreciate your time Yes. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What is on your mind? EOS 0 0 5 I have been retired for over 2 years and would like to return to the workforce, part - ti me. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are thinking of going back to work? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, It would help us greatly. EOS 0 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have the right idea already. EOS 0 0 9 There are plenty of jobs and not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will find something suitable if you keep trying. EOS 0 0 11 Thanks What do you mean? Yeah, I know this but I don' t feel it.. EOS 0 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] You may feel a little apprehensive to get started. EOS 0 0 13 Yeah, I am. I know I can do it. Not sure where to start. EOS 0 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I have been in the same position before and came out successful in the end. EOS 0 0 15 Wow, That' s great. How did you start?. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I just decided. EOS 0 0 17 What gave you the strength to go forward? I have this nervousness about getting rejected.. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Doing little things every day. EOS 0 0 19 So, keep myself busy and try to ignore my nervousness? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Really adds up and helps to get the big picture moving. EOS 0 0 21 OK, so with, well, kinf0f like baby steps.... right. EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It is about making small adjustments to feed a good habit. EOS 0 0 23 Build up my confidence and not take things personally. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Building it in to your daily life will make you feel accomplished. EOS 0 0 25 Yeah, so true. EOS 0 1 26 [Self-disclosure] THis really helped me to get going in the past. EOS 0 0 27 I have a few ideas and go with my strength' s and abilities that I have already been successful in the past. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You will find those things that you know you want. EOS 0 0 29 Yeah, I like it. I guess I needed to just chat with someone and listen to myself. EOS 0 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] Always beleive in yourself! EOS 0 0 31 True, that is what my wonderful Wife tells me and that God has a plan for me. Thanks. EOS 0 1 32 [Greeting] You are welcome and everybody is rooting for you. EOS 0 0 33 That' s really true, Need to stop feeling sorry for myself. Thank you. This has been helpful. EOS 0 1 34 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Start doing things and they will grow friend.
4 1 0 [Question] hi how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Not good, i am very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i' m sorry. whats making you sad? EOS 4 0 3 My friend just stopped talking to me and she won' t tell me the reason why. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] has she communicated via text or messanger? or has all communication stopped? EOS 4 0 5 She stopped communicating completely. Doesn' t even reply to me texts. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] i' m so sorry to hear that. i had a friend do that to me right after the spring pandemic lockdown. did this happen recently? EOS 4 0 7 Yes, just this past week. How did you deal with your situation? EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] i was upset, but then after thinking about it more, i figured she just was overwhelmed with everything going on. i gave her the benefit of the doubt and texted happy birthday this summer and didn' t hear anything back. can you think of anything going on with her that might cause her to stop communicating? EOS 4 0 9 That' s too bad. I suppose that one should be able to let the other person know when you no; longer want to be friends with them. That way one can move on quickly. I am completely unaware. We haven' t had any argument of late so i am completely clueless. Wish she would just reach out. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] i can imagine it' s hard to put those feeling into words when you want to move on. EOS 4 0 11 Exactly. Do you know of any online resources that one can use to get through such situations? EOS 4 1 12 [Question] but, it' s left you feeling sad. how are things going otherwise? EOS 4 0 13 The other areas of my life are doing good. Just that the sadness is getting to me at times. EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i don' t know of any specific resources. i' m sorry. however, its good that things are going well otherwise. how are relationships with others in your life going? i have found that I focusd on other friendships more since my friend ghosted me. EOS 4 0 15 The other relationships are good even though i' m now more wary of people because i don' t know who could leave my life at any moment without notice. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s understandable but just because one person has left doesn' t mean that others will. EOS 4 0 17 Yes it doesn' t. But still, you never know who to trust anymore. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] trust is tricky. do you know brene brown? the researcher, author, TED talk researcher?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello, how may i help you today? EOS 2 0 1 hi. I am not sure I offended my close friend, I' m scared, he will see pictures of the car I bought for my wife today on my status. actually, I have initial plan to get the a as a birthday gift for my wife before he came to ask for the money. EOS 2 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] so you are scared your friend will get mad at you for buying your wife a car after he came asking for money from you? is that correct? EOS 2 0 3 I don' t know how to explain the matter, why I can' t borrow him the money. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] Have you talked to him recently? EOS 2 0 5 yes, you are on l ine with me. yes. EOS 2 1 6 [Question] Has he said anything about the car? EOS 2 0 7 no, he saw the post of the car on my status, but he did' nt say anything. EOS 2 1 8 [Question] do you think he is mad at you? EOS 2 0 9 yes, naturally he will congratulate me as he viewed the pictures. EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i know this can be a tough situation but I believe this situation will pass and everything will be ok between you to. do not let this stress you out or worry that he is mad everything will be ok. i would suggest asking him if he saw your post about the car and ask him if he is mad about it.
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Somewhat stressed but otherwise ok. How about you? EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I am great, it snowed and looks like Christmas here. Why are you so stressed? EOS 0 0 4 I' m developing romantic feelings for a friend but she doesn' t share those feelings with me in return. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. I have been there myself.. Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend? EOS 0 0 6 Yes, I had received that advice from someone and tried it but it didn' t help. We have been friends for a long time and I think it would be tough to smother these romantic feelings. EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Have you thought about talking with this friend about these feelings? EOS 0 0 8 I have but I' m sure she wouldn' t react very well and it could damage our relationship.. I' m also pretty sure she' s already aware. She' s pretty sharp. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well maybe you should address these feelings with her in a very relaxed public atmosphere. Just let her know that you really like her and you have realized that she has many of the qualities that you look for in a person to get serious with. However, you treasure your friendship more than anything and you do not want anything to come in between your friendship.... this way you have addressed your feelings, she knows how you feel and then should she decide to every take the friendship to the next step, she wouldn' t feel awkward. EOS 0 0 10 That sounds like a good plan. I do like having things out in the open instead of holding them in. My other thought was to maybe try to seek out a romantic partner that isn' t her so then maybe the feelings would go to another focus and it wouldn' t damage our relatinship. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a great idea. Have you been dating other people much? EOS 0 0 12 No, it has been difficult with the whole Corona virus thing. I have taken a large income hit and also I' m having trouble finding someone who wants to actually go do something. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes the Corona virus has really put a damper on all kinds of normal activities. Have you thought about joining like a group with similar interests as yourself? Maybe look for a local group that has a Facebook page and you can start with building friendships just by chatting online or even on the public page itself. Some of the best lasting relationships start out as friends with similar interests and then they blossom. EOS 0 0 14 I think I' ll give that a try. I could use a new hobby anyways. EOS 0 1 15 [Greeting] Sounds like a great plan, how are you feeling now?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that? EOS 0 0 21 being on the board gives me perks. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit? EOS 0 0 23 yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there' s an element of mutual manipulation. EOS 0 0 25 yes. EOS 0 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are definitely not the only person to feel this way! EOS 0 0 27 it' s a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power.. what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board. EOS 0 0 29 i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment. EOS 0 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] But that is rather manipulative of you. EOS 0 0 31 if you were me you would forget about him and the board. EOS 0 1 32 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I definitely would do that. EOS 0 0 33 thing is he is encouraging me to be like that. cuz it helps him too. okay. i' ll try to lay low and walk away from it. EOS 0 1 34 [Others] I think it' s time for a clear severance. Do you have any other people you are interested in? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 35 yes but it' s less than before cuz of Covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this - if that makes sense. EOS 0 1 36 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah I hear you. You feel that your options are rather more limited than previously because of the lockdown? EOS 0 0 37 yes. EOS 0 1 38 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is something I believe that most of us are feeling right now so I sympathise.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, is there anything I can help you with today? EOS 4 0 1 I am really depressed because of my recent break up. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Oh no, that is really sad. I know break ups can be very hard.. EOS 4 0 3 yeah. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel you are depressed about it? Were you together a long time? EOS 4 0 5 i was with her for more then 2 years and without her everthing seems incomplete. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I completely understand. I have had break ups too. They are never easy. EOS 4 0 7 what should i do now? EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Well, if the break up is still fresh, it will take some time before you start feeling yourself again. Breaking up with someone can be as devastating as a death. Because you mourn the loss of the person. What do you think you could do to help yourself feel better? EOS 4 0 9 that is very true. what i need right now is to distract my mind and think about something else. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] What kind of hobbies do you have? Or are you involved in sports or any type of other activities that you enjoy? EOS 4 0 11 i mostly play soccer. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That could be a great distraction. You could start practicing soccer again. You definitely have more time for it now. Do you have anyone you can talk to about the break up? Sometimes talking with a close friend or family member can help a lot too. EOS 4 0 13 I have my best friend and he is also helping me recover but my main issue is inner will power. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] Why do you say that? Are you focused on trying to get back with them? EOS 4 0 15 My mind is just not accepting the change. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] That is difficult. What caused the break up? Was it mutual? Or was it one sided?
5 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 5 0 1 am fine thank you. EOS 5 1 2 [Question] Is there anything that you would like to talk about? EOS 5 0 3 no, now am okay. EOS 5 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well I am happy to listen to any problems that you have.
0 0 0 I have anxiety about what avenue to take academically. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello! Don' t worry, I am here to help. So you are saying that you are not sure what career to study? EOS 0 0 2 I do have an idea about it but I am anxious about choosing wrong and boxing myself into something I wish I hadn' t chosen. EOS 0 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Even if you chose wrong, you will generally have plenty of time to make up your mind and choose something that you really like:), plus, you can reach out to academic advisors, for example. EOS 0 0 4 I suppose you' re right, I think I don' t have confidence in myself that what ever I do choose, I will be good at it. Good enough to make a life out of it. fear of failing myself because i lose interest in things over time. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently. EOS 0 0 6 but what if that thing is your career choice? EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is a totally normal aspect of human nature. It' s normal to get bored of things even if we really liked them at some point. Of course, some topics like those are more serious, but as I said, even if you chosed wrong, you can always change your major. EOS 0 0 8 I guess thats right. All I care about is helping others so as long as the choice i make supports that then it will be fine. thank you for your help. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] No problem, and it' s great that you like helping others. I am a firm believer that ultimately making others happy is what makes us happy. EOS 0 0 10 yes, it is very rewarding to do so, it should be a part of everyone' s life choices. i agree with you on that. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Remember to always keep a positive mindset. I am sure you will sort this out in no time. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 The season has me down. No family around. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Are you finding time to do things you enjoy by yourself? Any hobbies?
4 0 0 hi. hello!!??!!?? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] hello.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay just anxious. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that' s bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I believe i am going to fail all my finals for college. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] College finals are a stressful time for sure, I' m sure you' re doing your best to prepare. EOS 0 0 6 Yes i have been studying for hours everyday. sometimes it is hard to focus. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s best to take a short break to reset when you feel like your gears are grinding. EOS 0 0 8 that is true, but i feel guilty when i take breaks. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I often feel the same way when I' m not busy doing work. But sometimes you need that little break to get back into the zone and be more productive. EOS 0 0 10 I try to take multiple 5 min breaks throughout my studying but it usually turns into hours breaks lol. its hard to focus. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You sounds pretty stressed about it, make sure you' re getting enough sleep so you don' t get run down.
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello. I need some help. I have been depressed. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you doing today? Do have anything on your mind? Oh i see, well we can talk about that if you like. Has anything happened recently to make you feel this way? EOS 4 0 3 I am not doing very well. Very depressed with having to stay home because of the COVID - 19/ I will appreciate anything you can do to help me. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like social isolation is really weighing on you... EOS 4 0 5 Yes, it sure is. I feel so alone. I feel it will help to talk to an outsider. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Human being are social creatures by nature so please understand that the feelings that you are having are absolutely normal. So dont judge yourself or feel as if something is wrong with YOU. EOS 4 0 7 Sometimes it helps to a stranger - most of my friends feel as I do. I am sure you are right - I thank you for your support.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You mentioned your friends feel the same way you do... Have you guys thought about making trying to do a zoom party? EOS 4 0 9 No, we haven' t talked about that, but that is a great idea. I will talk to them to see how they feel about doing this. Thank you. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have a group of sister friends and we threw a zoom party. we scheduled it out and we decorated our own spaces and we made a spotify playlist that everyone contributed a song to and basically just had a video party. Do you think your frinds may like to try that with you? EOS 4 0 11 I feel somewhat better just thin. I feel a little better now. I look forward to talking with my friends about doing Zoom. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Be creative! Get silly! most important have fun! this is a hard year but its still a chance to make happy memories. Is there anything else on your mind? EOS 4 0 13 I will. Having fun is what I need in my life. I know it' s been a tough year for everyone. Thank you very much. Have a great day. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] Im so glad that I could help you out! You have a great day too! EOS 4 0 15 Thank you. My husband and I are going to go for a ride later. That will help. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Lovely! EOS 4 0 17 Thanks. I am looking forward to gettng out for a while. EOS 4 1 18 [Greeting] Bye friend(: Come back anytime if you ever wanna talk again!
3 0 0 Hello I am very sad today. My partner is cheating on me. EOS 3 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Cheating on you? EOS 3 0 2 Yes. With another woman. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is? EOS 3 0 4 I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] How long have you been in a relationship with your man? EOS 3 0 8 2 years. EOS 3 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating. EOS 3 0 10 What do you mean exactly?. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it. EOS 3 0 12 I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations. EOS 3 0 14 That is true. He is but, has been distant lately. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner. EOS 3 0 16 Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why. EOS 3 0 18 That is a good point.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that. EOS 3 0 20 I am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand. EOS 3 0 22 I should trust my partner more than any random person. EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters. EOS 3 0 24 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? EOS 3 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you.... even after work. EOS 3 0 26 okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. EOS 3 0 28 That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you? EOS 3 0 30 Okay. I will keep that in mind. We are 22. EOS 3 1 31 [Question] Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? EOS 3 0 32 Yes but less over the past few months. EOS 3 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related.... for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. EOS 3 0 34 That' s understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. EOS 3 1 35 [Providing Suggestions or Information] How do you all generally communicate? Through text? EOS 3 0 36 He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends.. EOS 3 1 37 [Question] Which do you and your man like to communicate? EOS 3 0 38 No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something. EOS 3 1 39 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot. EOS 3 0 40 You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help.. EOS 3 1 41 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you. EOS 3 0 42 Do you think getting other people involved is a good idea? EOS 3 1 43 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would be subtle about that tactic.. If you haven' t met any of his school mates. I wouldn' t pursue that option. Have you met any of his class mates? EOS 3 0 44 Yeah he has a few close friends but he is pretty to himself. We both live far away from home. EOS 3 1 45 [Question] Are you and him directly off campuses in housing? You both attend the same college, correct? EOS 3 0 46 Yes off campus. Same college. EOS 3 1 47 [Question] Where do you work? Have you seen the customer who said that your partner was cheating? Seen the customer before? Was it a man or woman who dropped the shocking news? I feel that the customer may have a case of mistaken identity indeed.

4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 i feel depresed. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Why do you feel depressed? EOS 4 0 3 breakup with my partner. EOS 4 1 4 [Others] Breakups can be really tough. How long were you with your partner? EOS 4 0 5 3years of time we have been in love. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I once had a relationship end after 5 years with a partner. Staying active really helped me get over the relationship. Through that activity I actually met my new partner! EOS 4 0 7 but i love my partner so much that i couldnt forget her right now. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about doing something fun, like taking a trip somewhere? EOS 4 0 9 yeah we went for trip we had a god relationship. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really difficult, but I know you can get through this! What do you like to do for fun?
5 1 0 [Question] Hi there. How are you today? EOS 5 0 1 I' m good. how r u? EOS 5 1 2 [Question] I' m doing good today. What brings you on here? EOS 5 0 3 I' m not happy with an ex friend who talks behind my back to my current friends. EOS 5 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] ugh. There' s nothing worse than that. Have you confronted the ex friend? EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking. EOS 5 1 6 [Question] oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it? EOS 5 0 7 they' re still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander. EOS 5 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s an option but I hope it doesn' t go that far again. Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend? EOS 5 0 9 no. i don' t want anything to do with her. if i find out my friends take her side they will be my ex friend too. EOS 5 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand that. You don' t want two people disrespecting you.. EOS 5 0 11 absolutely not. i have a strong constitution about myself and don' t allow to be disrespected by anyone. EOS 5 1 12 [Question] I hear that! What happened in court when you went? If you don' t mind me asking. EOS 5 0 13 i tried to get an order for her to stay away from me. the first judge passed it but the second judge said it wasn' t strong enough.. EOS 5 1 14 [Question] Sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can. Has she been in contact with you? EOS 5 0 15 no. she hasn' t done anything lately for me to get a court order. if she starts anything again i will get a lawyer and sue her. EOS 5 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Seems like a good idea. Steer clear of her and don' t associate with her! Sounds like you' re doing the right thing. Keep your side of the street clean.
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state. EOS 0 0 6 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well. EOS 0 0 8 Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing( which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all. I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out. EOS 0 0 10 What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job: it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. Working there would be ministry, not typical work. And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, that' s a big deal. i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it. EOS 0 0 12 Thank you. I believe there are three things in my favor: I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current( related) job fifteen years ago. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] even by working there, you will surely meet new friends. do you know many people from the church? EOS 0 0 14 We worked together for almost 13 years before she retired, but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer/ work partner? I know a few of the higher ups from the area churches, and a handful of families. I know half the core staff I would be working with daily and think of them as extended family.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you just have to be patient and don' t push it too hard so that you won' t look desperate.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that? EOS 0 0 21 being on the board gives me perks. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit? EOS 0 0 23 yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there' s an element of mutual manipulation.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello there, can I help you with any today?* anything. I am happy to talk to you about any problem that you might be having? EOS 4 0 1 I am having such a difficult time today!!! EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you. EOS 4 0 3 I think that my boyfriend is cheating on me again!!! EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Are you saying that he has cheated on you before? That does not sound very promising. EOS 4 0 5 He has but it was a long time ago and was before we had a talk about exclusivity in our relationship but it still hurt. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Have you considered getting some sort of couples counselling? Or do you just think that he is never going to change? EOS 4 0 7 We tried counselling once.. It was online and we got paid to do it.. I don' t think he took it seriously at the time. He always said he felt like he was being attacked. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. So you feel that he is not really taking your problems as a couple seriously? EOS 4 0 9 Yes. I feel he thinks of me as some sort of trophy and he does not have to work now that he won me over in the first place. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have been in toxic relationships before and to be honest it does sound a little as though this is one of those situations. EOS 4 0 11 I have been as well but this time was supposed to be different. At first everything was great but now things are so distant I just don' t know what to do next. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you feel that perhaps it might be time to move on? People who will cheat twice are pretty unlikely to ever change their ways. EOS 4 0 13 That is true. But now we have a kid together and I feel like it would break her heart to lose her dad. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah you did not mention that! Maybe for the sake of your child it might be worth going to counselling again then. EOS 4 0 15 Maybe but a place that we won' t get paid to go... I think he thought of it as a job or something. I got a lot out of the experience and still use the skills to this day. But with a unresponsive partner those skills will not work.. Can you recomend a good site to find affordable services? EOS 4 1 16 [Question] You could ask your doctor to recommend something that will not cost you too much but will be effective? EOS 4 0 17 That is a great idea I had not thought of asking my dr. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] They should be able to provide you with a list of reputable services local to you. I hope that I have managed to be of some use to you today!
3 0 0 hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hey. How are you? EOS 3 0 2 i am not feeling too great. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why not? EOS 3 0 4 i am not able to find a job for over 5 years. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] How have you been able to get by? EOS 3 0 6 i am on social assiatnce but its not enough and i feel so worthless. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If you keep trying things will work out in the end. EOS 3 0 8 but i have been tryin for so long, i dont know what ti do. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Perhaps you havent searched well enough, have you gone to many interviews? EOS 3 0 10 yes I did do a lot of interveiws but no one hired me. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps on the interviews you are doing something wrong, because it have been a while. EOS 3 0 12 i feel that i am not worthy and that no one thinks i am capable. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Dont think that. You are worthy, you just need to apply yourself in the right direction:) EOS 3 0 14 how can i do this. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps look for any job for now, even if they wage isn' t good, because you have to start with something. You need some work experience. EOS 3 0 16 i get depressed when i am rejected every time. EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it happens that you get rejected, but it is the opportunity to learn from your mistakes and go again:) EOS 3 0 18 do you have any tools that can help manage my depression. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try meditation as it is able to help you relax and assess your situation. EOS 3 0 20 how many times should i do this. EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe every day or a few times a week, depending on what you feel is necessary. EOS 3 0 22 okay i will try this and see if this works. shall i also try walking or exercsing. EOS 3 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, anything to take your mind of it:)
0 1 0 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today? EOS 0 0 1 I am so stressed out because my business has suffered this year. I am very worried I may have to close and I won' t be able to pay my bills. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is really tough. a lot of people are going through that, you are not alone. what kind of business do you have? EOS 0 0 3 I sell cosmetics. I think a lot of people don' t have money to buy non essential items right now. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] christmas is right around the corner though, and it is almost the 15th. military get paid the 1st and 15th so there is still hope for a christmas rush! tax season is right around the corner too... there is defineately still reason to keep hope. EOS 0 0 5 That might be true. I just don' t know that business will ever recover. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you online or in store? EOS 0 0 7 Mostly online. EOS 0 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] thats great then, online businesses are less likely to fail. you know, i am in construction and there are soo many zoom meetings. honestly, i was in an office with 4 people and hardly wore make up. now with all these meetings i amd doing meetings constantly and i have had to start wearing more make up to look more profesional. i know it can be scry, but you ust have to keep a positive attitude. EOS 0 0 9 Yeah we don' t have to shut down. But with so many people struggling to make ends meet, there just doesn' t seem to be enough left over to buy extra things. and that' s true. There are people on zooms that want to wear makeup. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] also, i think it depends on where you are in the world. covid hit my area really hard around april/ may, but things are completely back to normal now. people hardly wear masks, stores are open, it just takes time. EOS 0 0 11 That' s definitely not the case here. But I can see what you mean. EOS 0 1 12 [Others] maybe you could distritubute samples to hospitals for the nurses as a christmas present. put your card in. you KNOW they have job stability and it could lead to sales! EOS 0 0 13 That' s something to think about. EOS 0 1 14 [Others] if you have a facebook page you can always make a post saying you are giving back to the community by giving the essential workers chrismas gifts.... it could make people in your community want to support you back! EOS 0 0 15 Yeah that' s true too. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i think you will be fine. you are resourceful, you are supplementing income with mturk, thats awesome. you seem to have a good head on your shoulders.
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live.
3 1 0 [Question] hi there? EOS 3 0 1 Hi. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] how are you? what' s new with you?
0 0 0 Hello, is anone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Yes sorry, the app was misbehaving. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I don' t know. I' m shaking because I don' t know what I' m going to do. EOS 0 1 3 [Others] Im sorry to hear that, but going to do about what situation specifically? EOS 0 0 4 I know you' re busy prepping for the holiday but I described my problem earlier. It should be listed either at the top or on the left side of your screen. I know you' re probably prepping for the holiday. I didn' t mean to interrupt your Sunday. EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Im sorry but we do not get those promps. We just get to talk pretty much, we have to find out whats going on. You are not interrupting anything. EOS 0 0 6 Here! Last Christmas I bought the condo of my dreams. This April 2020 I lost my job due Covid 19. My unemployment is ending and my savings are depleted. I' ve recived an eviction notice and don' t know what to do. Help! Have you ever been evicted? EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Where are you that you are able to be evicted? You should not be able to be evicted from your home during this time in pretty much every state. Have you tried contacting anyone for help other than your landlord?
0 0 0 Hello. My name is Spike. What is yours? Is anyone there? I feel kind of sad and rejected that no one is answering. Is this part of the task? EOS 0 1 1 [Others] oh no i' m sorry i left you waited. please tell me your problem. EOS 0 0 2 I' m trying to make money on MTurk and starting a YouTube channel. Money is a big concern for me. EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] We are on the same boat. Do you have any other jobs? EOS 0 0 4 No. That' s my only income right now. It has led to a real crisis of self confidence to me. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you considered applying for a job or trying uber drive/ eats? EOS 0 0 6 I have. But I have health conditions that would mean Covid - 19 would be very risky for me to get. So, I' m trying to work online. I' m trying to stay encouraged. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand how you feel, it' s tough not being able to work and earn much money. However, you are doing your best right now and should feel proud of yourself. EOS 0 0 8 Thanks. I appreciate that. What do you do to stay encouraged or confident? EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I try to spend more time outdoor and keep myself busy. I like to cook since it' s very relaxing and helps keep my mind concentrated. EOS 0 0 10 cooking for me is just another chore. But getting outside might help. I live out in the country. So I have nice scenery. EOS 0 1 11 [Others] That is perfect then, the nature is very healing. You can also hang out with friends and talk to them about how you feel. EOS 0 0 12 It has been days since I even sat on the porch. And weeks since I took a walk. EOS 0 1 13 [Others] you should definitely do that. staying indoor will worsen your mentality. EOS 0 0 14 That' s a good idea. What sort of projects are you working on? Job? Hobby? EOS 0 1 15 [Self-disclosure] yeah I have a full time job and working on mturk at night. Covid has hit me financially too. EOS 0 0 16 Wow. that' s a lot. EOS 0 1 17 [Others] we all face different pressure and have to find ways around it.
3 0 0 Hi, How are you doing? I am in bad mood.. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] What' s wrong? EOS 3 0 2 This work from home tension and cant go out with my family and parties. It makes me depressed and cant bear this pathedic situation. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. I, too, am struggling with COVID - 19. It' s going to be difficult not to see family during the holidays. We' ll get through this, though, don' t you think. Have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone? Maybe there is a way to find ways to have fun online with your friends and family. We actually played games together recently. Is that something you could do to reconnect? EOS 3 0 4 I am fully occupied with my job. This software field sucks me. Even weekends also they are expecting to work with offshore people. I dont find the time to spend with my partner and kids. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there any way you could talk to your supervisor about achieving a better work life balance? EOS 3 0 6 Yeah! Good Idea, I ll make a call with my Manager once. It could be better to have vacation for a week. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that could make a big difference in changing things for you. You just need a better work/ life balance to straighten things out. I had a similar experience in the past, and talking with my manager about time off reinvigorated me. EOS 3 0 8 Exactly. Please suggest me any idea to spend my time with my family and away from this work pressure. Sounds good! I ll arrange a conversation with my head then. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] With COVID - 19, it may limit your options, but you could decide which activities you would collectively enjoy the most, and try to do them as often as possible together. EOS 3 0 10 Absolutely, then i ll help my family with household chores and make them free. Then we have some quality time to spend together! EOS 3 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, giving them a helping hand, getting things done together, could greatly improve your home life. Are you feeling any better since we started chatting?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello.:) How are you? EOS 0 0 1 I am okay. A little anxious I am feeling helpless. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am sorry to hear that. What are you feeling helpless about? EOS 0 0 3 I am worried about upcoming bills. I lost my job. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I see. I would be worried about that as well. How long have you been out of work? EOS 0 0 5 About 2 weeks. Christmas is right around the corner. I dont know how I am going to get the kids presents. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anyone you are able to ask for support right now, like your parents? I am sure they would understand, since so many people have been losing jobs lately.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hello, thank you for signing up to listen to me. I could be better but thank you for asking. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What' s on your mind?
2 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you feeling today? EOS 2 0 1 Hi. I' m feeling okayish. EOS 2 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest. EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely. I recently broke up with my girlfriend. We had been together for more than 3 years. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] What happened that made you guys break up?
0 1 0 [Question] hello how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hello I am taking a break from my studies to talk. I am fine thanks. Hope you are doing well also. I am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines. EOS 0 1 2 [Self-disclosure] i am fine thanks for asking. EOS 0 0 3 two exams and two assignments due at the end of this and next month. that' s good. EOS 0 1 4 [Others] Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful. EOS 0 0 5 yeah I have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it' s online and basically I do things on my own time.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you taking a lot of courses? EOS 0 0 7 2 courses. but I am pretty much using full time capacity on them. devoting full - time I mean. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] do you like doing school online better than in person?
0 0 0 Hello? Is anyone there? Is anyone there. HELLO? no one is supporting me here..:: twiddles thumbs:: the instructions for the support seeker are incorrect as there is no button that has shown for" the partner' s reasons".. the supporter did not respond. This test is skewed. No one is here to chat with. even after being matched. Ridiculous. hello????? hello? no other messages except my own are showing up. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Sorry, I had a bad connection. Hello, what can I help you with? EOS 0 0 2 Hi. i wasn' t sure anyone was there. i left my job about three months after 8 years.. haven' t found another one.. trying to find one has been challenging. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Just be clear, you' re worried about finding a new job? EOS 0 0 4 well, yeah. in the middle of a pandemic, and being in a new town. all of that has been really hard. and stressful. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a difficult position to be in. It is a hard time, but there' s always a way to persevere. EOS 0 0 6 yeah... i don' t know... i' m not sleeping well because i' m so worried. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I could imagine that being a constant worry. I understand how you may feel.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling pretty good right now.. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk to me about? EOS 4 0 3 I have a friend who knew me since I was little. She is a little older than me. She still treat me like I' m still little. I tried to explain to her that I' m a grown woman and I grew out of lot of things when I was a kid.. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Is she listening to you? I know how it feels to be patronised by people who are older. EOS 4 0 5 She still didn' t get it. I want our relationship to move further but with her like this. I feel sad. Is there anything I can do? EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Well, if she is not listening to you when you try to talk to her you have to ask yourself whether the relationship is really worth it? EOS 4 0 7 That' s true. I didn' t think about it. Should I approach her and talk about it before? EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I think it' s always worth fighting for a friendship but there does come a point when it stops being at all viable. EOS 4 0 9 Yeah, that' s definitely true. I know she is a good person. So I would give her a chance and we can talk about it before. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Does she have younger siblings? I am the eldest of four and I sometimes, even at age forty five, find myself trying to tell them what to do. EOS 4 0 11 She have a younger brother that is 9 years younger. She used to be only child for a while before her brother was born.. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It could be the cause of her behaviour. EOS 4 0 13 Maybe that' s why. She have different personality than me. She is more into logical thinking and she love people and has bubbly personality. While I' m emotional but are social butterfly and after a while, I would need a break from people.. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] How much would it hurt you to end the friendship? Do you think you could make other friends and survive it or is it worth fighting for? EOS 4 0 15 To be honest, there are some times when she made me cry or mad when I get home. I think that over the time and the more older I get, the more I would knowledge my relationship with her.. EOS 4 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] I know that I don' t know her but to be honest it does sound to me like your friendship is a bit toxic.. EOS 4 0 17 I do have other friends that I could purse the relationship farther. I think I just felt bad that I known her for years and she is a good person. It' s just not what I need right now.. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes we really just have to let things go. I know it' s hard but it will probably good for your mental health. I hope that I have been able to help you today! It' s a difficult situation for sure. EOS 4 0 19 Yeah, thank you! You certainly helped me.. EOS 4 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have a great rest of day:) EOS 4 0 21 You too! Stay safe and healthy!. EOS 4 1 22 [Question] ( can you press quit from your end; I am not allowed to do it from mine. Cheers!)

EOS 6 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You have got such a nice girlfriend, have a happy life with her. EOS 6 0 14 but think about her mom how could i handle her. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Dont worry, just tell your girlfriend directly about the incident of how her mom is behaving towards you with a proof if you could. Or else be bold enough to warn her mom regarding this. EOS 6 0 16 yes im going to warn her. EOS 6 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] You have such a nice girlfriend my dear friend, so cheating her is not at all fair. Yes, go ahead, the problems will vanish. EOS 6 0 18 yeah i can understand.

EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently? EOS 4 0 5 It is over permanently... EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah I guess, the relationship was a little toxic and she sometimes only used me for money. Maybe is it for the best now that I think about it. EOS 4 1 8 [Others] Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!! EOS 4 0 9 Yeah I just miss having someone there for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] All you need now is to give yourself some TLC.. treat yourself to something nice and go easy on yourself. EOS 4 0 11 What is TLC. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] There will be someone else. I never thought I' d find anyone else but I did and we' ve been together ten years ago now! Tender Loving Care:) Means be good to yourself. EOS 4 0 13 Ok yeah your story is very inspirational to me. Maybe this was needed in order to find the right person. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anything you can do to distract yourself right now? Plan a holiday or take a night class or something? EOS 4 0 15 I am now doing mturk to get my mind off of it to make some extra money. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Save up what you make and buy yourself something nice?
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 3 0 2 Not feeling good. Trying to find a job but no success. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] It' s a really hard time to be finding new work isn' t it? Are you getting unemployment or anything? EOS 3 0 4 I am getting unemployment but that is not sufficient with 6 children. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wow that' s a lot of kids. Do you know that there are foodbanks out there which might be able to help you? EOS 3 0 6 As a single mother It' s pretty hard to go to search for food bank. I am spending most of my time in looking for a job. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are there any organisations that you could just call and explain your predicament to? EOS 3 0 8 I don' t know any as I never faced such situation before and my partner was there to support the family. Now there is no support of him. life is becoming misearable. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Do you have friends who could help you, even with child care? EOS 3 0 10 One of my friends was really helpful. She moved to different city last month. After that I am totally shattered. EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine that that must have been traumatic. You will make new friends though. EOS 3 0 12 Life is becoming hard day by day. I am feeling guilty that I can' t feed my kids well. No one wants to do friendship with poor people.

2 1 0 [Question] hi! how are you doing today> EOS 2 0 1 Hello, I' m doing okay, wbu? EOS 2 1 2 [Others] ok it' s been a stressful time for most of us but we are all doing the best we can. EOS 2 0 3 Yeah that' s true. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] whats been the weirdest part of the pandemic for you? EOS 2 0 5 So I live with my boyfriend and my bestfriend. And I am afraid they are doing skethy stuff behind my back. It sounds crazy, and I don' t have any proof but I have this feeling. The way they talk around each other makes me nervous. EOS 2 1 6 [Question] hmm, tell me more. what do you think is going on? EOS 2 0 7 I' m scared when it is just the two of them here at home. And they are jsut so much more friendly together than before we moved in. EOS 2 1 8 [Question] living together can make people more comfortable with each other. has there been something specific that has caused you to wonder about them> EOS 2 0 9 Not really specifics. It' s more of a just in general sort of thing. I know them both really really well, so I am just picking up on tiny little details. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] i hear you. have you said anything to either one of them? EOS 2 0 11 I have talked to my boyfriend, but he just tells me that it' s crazy I would think something like that. Idk... I don' t want to sound crazy and blow it out of proportion if it' s really nothing. I don' t know if there is actually something I should be worried about, or if I am thinking these crazy thoughts for other reasons. EOS 2 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] having doubts about relationships is rough. do you know brene brown? EOS 2 0 13 I don' t know who that is. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she researches shame and vunerability.
0 0 0 Hi. Is anyone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hi there.
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started. EOS 0 0 14 ok, I will look into the grocery method. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Just from chatting with you, you seem to be very open to suggestions and are devoted to making it through these crazy times. Has your work life been affected by the pandemic? EOS 0 0 16 so literally, I only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. I only started a new work in September, and it' s not much( about two days a week), so I can' t comment too much about that. It is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps. EOS 0 0 18 so I get nervous in general when I am at work but I do my work just the same. May not be able to work as well because I have to breathe through a mask, and some other small difficulties. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is good that you can continue to do your work the same. EOS 0 0 20 Thank you for all the positive messages so far and in understanding and sympathizing with me.. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] Is there anything else I should know about how the pandemic is affecting you? EOS 0 0 22 pretty much. If anything, it' s my academic life at home that has changed not so well.. EOS 0 1 23 [Question] Are you a student? EOS 0 0 24 yes, I take online courses and I tend to procrastinate a lot more and get distracted as I find myself more and more at home. Just getting carried away and now have impending deadlines.. I can get through it but it has had a toll on my productivity.. I was just taking my sweet time with it and that wasn' t good. EOS 0 1 25 [Self-disclosure] I am also a student and am not motivated to do school work at home, so I completely understand. I am sure you are successful at school! Having a planner may keep you organized and on - task. Dedicating a certain time frame and area for school work might help, as well.. EOS 0 0 26 Because prior to the pandemic, I was pretty regimented with set schedules and can clear my mind with work - outs and going to the gym and movies, but now it' s not that simple.. EOS 0 1 27 [Question] Is there anything else I can help you with? EOS 0 0 28 Thank you and I hope your schooling goes well also.. EOS 0 1 29 [Greeting] Thank you, you too! EOS 0 0 30 yeah I like your idea of dedicating the time. I find that I am slacking off and being disorganized in areas like time management. So yes I have to improve on that.. I suppose you have been doing your schooling relatively better in your situation?. I hope you do anyhow. EOS 0 1 31 [Question] Great ideas! Is there anything else I can help you with? EOS 0 0 32 would you have any other advice on how to overcome things like time management with academics? like how to avoid procrastination? Because this was so much better in the past that I just had set schedules and can clear my mind by going out, etc.. and feeling refreshed and feeling the urgency to study again.. But that' s gone for me now.. EOS 0 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would reccomend setting deadlines in your planner of when tasks need to be completed and also setting timers for 20 minutes at a time where you have to focus for that long before you can do any other task.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Nice to meet you Jim, I am doing well. Is there anything you' d like to talk about today?
0 1 0 [Question] hello how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hello I am taking a break from my studies to talk. I am fine thanks. Hope you are doing well also. I am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines. EOS 0 1 2 [Self-disclosure] i am fine thanks for asking. EOS 0 0 3 two exams and two assignments due at the end of this and next month. that' s good. EOS 0 1 4 [Others] Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful. EOS 0 0 5 yeah I have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it' s online and basically I do things on my own time.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you taking a lot of courses? EOS 0 0 7 2 courses. but I am pretty much using full time capacity on them. devoting full - time I mean. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] do you like doing school online better than in person? EOS 0 0 9 Have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good the more time you have to devote the better! EOS 0 0 11 I have done both methods. I definitely prefer in - school studies.. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel it is more stressful online? EOS 0 0 13 I am just disappointed that I have been slacking off and procrastinating. no it' s just that it' s a different avenue. I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. I think it' s because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow.. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after. EOS 0 0 15 yeah I take breaks in between.. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Yea this pandemic has me not as motivated to. EOS 0 0 17 But sometimes a lot more breaks or longer breaks than intended or I should. yeah definitely. Sorry to hear that.. It' s like everyday is the same and I can' t go out to refresh my mind or have a change of pace such as going to the gym or go out for a run. whereas before the pandemic, I can switch gears that way and come back refreshed. like going out to the movies and coming back with renewed enthusiasm. EOS 0 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Yea i have been missing the gym myself. Now i lookup youtube videos of workouts and do them, and it really helps to get me going in the day. Do you ever listen to music while you are trying to get work done? When i do that it tends to help time go faster and i get more done. EOS 0 0 19 I see. Yeah it' s good to have a routine and good way to resume life as usual.. sometimes I listen to music but I find it hard to read and absorb and listen to music. But I do listen to music sometimes when I am on assignments.. I also tend to drink coffee to focus my mind better. It does help. And I know I can pass the courses and on time but just that I am disappointed at my performance and work ethics as I know I have done much better before. So I am missing that sense of urgency, conscientiousness, and maturity., EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe find a nice meditation song to help relax you, i find when i am doing something finding a song with no words is better so i am able to concentrate. EOS 0 0 21 I see. That' s a good idea. I was also thinking I should have a regular workout routine at home again because I used to work out much more daily, even at home.. EOS 0 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are a very smart person and are able to acknowledge when you need to work harder on something. Don' t be to hard on yourself this pandemic is affecting everyone. EOS 0 0 23 working out does help me focus and be productive.. Thank you and I do agree with you on the pandemic. But this is a part of my mistake too but I think coming away from our conversation, I am more optimistic now having talked to someone about it.. EOS 0 1 24 [Self-disclosure] Yes i would imagine that would help to, i found that before i started working out at home i was beginning to feel lazy and not getting anything done, but that has all changed now. EOS 0 0 25 I see. Hopefully your routines are much better and more productive now. EOS 0 1 26 [Others] Aww well try not to be to hard on yourself. Set some daily goals and i bet you will be back to feeling normal in no time. I am glad talking has helped! EOS 0 0 27 yeah that' s another thing. It does work better for me if I were to write down some sort of itinerary of what I should get through today, etc. So you' re right.. well thank you for listening then and providing some very helpful input.. Yeah you' ve been more than helpful! Thank you.. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are welcome, best of luck with all your studies!
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 hello. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 0 0 3 I need ways alleviate stress while studying. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there. EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck. EOS 0 0 7 How did you push past that job? EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work. EOS 0 0 9 Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career? EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too. EOS 0 0 11 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Can you give me some more details?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability. EOS 3 0 21 i applied for disability but didn' t get it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself. EOS 3 0 23 yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn' t matter. EOS 3 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Social Security stopped you. Why? EOS 3 0 25 i' m not injured enough for them. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can file against the company if you can prove neglect in the employer.. Were there proper safety guards. EOS 3 0 27 I tried but since it is the state of PA they have immunity. no. EOS 3 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was a state injury, there must be an avenue you can use to prove neglect. EOS 3 0 29 I was told that I assumed the risk of injury working for them. It was a mental hospital. EOS 3 1 30 [Question] have you contacted OSHA and filed a complaint with them? EOS 3 0 31 not yet. I should. EOS 3 1 32 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There should be an avenue for you to seek compensation. EOS 3 0 33 The lawyer fought with them for over a year. There was even an appeal but I lost that too. EOS 3 1 34 [Reflection of feelings] It is unfortunate that safety is not a factor. It was a state hospital? EOS 3 0 35 yes. EOS 3 1 36 [Question] Did a patient attack you? EOS 3 0 37 yes. EOS 3 1 38 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There must be liability concerning your injury. EOS 3 0 39 I can' t go after the patient because they are mentally incompetent so I' m out of ideas. EOS 3 1 40 [Question] But what about the family? EOS 3 0 41 I don' t know if the person had one anymore. EOS 3 1 42 [Question] Is the patient a ward of the state. EOS 3 0 43 yes. EOS 3 1 44 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So the patient' s family either gave the person up or the patient was placed there by the state right?
3 0 0 I' m so depressed, I just got layed off. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I am sorry to hear that, did you apply for unemployment benefit? That at least can help you financially until you get a new job.
3 1 0 [Greeting] hello!! EOS 3 0 1 I am very depressed. I found out that my girlfriend is cheating on me with my friend! EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] that' s really bad. even I was also in the same situation. EOS 3 0 3 I have been with her for close to 2 years and now she has been cheating me right under my nose for the past few months! how foolish of me to blindly trust her... How did you deal with it? EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] To be honest i was not completely came out it since it was 3 years but now i somehow getting better i tried to divert myself from the thoughts engage myself with other friends spend more time with my family like that. try to divert yourself, keep yourself busy, spend more time with family, try to minimize the usage of mobile. EOS 3 0 5 But my family is away from me in another country. I can' t even go back due to this stupid covid! I feel betrayed and like dying. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] yeah I could understand your feelings right now. EOS 3 0 7 I actually broke my phone in anger and damaged her credit card. I feel like slapping both of them so hard that they forget where they came from! but I can' t do anything. I am helpless. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah its really hard to handle this state of mind but we need to. EOS 3 0 9 Why are girls like this? EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t know but some girls were playing with a guys intense feelings. EOS 3 0 11 I know, right! Should I move on or should I take revenge? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think the best way is to move on.
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Much better than normal, even though the stock market is down. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Are you an investor? EOS 0 0 3 I am a student that tries to put as much money into as possible. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand the struggle with being at that stage in life. Has this affected you negatively? EOS 0 0 5 No the stock market really doesn' t cause stress for me, mostly just small things that I think my brain overreacts to. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] What sorts of things? EOS 0 0 7 Kind of a variety of things. I typically get bad anxiety after a night of going out. So I am trying to cut out drinking. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety? Do you suffer from anxiety when you do not drink ever? EOS 0 0 9 Sometimes but I think the root from them comes from when I do something while I' m drinking. Not that I do anything bad, but I just don' t like not remembering things. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] So you would say that you drink to the point of blacking out? Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you' ve had a reasonable amount of alcohol? EOS 0 0 11 I used to black out a lot, but I have tried to control it by cutting the former amount of drinks I consumed in half, if I do choose to go out. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I have drank to the point of blacking out several times in my life mostly when I was younger and I found that it either came from a certain type of alcohol or mixing different types. Have you noticed it could be related to that or simply the amount of alcohol you are drinking?. EOS 0 0 13 It is typically the amount I' m drinking, but cutting out drinking as a whole has probably helped me the most. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Certainly making sure that you only drink a certain amount like a couple drinks of beer or only a shot of harder drinks might alleviate this or refraining from mixing drinks. Sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep... the amount you drink. Do your friends encourage you to drink more?
1 0 0 I' m having issues with my parents. You can say we are having a conflict. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] What kind of issues do you think you are having? EOS 1 0 2 well they won' t allow me to date this girl i met online.. They told she' s bad news. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today. Have you tried talking to you parents about why she is" bad news"? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, i tried but it won' t get through their head. There are so old school. They want me to date someone close to my age. is 15 year difference too big of a gap? EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] The basic problem is that your parents believe that 15 years is too large of an age gap between you guys. Is there any other reasons your parents dissaporve of her? EOS 1 0 6 They told me she' s gold digger. Yes i come from money but hey this girl is the one.. EOS 1 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You believe that the girl is not a gold digger, but instead you guys like each other for who you are. Money is not an issue for you guys? EOS 1 0 8 nope not at all. hmm well she does ask to use my credit card alot. my parents foot the bill.. EOS 1 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps you should try to talk to your parents around this fact. For example, if money is the problem for your parents, you can set some rules. LIke you can set an allowance for how much money you can use each week. EOS 1 0 10 Ok, i will talk to them this weekend. what' s better on the phone or in person? EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you want a better communication, I believe in person will be best. EOS 1 0 12 hate talking to my parents face to face, all they do is yell and i get frustrated. EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I apologize and I do agree it is sometimes difficult. Perhaps it will be better to talk to them with another person present. EOS 1 0 14 That' s a great idiea. i will bring my g. f or is that a bad idea?. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If another person is present, it may make it easier. However, I believe it should be someone that is not invovled in this issue. Perhaps another family member or a close family friend. EOS 1 0 16 gotcha. i will bring my good friend. i' m sure he can help me out. great advice by the way. i' m so mad though why my parents care who i date. man i' m old enough. let me make my choices. EOS 1 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Parents have a difficult time understanding their child at times. Hopefully, through this you all can become closer. EOS 1 0 18 Thank you it will. will talk to them this weeked with a friend present. wish me luck:) EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I personally understand how difficult this can be. But if this works out. You can have a good family relationship and maintain a good relationship with your girlfriend. Best of luck!

EOS 0 0 3 im feeling very overwhelmed and cant get anything done cause i dont know where to start! i want to declutter my house but dont know where to start. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I hear you, feeling overwhelmed and like you don' t know where to start can leave a person feeling stressd forsure! Decluttering sounds like a great idea! Sometimes taking baby steps is a good place to start! EOS 0 0 5 but there are so many thinggs to do and ideas i have. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Of course! It can feel so stressful when we have all these little things we want to do but don' t know where to start! EOS 0 0 7 should i start in one room or one group of things and collect them from all the rooms? EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What is one little area that maybe seems easier to start with? Yeah, that' s a great idea! EOS 0 0 9 well i seem to start and them i end up jumoing to another thing! jumping.

EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried maybe using a timer or making a list to help keep you focused on decluttering one area at a time? Of course!

Get some good rest and I wish you luck with everything! EOS 0 0 25 are u still there. do you think making lists are a good idea. EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes! Making lists can be a great idea and help organize some thoughts and ideas you have in your head.
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus. EOS 3 0 9 yep. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] were you covered by workman' s comp. EOS 3 0 11 yeah. I went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so I lost my job. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I am in Georgia heading to Virginia. Heavy virus there. EOS 3 0 13 which? EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit. EOS 3 0 17 hopefully vaccine is avail soon. EOS 3 1 18 [Reflection of feelings] Wow and the court sided with the employer. EOS 3 0 19 yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn' t injured. EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You can draw unemployment and disability. EOS 3 0 21 i applied for disability but didn' t get it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] Did you have a lawyer yourself. EOS 3 0 23 yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn' t matter. EOS 3 1 24 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Social Security stopped you. Why? EOS 3 0 25 i' m not injured enough for them. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can file against the company if you can prove neglect in the employer.. Were there proper safety guards. EOS 3 0 27 I tried but since it is the state of PA they have immunity. no. EOS 3 1 28 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So it was a state injury, there must be an avenue you can use to prove neglect. EOS 3 0 29 I was told that I assumed the risk of injury working for them. It was a mental hospital. EOS 3 1 30 [Question] have you contacted OSHA and filed a complaint with them? EOS 3 0 31 not yet. I should. EOS 3 1 32 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There should be an avenue for you to seek compensation. EOS 3 0 33 The lawyer fought with them for over a year. There was even an appeal but I lost that too. EOS 3 1 34 [Reflection of feelings] It is unfortunate that safety is not a factor. It was a state hospital? EOS 3 0 35 yes. EOS 3 1 36 [Question] Did a patient attack you? EOS 3 0 37 yes. EOS 3 1 38 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There must be liability concerning your injury. EOS 3 0 39 I can' t go after the patient because they are mentally incompetent so I' m out of ideas. EOS 3 1 40 [Question] But what about the family?
3 0 0 Hi, How are you doing? I am in bad mood.. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] What' s wrong? EOS 3 0 2 This work from home tension and cant go out with my family and parties. It makes me depressed and cant bear this pathedic situation. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. I, too, am struggling with COVID - 19. It' s going to be difficult not to see family during the holidays. We' ll get through this, though, don' t you think. Have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone? Maybe there is a way to find ways to have fun online with your friends and family. We actually played games together recently. Is that something you could do to reconnect? EOS 3 0 4 I am fully occupied with my job. This software field sucks me. Even weekends also they are expecting to work with offshore people. I dont find the time to spend with my partner and kids. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there any way you could talk to your supervisor about achieving a better work life balance? EOS 3 0 6 Yeah! Good Idea, I ll make a call with my Manager once. It could be better to have vacation for a week. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that could make a big difference in changing things for you. You just need a better work/ life balance to straighten things out. I had a similar experience in the past, and talking with my manager about time off reinvigorated me. EOS 3 0 8 Exactly. Please suggest me any idea to spend my time with my family and away from this work pressure. Sounds good! I ll arrange a conversation with my head then. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] With COVID - 19, it may limit your options, but you could decide which activities you would collectively enjoy the most, and try to do them as often as possible together. EOS 3 0 10 Absolutely, then i ll help my family with household chores and make them free. Then we have some quality time to spend together! EOS 3 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, giving them a helping hand, getting things done together, could greatly improve your home life. Are you feeling any better since we started chatting? EOS 3 0 12 yeah! Thank you so much! It is good to have a conversation with you! Now I am feeling better. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] That' s terrific to here. I' m happy you' re feeling better. hear* - sorry for the misspelling.:) EOS 3 0 14 Hah hah! It' s Ok, We can Quit this conversation now! Thanks once again!!: -) EOS 3 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] Anytime! It was nice meeting you. Bye - now.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you today? EOS 3 0 1 hi i am okay, a little bit sad though. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Okay. I am very sorry to hear that! Do you want to tell me more about that? EOS 3 0 3 Well with the holidays coming up i have been very stressed and nervous about what i am going to do. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really feel you there. Holidays are so hard.. especially with the way this year has been. Anything specific?. EOS 3 0 5 Yes. I am a college student and I live on campus. The day before I moved in my dad said some unforgivable things to me and we haven' t spoke since. I have no choice but to go live at home over the break but I am very scared about it. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Do you feel scared for your own self? Or of the situation in general? I' m sorry to hear that. Relationships with parents can be very difficult sometimes.. I' m around college age as well and also live at home. So I can understand your struggle. EOS 3 0 7 more for the situation in general. i know we will not speak but we will constantly be running into each other, my house is not big. and i have no car to escape it. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] It' s like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it' s such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you' re not positive in. I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely.. It' ll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets? EOS 3 0 9 Thank you I appreciate that. I will be fine making it over the thanksgiving break but I am more nervous about covid - 19 sending us home for good.. Not many to be honest. I have a hamster but he is at school with me so nothing at home to go back to. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like Covid - 19 is going to be a personal stressor for you. It' s such a strange thing to have to live with already, the pandemic, and i' m sorry that it might end up pushing you where you don' t want to be. Could you bring your hamster home with you? Even the smallest things could help a place feel more loving.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you today? EOS 3 0 1 hi i am okay, a little bit sad though. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Okay. I am very sorry to hear that! Do you want to tell me more about that? EOS 3 0 3 Well with the holidays coming up i have been very stressed and nervous about what i am going to do. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really feel you there. Holidays are so hard.. especially with the way this year has been. Anything specific?.
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m really stressed with school exams. and I' m struggling with anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Ah that sounds tough, why exactly are you stressed? EOS 0 0 4 I have 3 big exams coming up at the same time, and they' re all really important for my final grade. I know I' m going to badly because I haven' t been learning well during the pandemic. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Okay, I understand, I see how that can also make your anxiety worse. Currently, on a scale of 1 - 10 how well are you understanding your course material? EOS 0 0 6 Probably 4. My roommates are just so loud and inconsiderate, I can' t make any progress studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s completely normal you haven' t made any progress. That would make things so hard and I applaud you for coming so far with that going on! EOS 0 0 8 I guess so. But if I fail or do badly on my exams it' s really not going to be good. I' m on a scholarship and have to keep above a 3. 0 gpa. EOS 0 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Would you say your problems start with your roommates? EOS 0 0 10 They' re the biggest problem right now. But I think having to learn from home is the main problem. It' s so hard in a tiny room with just a laptop. No library, no office hours, no study groups. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand, the same goes for me. It can be hard to keep up with grade expectations especially when money is on the line. EOS 0 0 12 Are you a student too? EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] Yes, and I completely get it! Its so hard to self - manage without the right resources. EOS 0 0 14 Yeah, I wish the professors and university would be more flexible. When the pandemic first started, we didn' t have grades, and that was really helpful. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] Ah and then they started rolling in, correct?
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing. EOS 6 0 8 Yeah, people don' t know that just because my two friends go" Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two( so - called) friends? EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] definatly not... have you tried explaining your situation to them? EOS 6 0 10 No, they don' t know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID - 19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time? EOS 6 0 12 I might be able to do that. EOS 6 1 13 [Others] unfortunatly it is right now very comen this situation, so no shame for that, EOS 6 0 14 Well, I used to donate a LOT in year' s past. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] a lot of times donating time to help organisatiosn is more valuable then money. EOS 6 0 16 Great point. EOS 6 1 17 [Others] times and situations change so thats ok. EOS 6 0 18 My friends may like to know that I am trading time.... instead of donating money. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i worked for a non profit and the biggest struggle was to find volunteers to help out. EOS 6 0 20 Yes, you make a good point. EOS 6 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I feel that is a great donation and if they do not like that tell them money is easy to give time not. EOS 6 0 22 The proble is that some people just want to shame people without knowing their plight. EOS 6 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, true, we need to stay above them then in all actuality we don' t know what goes on behind closed doors in their life. sometimes people like that reflect. EOS 6 0 24 I need to think of others ways to contribute that won' t have my friends hating on me. I have pride, too. EOS 6 1 25 [Others] BUt it should be what you want not what your' freinds want. you should be proud of yourself. EOS 6 0 26 Yeah...... EOS 6 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hopefully next year will bring better things and maybe even a better friend that does not judge into your life. EOS 6 0 28 The problem is that I am not sure it my friends are going to believe me; I am a well - to - do individual. We can only hope for a better 2021. Not sure how quickly the markets rebound.... EOS 6 1 29 [Others] well if they do not believe you as well you might really need to rethink your friendships and the meaning in those so called freind ships. hopefully soon for all of us, but hold on to the thought of being healthy. EOS 6 0 30 Well, I usually go to their get - togethers. Both of my friends are well - to - do. EOS 6 1 31 [Others] I am hoping you will find the right solution.
0 0 0 Hi how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I' m doing fine, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 Doing ok, thanks. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] thats good what do you have planned for the holidays? EOS 0 0 4 Not a whole lot due to the economic hardship my family and I are facing. How about you?. as far as holiday plans. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I completely understand that i feel that pain as well. are you there? EOS 0 0 6 oh I am sorry to hear that. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s ok there are plenty of other things that you can do with family during this time.
1 0 0 Hi. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello though, how has life been treating you lately? EOS 1 0 2 It' s been a pretty crazy year. I' m mostly bummed because of my work. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It has been a really weird year hasn' t it? Don' t worry, I think it' s been the same for all of us. Would you like to tell me more details? EOS 1 0 4 Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else' s pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss( the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That really sucks! I can understand why you are angry and anxious about this and you have every right to be!. Are there any official routes that you can use to complain? EOS 1 0 6 I work in supply chain and I see the actual sales numbers and realized 4 months ago that we were actually on track to exceed our plans, even with the covid reductions. a few weeks later I heard him tell our sales director to keep the numbers artificially low so that they will both get their bonuses. I don' t think so... He' s the VP there isn' t anyone I can go to above him. EOS 1 1 7 [Others] That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint?. It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this. EOS 1 0 8 I don' t know if it is or not... I used my EAP benefit through work where you can talk to a councilor for free( 5 visits) and they said that it' s unfortunate but they didn' t think it was illegal. EOS 1 1 9 [Others] I am very sorry to hear that, that sounds extremely unfair to me. Have you considered looking for another job? I realise it' s a very difficult time to be looking for work right now though.
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, what brings you to bring the seeker? EOS 6 0 1 I feel upset with myself over my situation. Did you read it? EOS 6 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I did not see it. What is your situation? I am here to listen. EOS 6 0 3 I feel ashamed of my depression symptoms. I feel other people are ashamed of me. EOS 6 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how? EOS 6 0 5 I just can' t live reguarly life like" healthy" people do and they notice my symptoms. They don' t understand how your mind can be your enemy. EOS 6 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are saying that you can' t live regularly and people don' t understand that your mind isn' t working in your favor. Is that right? Can you tell me what you mean by your mind being your enemy? EOS 6 0 7 Like I have no interest or motivation to do ANYTHING some days. Hard to even take care of my hygiene. My mind doesn' t care to do it even when it' s embarrasing for people to notice. EOS 6 1 8 [Greeting] That sounds very hard. I can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn' t want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself. What do you do to cope? EOS 6 0 9 stay away from mean people, stop tryiig to explain my symptoms to others who won' t get it. EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That makes sense why you would want to avoid doing these things, which is a good thing, but is there anything that you try to do that isn' t avoidance? Something that approaches something? EOS 6 0 11 I go to all my therapy appoints and try to participate. Thanks for your help. Have a good day. EOS 6 1 12 [Question] How do you feel about therapy?
3 0 0 i am feeling sad. my boyfriend left me out of the blue. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so sorry for hearing that. Do you want to talk more detail about that? EOS 3 0 2 yes, i want to. i am unable to concentrate in anything. i feel so negative about my life. what is the point of this relationship then? EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You seem really focus on just one person. Life is rich. Think about other important people in your life such as parents, friends. EOS 3 0 4 i can understand all of this. may be i need some time. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes of course you should take your time as long as you want and you can do it, one day you can leave all those problem. EOS 3 0 6 hoping the same. want to be the happy person like i was before. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Also do exercise, yoga, workout, talk your friends, listen to music etc sort of things might help you a lot. whatever works for you, you' ll try them out. Just chatting with you, you seem very a smart, strong girl. Do not be upset about things you can' t control. EOS 3 0 8 i think i should divert my concentration on something else. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] For sure, what else we need to talk about? EOS 3 0 10 it really hurts when the person means you the most becomes unavailable out of the blue without stating any reason. nothing. thanks for your support anyways. i am glad talking to you. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I feel the same way. EOS 3 0 12 thank you then. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] Sure, is there anything that I can help you. EOS 3 0 14 none. how are you coping up with the current situation? EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Kinda Ok, but struggling with some issues such as eating unhealthy. EOS 3 0 16 why can' t to cook in your home? is there anyone to help you? EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] not sure, i can cook myself however the situation pushes me unhealthy choice somehow lol. Btw, it helps for your current mood, does not it? I mean we are talking about other stuffs which make you think about your problem less?
5 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. I' m here to listen. EOS 5 0 1 The unemployment office is overwhelmed and I' m overwhelmed trying to help my family member. EOS 5 1 2 [Providing Suggestions or Information] These days all of us have this situation. I can assure you that your family can understand it. How about an online job? EOS 5 0 3 Yes, it just very frustrating. My family member has taken another restaurant job only to lose it again for the same reasons, COVID. They have been going to temp services also. EOS 5 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I also worked in a coffee house and it has been closed for this damn virus. I feel sad too. But we should go on. EOS 5 0 5 The job center' s can only help so much. And if they don' t have internet skills, then online jobs will help. EOS 5 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] This sounds good. EOS 5 0 7 So this family member gave up their apartment, moved back in with family, still fighting unemployment and going to food banks. It' s crazy. They are doing what they can but when we talk about it, it' s hard to believe in these modern times we are in such a mess. EOS 5 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I wish this virus ends soon. But believe me everyone have similar situation these days. Did they try any online job?
6 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there! How may I support you? EOS 6 0 2 Well, I' m really upset with my friends. EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I am so sorry to hear that. Did something happen? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, they aren' t taking COVID seriously. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns? EOS 6 0 6 Yes but they get angry with me. I don' t know how to get through to them, EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It' s also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right. EOS 6 0 8 I really don' t know I just haven' t been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out. It' s a weird dynamic. EOS 6 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you' re finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it' s the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right? EOS 6 0 10 That' s exactly right. EOS 6 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is such a hard position to be in. it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance. EOS 6 0 12 I' d like to think so but I wish they would too. It' s hard to know what is right. EOS 6 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have found that having vitural movie nights, or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected. Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try? EOS 6 0 14 Yes, but they' ll have their BBQs and parties anyway. They are having a group Thanksgiving and there will be a lot of people there. My husband and I feel bad that we aren' t going, but we also know it isn' t smart. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can' t live your life in fear, and that they' re going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware. EOS 6 0 16 We feel like after this is all over, they will still remind us that we were standoffish during this time. And I agree. The longer we put it off and don' t take it seriously, the longer it will last. EOS 6 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Can you tell them that that just isn' t the case? You and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others. If I am correct, it has nothing to do with the fact that you don' t want to see your pals and family! From chatting with you it sounds like your relationships with these people is incredibly important to you. EOS 6 0 18 Yes that' s totally accurate. Yes they are. They are good people. They just think living for the moment is the bigger picture. EOS 6 1 19 [Greeting] I hope your friends can see how important they are to you and thats a huge reason why you' re not seeing them.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 hi. Could you please help?. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] How are you tonight?. EOS 3 0 3 I am okay. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 3 0 5 I caught my gf texting another guy. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So from what I understand, you caught your significant other texting someone else.. EOS 3 0 7 yes right. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] What types of things was she texting him about? EOS 3 0 9 Asking about what he was doing later. What he likes to do for fun. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Just from the few messages we have sent, I can tell you are very anxious and upset about this situation.. EOS 3 0 11 yes for sure, i was so shocked and disappointed. EOS 3 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand this as I had issues with my ex fiancé texting other guys and cheating on me..
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 Hi, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Greeting] Doing good.. How are you?
0 0 0 Hello. My name is Spike. What is yours? Is anyone there? I feel kind of sad and rejected that no one is answering. Is this part of the task? EOS 0 1 1 [Others] oh no i' m sorry i left you waited. please tell me your problem. EOS 0 0 2 I' m trying to make money on MTurk and starting a YouTube channel. Money is a big concern for me. EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] We are on the same boat. Do you have any other jobs? EOS 0 0 4 No. That' s my only income right now. It has led to a real crisis of self confidence to me. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you considered applying for a job or trying uber drive/ eats? EOS 0 0 6 I have. But I have health conditions that would mean Covid - 19 would be very risky for me to get. So, I' m trying to work online. I' m trying to stay encouraged. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand how you feel, it' s tough not being able to work and earn much money. However, you are doing your best right now and should feel proud of yourself. EOS 0 0 8 Thanks. I appreciate that. What do you do to stay encouraged or confident? EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I try to spend more time outdoor and keep myself busy. I like to cook since it' s very relaxing and helps keep my mind concentrated. EOS 0 0 10 cooking for me is just another chore. But getting outside might help. I live out in the country. So I have nice scenery. EOS 0 1 11 [Others] That is perfect then, the nature is very healing. You can also hang out with friends and talk to them about how you feel.
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you. EOS 0 0 6 Thank you for the positive message and believing in me. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer can keep you safe and healthy while grocery shopping. EOS 0 0 8 grocery pick - up, that' s not a bad coping mechanism. I don' t know, I don' t want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus I just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. But that' s just me.. sanitizer I should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Practicing mindfulness and going on a short walk in nature can help with your stress. EOS 0 0 10 yes that would help I suppose, just that I stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started.. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic. You should look into that if you are interested in it. EOS 0 0 12 My life was put on a pause and I still can' t believe it' s november already.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 3 0 1 Hello, I am looking for help in managing some depression. EOS 3 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You' ve come to a good place to start. Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 3 I am feeling resentful towards my husband for quitting his job, and my son for being the reason that he quit his job.. My son' s behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us. EOS 3 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband' s loss of work and your son' s loss of his job is entirely understandable. EOS 3 0 5 I have a hard time not dwelling on the negative things going on. It' s hard to see anything positive or feel hopeful for the future. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and I understand the added stress that can cause in your household. That is a really difficult position to be in. EOS 3 0 7 My son is very defiant and argues with us about everything we try and get him to do, but he expects us to give him money for fun things that he wants to do when he isn' t willing to work or even help out around the house. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Regardless of what your husband' s actions are and your son' s, could you possibly make the time to do things to support yourself, that even momentarily would provide you with some positive feelings? EOS 3 0 9 I try to go for a run every night, that does help.. EOS 3 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard emotionally, so I am sorry you have to deal with your son' s behavior. EOS 3 0 11 It is hard to keep my emotions separate from what is going on with him. EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is very understandable! Setting boundaries for yourself may help. Even when it' s difficult, being clear with your son that you will not be giving him money could help. Sometimes being clear with your own expectations can help him to see what won' t be accepted from him as long as he is living in your home. EOS 3 0 13 Yes, I could do better at that. I want him to have fun and do things with friends, but I want him to be willing to work for what he wants, too.. I do struggle with expectations. I want him to be someone that he is not willing to be, I need to let go of that and just let him be himself and not base my emotions on his choices. EOS 3 1 14 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand that. Especially when it comes to people we are close to, it can be hard to separate our expectations from theirs. EOS 3 0 15 I feel guilty sometimes taking time to do things that I like and that are away from my family. I can see that I need to do that more, though. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I' ve had to learn this lesson many times with my own children. It' s difficult, but ultimately will give you some relief from your resentment. EOS 3 0 17 Thank you, it is helpful to know that other people have felt the same way. EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Absolutely! Being a parent is difficult. Remembering to support yourself helps. Making the time to do things to support your wellbeing doesn' t make you selfish at all. EOS 3 0 19 Thank you! EOS 3 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are certainly not alone. Has any of this been helpful? Is there more I can do for you?
0 0 0 Hi. Hello, can you help me? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I hope so. What kind of problem are you having? EOS 0 0 2 I am really struggling with my studies at the moment, I am so anxious that I keep putting off my essays and worrying all the time. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are a student who is having trouble. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, I am a mature student and struggling with my course. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand how you feel. I was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school. It is very understandable that you are feeling stressed, especially with the pandemic and other issues happening. EOS 0 0 6 yes, the pandemic is making it worse. I am working as well so I am struggling juggling them all and running a house. I just don' t know how to get back on track with my studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about putting together a schedule to help you manage your time? EOS 0 0 8 How would I go about that? EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you go online, there are different templates for students. One would be a time management template where you fill in the blocks of different times of the day. Also, do you know any of your classmates that you could email or text for support? EOS 0 0 10 okay, I can see the sense in that. Have you used them before, if so would you recommend putting everything on there or keeping it flexible? I do have a couple that i could contact, I' ve been feeling really embarrassed to contact them, like they might think I am being silly. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] To start, fill in one week to see what all activities you have to do. Set aside specific time for doing your schoolwork. Try and stick with the schedule.
4 1 0 [Question] Good evening. What would you like to talk about? EOS 4 0 1 evening. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you feeling at the moment? EOS 4 0 3 i lost those books, I cannot even explain, how it happen. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have lost some books? Were they important to you? EOS 4 0 5 I price one of the books, Amazon said 1000. yes. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] So you have lost a book that is worth a thousand dollars? I can imagine you are feeling really bad about that. EOS 4 0 7 where will I g et almost 3 thousand dollars. It is too painful. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I do not know.. have you considered taking an extra job on the side? EOS 4 0 9 yes, i do. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to get help with finding the books? Someone could have handed them in.
4 0 0 I just lost my job and am worried about paying the bills. EOS 4 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills. EOS 4 0 2 There is just too much pressure, but I have to succeed. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is hard having so much pressure but I think you will be able to soon get employed again. EOS 4 0 4 I am trying. I' ve started looking online for new positions but it is a process. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise.
1 1 0 [Question] hi. how can i help you? EOS 1 0 1 hi. i am really angry. EOS 1 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] are you saying that you are angry now? what happened dear? EOS 1 0 3 really angry at my friend. EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] can you tell me what happened so that i can understand? EOS 1 0 5 i told him a secret about my self in private and he played a stupid pranks that reveals it to other people i don' t like. EOS 1 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s ok dear. did you asked him why he did that? EOS 1 0 7 he said he was drunk. EOS 1 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] just remember, yesterday is gone. there is really nothing you can do about the situation. you better keep your distance from that particular person.
6 0 0 hi my friend. EOS 6 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] Hello! How are you doing? EOS 6 0 2 feeling very shame. EOS 6 1 3 [Question] Oh my god! What happened? EOS 6 0 4 i have cheated on my girlfriend. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel sorry for you.. What was the reason behind that? I understand how you are feeling right now. EOS 6 0 6 me and my girlfriend mom had an physical relationship but till now my girlfriend belives im good guy. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Calm down friend. EOS 6 0 8 what should i do now. EOS 6 1 9 [Question] Can i know the reason why you got attracted to her mom when she herself is there? Chill out friend, feel good atleast now you have realised your mistake. Whatever happened has happened, forget everything. EOS 6 0 10 i have gone to her home. her mom taken advantage to me what should i dothat time so we did it. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand, so now forget from beng guilty. EOS 6 0 12 but till now my girlfriend dont know about it but her mom is now targeting me for her sexual desire. EOS 6 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You have got such a nice girlfriend, have a happy life with her. EOS 6 0 14 but think about her mom how could i handle her. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Dont worry, just tell your girlfriend directly about the incident of how her mom is behaving towards you with a proof if you could. Or else be bold enough to warn her mom regarding this. EOS 6 0 16 yes im going to warn her. EOS 6 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] You have such a nice girlfriend my dear friend, so cheating her is not at all fair. Yes, go ahead, the problems will vanish. EOS 6 0 18 yeah i can understand. EOS 6 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] And i believe you too are good, as you have realised your mistake, so stop worrying or feeling guilty for the act. Be happy:)
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you doing? EOS 1 0 1 Hi, I' m ok. How are you? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] Not bad, it' s a peaceful night. Anything in particular you' d like to talk about? EOS 1 0 3 That' s great. My job refused my request to continue to work from home. So I was pretty much forced to go into a school where the cases are growing. EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I imagine that' s very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being? EOS 1 0 5 Just to make sure I' m wearing my mask, washing my hands, and social distancing. Which is not enough. There are more and more teachers getting infected and I just feel it a matter of time before it my turn.. I fear that I will bring this home to my family and I will not survive it. I have pre existing conditions. EOS 1 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry that you' re having to deal with such stressful circumstances. You can only control what you can control. Have you discussed these concerns with the school and explained the preexisting conditions? I get it though. It' s scary for everyone at this point. EOS 1 0 7 Yes I have explained to my principal, my team, and got a note from my Rheumatologist. EOS 1 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems to me that they should take that information into consideration. EOS 1 0 9 I feel that way too. I was told it for the best interest of the school that I am there I do not have student in my classroom but I' m forced to help out around the school with students and staff. Teachers are not cared about its just about pleasing the parents it crazy. I can' t quit because there not much to go into now. EOS 1 1 10 [Question] Is there someone else you could go to about this? Besides whoever you' ve already attempted to discuss it with? Yeah you' re right. Covid has been a mess for everyone and affected us in so many ways that e could' ve never prepared for.
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic! EOS 0 0 4 yeah it' s crazy. I am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime I go out for groceries. I work once or twice a week outside of the home and I generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. I am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. I sympathize fully. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you today? EOS 3 0 1 hi i am okay, a little bit sad though. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Okay. I am very sorry to hear that! Do you want to tell me more about that? EOS 3 0 3 Well with the holidays coming up i have been very stressed and nervous about what i am going to do. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really feel you there. Holidays are so hard.. especially with the way this year has been. Anything specific?. EOS 3 0 5 Yes. I am a college student and I live on campus. The day before I moved in my dad said some unforgivable things to me and we haven' t spoke since. I have no choice but to go live at home over the break but I am very scared about it. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Do you feel scared for your own self? Or of the situation in general? I' m sorry to hear that. Relationships with parents can be very difficult sometimes.. I' m around college age as well and also live at home. So I can understand your struggle. EOS 3 0 7 more for the situation in general. i know we will not speak but we will constantly be running into each other, my house is not big. and i have no car to escape it. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] It' s like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it' s such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you' re not positive in. I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely.. It' ll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets? EOS 3 0 9 Thank you I appreciate that. I will be fine making it over the thanksgiving break but I am more nervous about covid - 19 sending us home for good.. Not many to be honest. I have a hamster but he is at school with me so nothing at home to go back to. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like Covid - 19 is going to be a personal stressor for you. It' s such a strange thing to have to live with already, the pandemic, and i' m sorry that it might end up pushing you where you don' t want to be. Could you bring your hamster home with you? Even the smallest things could help a place feel more loving. EOS 3 0 11 Yes it is very strange and I know that it is a big stressor on all of us, i don' t want to sound selfish.. Yes i am bringing him home with me so that is my little piece of joy that is coming along. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t think you' re selfish at all. You have feelings you are entitled to have and are expressing them which is healthy and I encourage that behavior! Good! I know how hard this situation can be. Very nerve wracking. The smallest things, even a hamster, can be so beneficial.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with this evening?. EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very depressed lately. Like a constant pressure that i don' t know exactly what it is. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I' m very sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 4 0 3 I think the days getting shorter makes it worse. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating. EOS 4 0 5 Do you have any tips on how to overcome it? EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help. I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through Instagram. I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while.. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up. I like to stay up, but when it' s time to get up i dread it. Bad cycle. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sure, that' s understandable. There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin D, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them.. EOS 4 0 9 Time is the fire in which we burn. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] Now that is intractable. EOS 4 0 11 Lol... yes it is. The pandemic heightens all our awareness of time and mortality. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes, to me, the enormity of the universe is calming to my anxiety. Being assured that I mean absolutely nothing is nice sometimes. EOS 4 0 13 And drives the civil unrest which makes me feel anxious and insecure. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] Not in a scary, better - off - dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion. I' m a flea to the universe. EOS 4 0 15 Yes i find that a strangly comforting thought. EOS 4 1 16 [Others] ... then you have to wonder, what are fleas thinking?!. EOS 4 0 17 They have the luxury of instinct without having to" think" at all. EOS 4 1 18 [Others] God, tell me more, lol. EOS 4 0 19 They just be fleas. Fleas gonna flea. EOS 4 1 20 [Others] Galaxies gonna spiral. EOS 4 0 21 I worry too that the U. S. government has no idea what it' s doing. And the people at large are all losing their mental health. EOS 4 1 22 [Reflection of feelings] Yeah they have kicked the can down to local governments, local governments kick the can down to the citizens. It' s absurd. No on wants to take responsibility for taking responsibility.. It' s a very uncertain situation and it' s a psychological reality that when we don' t have physical or metnal security, it' s extremely hard for a human being to progress through stages in life or learn new skill as well or at all. EOS 4 0 23 I guess it' s like you said before, we can only change ourselves. EOS 4 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] So everyone' s plans are canceled for the year, plus no one has any idea when the shit' s going to end, so not unlike a dog at the vet, the suffering seems interminable.. EOS 4 0 25 And focus on our own development. True. Well thanks for your support and kind words, ending chat now. EOS 4 1 26 [Others] Of course, have a great evening!
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state. EOS 0 0 6 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well.
3 0 0 Hello, I' ve been really depressed lately and feel like there isn' t anything I can do to break this feeling. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened? EOS 3 0 2 November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS( its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 4 Yes that is correct. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest. EOS 3 0 6 I know I' m not alone and that' s what makes it hard to reach out, because I don' t want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there' s. It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do. It seems that you don' t want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person. EOS 3 0 8 I just don' t know what to do about it anymore. Yes, I don' t like to bother others or let other people down. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure. Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief? Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think? EOS 3 0 10 It is a lot, I' m used to being the person that everyone comes to for help, but I am not very good at asking for help myself. I have seen a doctor and they started my new medicine regimen but unfortunately there is no cure for this disease. I was going to physical therapy but finished that right as Covid started.. Plus it does get better as the weather gets warmer so the winter has been hard, really looking forward to spring and summer for a little relief. EOS 3 1 11 [Others] I' m sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi my name is Sarah, how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hi, Sarah. I am at my wits end. I feel like I am going crazy. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That sounds stressful. What' s happening? EOS 0 0 3 I am stressed out about having to move and I just can' t seem to calm down when it is time to sleep.. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Moving is such a stressful time. When do you move?. EOS 0 0 5 I am moving in a month, but there is just so much to do before then. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. What is your wind - down routine like in the evening, if you have one? EOS 0 0 7 I usually put my kids to bed and then try to relax for about an hour while I watch tv before I head to bed. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Oh you' re a parent AND you are moving, you have a lot on your plate! EOS 0 0 9 Yes, I am a homeschooling mother of two.. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried a warm bath before bed? that' s helped me before. Meditation to still my mind before sleeping helps too. I' ve read that a small carb snack before bed, like a peice of toast, is supposed to help us fall asleep, I haven' t tried it though. EOS 0 0 11 A bath does sound really relaxing. I have tried some meditations. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One thing I highly recommend is a podcast called" Tracks to Relax". EOS 0 0 13 Thanks, I will have to try that. Music does tend to calm me down. I don' t know why I haven' t tried that. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It' s guided sleep meditations, and his voice is incredibly soothing.... works well for me on nights I can' t naturally fall asleep. He leads you relaxing walks into the forest and such things, it' s very peaceful. EOS 0 0 15 I really appreciate that help, I will try it for sure. I think it will be easier to focus on a meditation with someone talking me through it. EOS 0 1 16 [Question] Have you a partner sharing the childrearing? EOS 0 0 17 Yes, but he has already moved to our new house because he is working on floors and stuff to get it ready. So I have been alone to stew in my worries. EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see so right now you' re the main" parent - er"? Do you have other family that could take the kids for a wekend so you can have a proper rest?
4 1 0 [Question] Good evening. What would you like to talk about? EOS 4 0 1 evening. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you feeling at the moment? EOS 4 0 3 i lost those books, I cannot even explain, how it happen. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have lost some books? Were they important to you? EOS 4 0 5 I price one of the books, Amazon said 1000. yes. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] So you have lost a book that is worth a thousand dollars? I can imagine you are feeling really bad about that. EOS 4 0 7 where will I g et almost 3 thousand dollars. It is too painful. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I do not know.. have you considered taking an extra job on the side? EOS 4 0 9 yes, i do. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to get help with finding the books? Someone could have handed them in. EOS 4 0 11 school, should just give me enough time to find the books. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you have any idea of where you lost them?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 2 Feeling depressed as usual. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed?
1 0 0 im very upset. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry. Would you like to tell me about it? EOS 1 0 2 yes. i invited my friend over to watch my new puppy while i painted my room because my dog has seperation anxiety and can' t be alone. then she showed up with her new boyfriend. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] What bothered you about that? EOS 1 0 4 well i dont know him and my stuff was all out in the living room where he was alone for most of the day. i actually didnt suspect anything would happen at first. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can see why that would upset you though. Did something happen? EOS 1 0 6 yes, after they left, i started putting my stuff back in my room and realized the purse i keep my nintendo switch in was GONE. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m so sorry that happened to you. I would be very upset as well. EOS 1 0 8 i' ve known her for 8 years. but this guy is very new. they' re not even officially together. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Did you speak to your friend about it? EOS 1 0 10 yes, so i called her and asked her if she saw my bag and she got defensive. she started talking about how much money he has and how he doesnt have to steal. EOS 1 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It is sometimes hard for people to believe someone they care about could do something bad. EOS 1 0 12 but she should care about me more!! she barely knows him. EOS 1 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have been in a similar situation with a friend and her husband; when he was exhibiiing bad behavior, she did not want to see it in him. I agree that she should value you your friendship more than someone she just met. EOS 1 0 14 last time we went out for brunch, he literally tried to make her pay for it! that' s not the behavior of someone that has money like she claims. she' s delusional. EOS 1 1 15 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are worried about your friend putting her trust into this guy. EOS 1 0 16 im worried about how i' m going to get my switch back. i dont have money for a new one. im thinking of calling the cops. EOS 1 1 17 [Others] I think if you talk to her again and tell her you are looking out for her best interests it may help open a conversation. If you do end up calling the cops, at least you will have tried to speak with her first. EOS 1 0 18 i should tell her that i am thinking about calling the cops, at least. or maybe not cuz she might tell him. then he can get rid of it. i think she is working with him, maybe, or at least covering for him. EOS 1 1 19 [Question] Knowing your friend, do you really think she would do that? EOS 1 0 20 i think she would cover him, maybe, or try to avoid the truth. but no i dont think she would plot with him. EOS 1 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you really care about your friend, and want the best for her. She may not realize this but you are doing the right thing.
3 1 0 [Question] hi there? EOS 3 0 1 Hi. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] how are you? what' s new with you? EOS 3 0 3 I am not doing so great. I fell down some stairs the other day and broke my foot and chipped my two front teeth. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that. I feel you because I had an experience about breaking my bones. It was sad story. how you feel right now. EOS 3 0 5 I am grateful for my family they are taking care of me but I am on crutches and am in a boot when I am not icing my foot. EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Very good. I am glad that you have a good family who can support you whenever you need a help. EOS 3 0 7 Yes I am struggling with some depression just because I am feeling a bit isolated with the broken foot along with COVID going on. EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Totally, sad side of our current situation. I hope you can tide - over this hard time soon and you are doing your best at this time. So proud! EOS 3 0 9 Thank you I appreciate that! Yes I am getting surgery like 2 days before christmas so this christmas should definitely be interesting to say the least haha. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ohhh that sucks. I am happy to yo don' t lose your fun and you are not pessimist which is good and it might help for your health. Always try to see the bright side. EOS 3 0 11 Yes exactly. I got my teeth fixed a couple days ago as well so that was good too! I am really leaning on my family for support but just felt like asking for some outside help which is why I am talking to you right now lol. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Exactly, sometimes we need new window to see things by different ankle. So can I ask you what you want me to do or what is really need you right now? EOS 3 0 13 I think I pretty much got everything I need from you - I just needed to vent I think. So we can stop talking now or whenever you have to leave. EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] ok for sure, It was nice to talk you.
3 0 0 I was reallly worried in this suitation. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi, i' m sean, hows your day going. EOS 3 0 2 Was not so good. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Tell me about the situation.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, my name is Rose, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi Rose. I' m ok, but I get embarrassed about my curly hair. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What about your hair is embarrasing exactly? Curls seem like a lovely thing to have( mine is dead straight, lets trade lol) But no, seriously, what in particular don' t you like about it? i admire people who have natural curls. EOS 4 0 3 They are unruly and not the pretty kind of curls. Often get frizzy by the end of the day. It get' s frustrating when I always look a mess. EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh I could see that being frustrating, if you can' t keep them neat. is your hair short or long? EOS 4 0 5 It is long. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you thought of having it shorter, it might be easier to tame? Just a thought.... you say you always look like a mess... is that your personal opinion or has anyone else commented on your hair? EOS 4 0 7 I started to cut it shorter last time, but my stylist said it would be big. It is hard to find the right product.. It is my personal opinion.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you asked a friend for an honest opinion? EOS 4 0 9 My friend likes my hair, but also says she can see that it is hard to manage. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance.. EOS 4 0 11 I can totally relate to that. I think we always want what we dont have. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One thing I have started doing, since my hair hasn' t been cut for a year due to pandemic, is wearing hats. my hair is driving me crazy, so I get your frustration. Is it long enough to braid? EOS 4 0 13 I went a year without cutting mine as well for the same reason. That is probably why it felt so out of control now that you say that. Now that I am vaccinated I just got it cut. Maybe I will like it better now. Yes, I do like braids. That is a good idea. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] yay! a haircut!!! Congrats. EOS 4 0 15 Thank you. It does make it feel a little better. I hope you can get yours cut soon too. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] one last suggestion: ask more stylists' opinions perhaps? oh thankyou.... had my shot yesterday.... now I have to wait for our lockdown to expire( May 20) so I have a bit more shag to go. EOS 4 0 17 Yes, good idea. It seems it has been so long to be able to do this. Maybe I need to think of a new style. Had my second shot last Thursday so I hope opportunities like a new stylist happen soon. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you googled images for short curly hairstyles? EOS 4 0 19 I will look on Pinterest. Good idea. EOS 4 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Second shot congrats!! Very exciting. Pinterest is a great source for hairstyles as I recall... there are boards and boards of them. Good idea! EOS 4 0 21 Thank you. I can' t believe how relieved I feel knowing I' ve had it. Sick for a couple days but worth it. Now I will feel like looking at pinterest more. Maybe you are right and I need something new and fresh. EOS 4 1 22 [Question] which vaccine did you get?
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 6 0 1 hi. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing? EOS 6 0 3 Well I' m distraught. EOS 6 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel that way? EOS 6 0 5 Because my girlfriend has left me. EOS 6 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard for you. I haven' t personally had to deal with that, but I have had friends that have. How long were you together? EOS 6 0 7 four years. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being together that long must have made that break up difficult. How are you coping with it? EOS 6 0 9 well I' m not really, especially as she' d gone off with someone else. But I' m to blame which makes it worse. EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened? EOS 6 0 11 I cheated on her on a drunken night. It was a one - off and I regret it terribly. But she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain. EOS 6 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I see how she would be upset. It must be difficult for you though because she didn' t give you another chance. Do you have someone to talk to about your feelings? EOS 6 0 13 yeah, I' m not saying I deserved it just wish she had. But no, not really. No - one who would understand. EOS 6 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I would have wanted a second chance too if I were in your shoes. Is this affecting you really bad? EOS 6 0 15 Yeah I feel so low. EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If your mood is affecting your daily activities, normally that means your mental health has been affected. You could always talk to a professional if it' s hard for you. EOS 6 0 17 it' s difficult though, to open up. EOS 6 1 18 [Self-disclosure] It is. But trust me, it really helps. I' ve been seeing a therapist recently actually and I love it. I don' t have to worry about judgement at all. It' s a hard step but worth it in the end. EOS 6 0 19 They won' t think I' m to blame? EOS 6 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The job of the therapist isn' t to figure out if what you did was wrong or right. It' s to help you understand your feelings and better cope. That' s why they are so great! EOS 6 0 21 oh yeah, that' s a good point. EOS 6 1 22 [Question] Would you like to talk anything else through? EOS 6 0 23 No you' ve been helpful thanks. EOS 6 1 24 [Greeting] no problem! I hope that everything works out for you. EOS 6 0 25 thanks x. EOS 6 1 26 [Others] I think you' re supposed to end the conversation btw. Have a great day!

I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. He will not admit it himself. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. He says the person who told me is lying. We are not married but we live together.

If he says no, then ask him why. EOS 3 0 18 That is a good point.. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people.

So I went to McDonald' s and pick up the order and took it to the right address and after a few hours I notice that the client did not confirm the order. EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am not knowledgeable in this service industry. Let me understand. You delivered the order, but the customer did not confirm they wanted it.. EOS 1 0 6 Five minutes later my supervisor called me saying that the client call and reported that he did not received his order. And that' s not true at all, I gave him the food. So now i don' t know if they going to fired me or let me keep the job. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation?

We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Sure, I understand. EOS 3 0 22 I should trust my partner more than any random person. EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello. How can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 What should I do. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Tell me about the situation that you are facing. EOS 0 0 3 I try to find a job but there is not many. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking? EOS 0 0 5 About 6 months. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that there are a lot of job loss in the Covid time. Is your job seeking related to that? Yeah it must be very difficult. EOS 0 0 7 yes. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and I got an offer in February right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you. I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family. EOS 0 0 9 I don' t know what types of jobs that fit me. yeah, but it is still rough to get by. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] Tell me more about it if you don' t mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking? EOS 0 0 11 I worked in manufacturer. technical skill in trade school but not degree from college. EOS 0 1 12 [Others] I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position? EOS 0 0 13 I will seek for another jobs if possible but I can work on manufacturer company too. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the Covid time?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi! What' s on your mind tonight?. EOS 4 0 1 I think a friend I' ve known for 30 years since college has drifted away from me. Even during the pandemic she has made new friends. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, I' m sorry, that' s not fun at all, especially since you two have been friends for so long. Have you tried reaching out to her by phone, email or social media?. EOS 4 0 3 She has cut our conversations short by saying she is tried. She will return text but I feel like I am always initiating. She likes watching tv show and told me with her NEW friend they Facetime and watch TV together. I really hate watching TV so don' t want to offer to participate. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, it' s a positive sign that she hasn' t blocked you completely. I agree, texting her each day could irritate her. That' s okay! You shouldn' t do anything that isn' t fun or enjoyable or comfortable for either of you, in my opinion. EOS 4 0 5 I am jealous that she is more successful in making new friends. I have not made a new friend in over 10 years. EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life.
0 0 0 I have anxiety about what avenue to take academically. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello! Don' t worry, I am here to help. So you are saying that you are not sure what career to study? EOS 0 0 2 I do have an idea about it but I am anxious about choosing wrong and boxing myself into something I wish I hadn' t chosen. EOS 0 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Even if you chose wrong, you will generally have plenty of time to make up your mind and choose something that you really like:), plus, you can reach out to academic advisors, for example. EOS 0 0 4 I suppose you' re right, I think I don' t have confidence in myself that what ever I do choose, I will be good at it. Good enough to make a life out of it. fear of failing myself because i lose interest in things over time. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently.

EOS 3 1 23 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters. EOS 3 0 24 But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? EOS 3 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work. If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you.... even after work. EOS 3 0 26 okay! that is a good idea. Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. EOS 3 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. EOS 3 0 28 That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. EOS 3 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you? EOS 3 0 30 Okay. I will keep that in mind. We are 22. EOS 3 1 31 [Question] Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? EOS 3 0 32 Yes but less over the past few months. EOS 3 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related.... for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. EOS 3 0 34 That' s understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. EOS 3 1 35 [Providing Suggestions or Information] How do you all generally communicate? Through text? EOS 3 0 36 He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends.. EOS 3 1 37 [Question] Which do you and your man like to communicate? EOS 3 0 38 No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something. EOS 3 1 39 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot. EOS 3 0 40 You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help.. EOS 3 1 41 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you. EOS 3 0 42 Do you think getting other people involved is a good idea? EOS 3 1 43 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would be subtle about that tactic.. If you haven' t met any of his school mates. I wouldn' t pursue that option. Have you met any of his class mates? EOS 3 0 44 Yeah he has a few close friends but he is pretty to himself. We both live far away from home. EOS 3 1 45 [Question] Are you and him directly off campuses in housing? You both attend the same college, correct? EOS 3 0 46 Yes off campus. Same college. EOS 3 1 47 [Question] Where do you work? Have you seen the customer who said that your partner was cheating? Seen the customer before? Was it a man or woman who dropped the shocking news? I feel that the customer may have a case of mistaken identity indeed. EOS 3 0 48 I work at a bar part time to support may way through school. It was a women. I know her, but not well. Met a few times around school. EOS 3 1 49 [Reflection of feelings] Sounds like drunk slander talk. I would let things go for awhile and follow up later.
3 0 0 Hello, I need some help with this. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I' m here to help you. EOS 3 0 2 What should I do about my break up? EOS 3 1 3 [Question] When it was happened. EOS 3 0 4 It happened yesterday. She broke up with me. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh.. It' s really sad. But don' t worry. You can explain feelings to her. She may change her mind.
0 0 0 hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hi. How' s it goin'? Are you feeling troubled about something this morning? I know it can be hard to talk about personal problems sometimes. I have a lot of trouble with that myself. EOS 0 0 2 going smooth, i need to get a nice and a surprise able present for my parent, and at the same time I need to pay my house bills. my father understands the situation that my earning is not that much, but my mum will fuck complain that I am taking care of my wife but not her. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you' re having some cash flow issues, right? I can relate to that at a few more points in my life than I' d points in my life than I' d like to recall. It' s so very loving and sweet of you to be putting so much thought into the gift! That isn' t all that common anymore, unfortunately.. Are you currently working? EOS 0 0 4 yes, your are right, I cannot stay in house without paying bills. yes, I am working but the income is not that much. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It is pretty ridiculous how income doesn' t increase along with inflation/ cost of living. Very illogical and crippling to many of us financially. Of course you' ll need to put your rent and utilities above all else, and since the gift you are feeling stressed out about is a parental gift,
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed! EOS 7 0 7 And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that' s one method I have used.. Thank you for your trust in me.. EOS 7 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don' t overdo it.. EOS 7 0 9 I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible. true, very true.. Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen? EOS 7 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you. EOS 7 0 11 Thanks for sympathizing and understanding.. EOS 7 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello. EOS 2 0 1 Hello I am in need of assistance. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] I am Tom. How can I help you? How are you in need of assistance? EOS 2 0 3 Hello Tom, this is Dillon.. I haven' t been doing well in my academics. EOS 2 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I have a real talent to provide guidance to people out there in the World. Not doing well in college or high school? Are you in a trade school? Or in academia? EOS 2 0 5 In college. I started off really well until the pandemic hit. Now my family is struggling financially and it has greatly affected my academics. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Well, I went through a similar situation when a pink - eye breakout hurt my school.... I struggled financially, but took any job I could..... EOS 2 0 7 What kind of jobs did you take? EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Work part - time and go to school part - time. EOS 2 0 9 I' m trying to find a steady job. jobs that can help support both my family and my tuition. EOS 2 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest creating flyers and ask to be a dog walker. Americans love their dogs. 70 Percent of Americans have dogs. EOS 2 0 11 oh okay that' s interesting. there' s a part time job at a local library should I take it? EOS 2 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I feel that you can be great and be a good entrepreneur..... dog walking doesn' t take a lot of talent.

EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps on the interviews you are doing something wrong, because it have been a while. EOS 3 0 12 i feel that i am not worthy and that no one thinks i am capable. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Dont think that. You are worthy, you just need to apply yourself in the right direction:) EOS 3 0 14 how can i do this. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps look for any job for now, even if they wage isn' t good, because you have to start with something. You need some work experience. EOS 3 0 16 i get depressed when i am rejected every time. EOS 3 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it happens that you get rejected, but it is the opportunity to learn from your mistakes and go again:)
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello. I need some help. I have been depressed. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you doing today? Do have anything on your mind? Oh i see, well we can talk about that if you like. Has anything happened recently to make you feel this way? EOS 4 0 3 I am not doing very well. Very depressed with having to stay home because of the COVID - 19/ I will appreciate anything you can do to help me. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like social isolation is really weighing on you... EOS 4 0 5 Yes, it sure is. I feel so alone. I feel it will help to talk to an outsider. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Human being are social creatures by nature so please understand that the feelings that you are having are absolutely normal. So dont judge yourself or feel as if something is wrong with YOU. EOS 4 0 7 Sometimes it helps to a stranger - most of my friends feel as I do. I am sure you are right - I thank you for your support.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You mentioned your friends feel the same way you do... Have you guys thought about making trying to do a zoom party? EOS 4 0 9 No, we haven' t talked about that, but that is a great idea. I will talk to them to see how they feel about doing this. Thank you. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have a group of sister friends and we threw a zoom party. we scheduled it out and we decorated our own spaces and we made a spotify playlist that everyone contributed a song to and basically just had a video party. Do you think your frinds may like to try that with you? EOS 4 0 11 I feel somewhat better just thin. I feel a little better now. I look forward to talking with my friends about doing Zoom. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Be creative! Get silly! most important have fun! this is a hard year but its still a chance to make happy memories. Is there anything else on your mind? EOS 4 0 13 I will.

6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 2 I have been better. I had a rough semester in school.. EOS 6 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So things haven' t been going well at school. I think a lot of people are going through these days. EOS 6 0 4 It was alright at first but I failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade. EOS 6 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m sorry to hear that. That' s a heck of a situation to be in. Is there anything you can do? Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock? EOS 6 0 6 Yes, I already tried to appeal my grade. EOS 6 1 7 [Question] And the teacher wouldn' t budge? EOS 6 0 8 Sadly, no. I think they were too busy to really take a long time to discuss it or work with me. EOS 6 1 9 [Question] Was this for a course that was required for a major? EOS 6 0 10 It was a core class and I needed it to graduate. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ok, if you' re willing to give it one more shot, try to appeal the grade one more time. If that doesn' t work, you could try talking the class again next semester or during the summer if it' s offered. EOS 6 0 12 That does sound like a good idea. I am just so disappointed I' m not sure if it is worth it. EOS 6 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I know what you mean. I failed a Calc class once and I felt so empty inside. But I pulled myself together to take it again and passed it. I think you can do it too. EOS 6 0 14 I think you' re right. The class is tough and I know I can do it if I put my mind to it. EOS 6 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Exactly! You' ve got what it takes to make it through the difficulty, and your experiences so far will help you. EOS 6 0 16 It is very intimidating but again I agree with you. Thanks for your input. EOS 6 1 17 [Greeting] You' re welcome. In the meantime, have a little relaxation time to ease your mind. Thinking too much about the class would be stressful. EOS 6 0 18 True! I can definitely use the time off before I go back to clear my mind. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I hear relaxing music and funny movies can do the trick.
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Same old.. still trying to lose weight. Already on day 20 for fasting. did not lose a single pound. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight. What kind of methods have you been using? EOS 0 0 4 I tried keto diet for 6 months, didn' t work. So now on Fasting. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are really discouraged. EOS 0 0 6 I also go to gym 2 times a week. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow! You have been trying practically everything. You are really motivated. EOS 0 0 8 Yea, very discouraged... EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Losing weight can be difficult. I' ve struggled with that many times. Have you thought of consulting a dietician or a nutritionist to help? Maybe, they would offer some new suggestions. EOS 0 0 10 I am already lucky that I can sometime able to book swimming pool close by. I considered but they said I am not overweight. EOS 0 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like they didn' t listen to your needs. And it seems like you are doing a great job exercising at the pool and employing other methods to lose weight. What is your primary motivation behind your weight loss goal? EOS 0 0 12 The added weight is putting pressure on my hips and knees.. Causing a lot of pain as well for my lower back. EOS 0 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] That' s no good. I' ll bet that is difficult to deal with. Have you thought about teaming up with a friend and going on daily walks? EOS 0 0 14 No, I have to look after the kids.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, you could also take the kids on a walk every day. That would be a healthy activity to enjoy together, and it should help burn some of their energy too. EOS 0 0 16 I signed them up for swimming classes so they can exercise too. Thanks for your suggestion though. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s great! Now you can all go swimming together. Maybe that can be an activity that you all do together a couple times a week.
4 0 0 I am so embarassed and saddened. I can not believe he cheated on me. I thought we were going to work out. I was really attracted into him and I cared for him a lot. I wanted to date him longer. Thank Goodness I did not sleep with him. What a disaster. Why are men like this? Why do they break women' s hearts? I wish there were more decent men out there that did not play around. Men can be such pigs! EOS 4 1 1 [Question] what happened? EOS 4 0 2 I met a handsome intelligent man. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how are you feeling lately? EOS 4 0 4 We dated for a month. Then out of nowhere he cheated on me. I' m so sad. I am just trying to understand what I did wrong. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s okay. we should learn from things like this. EOS 4 0 6 That' s true. It' s crazy we have to experience heart ache. To learn... EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] don' t think much and keep yourself engaged in the activities you like the most.
3 0 0 I am so stressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi, what' s going on? EOS 3 0 2 I have a college course in the evening, but I cannot concentrate while distance learning. I am expected to watch the instructor do excel on a tiny phone screen and follow along. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oooff that sounds brutal... especially the excel part! do you have a bigger screen you can use?
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave? EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad. EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more. I feel that everyone must know that I' ve been dumped and be laughing at me. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay just anxious. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that' s bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I believe i am going to fail all my finals for college. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] College finals are a stressful time for sure, I' m sure you' re doing your best to prepare. EOS 0 0 6 Yes i have been studying for hours everyday. sometimes it is hard to focus. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s best to take a short break to reset when you feel like your gears are grinding. EOS 0 0 8 that is true, but i feel guilty when i take breaks. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I often feel the same way when I' m not busy doing work. But sometimes you need that little break to get back into the zone and be more productive. EOS 0 0 10 I try to take multiple 5 min breaks throughout my studying but it usually turns into hours breaks lol. its hard to focus. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You sounds pretty stressed about it, make sure you' re getting enough sleep so you don' t get run down. EOS 0 0 12 Yes i. do sleep for at least 10 hours. i also take 20 minute power naps because i have read somewhere it helps. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there someone you could study with to help break up how you' re studying? EOS 0 0 14 yes i live with a roommate and we are in the same program, but i sometimes feel dumb when i study with her. EOS 0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Try not to think of yourself that way. I' m sure you both provide a benefit to each other while studying. EOS 0 0 16 it is fun when we study together,. i also forget to eat sometimes because im so stressed. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I also felt that way around finals and with friends, I think it' s important to recognize this is one semester and that it' s equally as important to take care of yourself as it is to pass those finals. EOS 0 0 18 Yes thats the only thing that is keeping me going. This is only for a few days and it will soon end and i will have a break. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It will get better, this is just now and there' s a lot to look forward once you' re through this. Make sure you' re taking care of yourself first and foremost. That will ultimately provide you success.

EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try meditation as it is able to help you relax and assess your situation. EOS 3 0 20 how many times should i do this. EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe every day or a few times a week, depending on what you feel is necessary.
4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 tired. and u? EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like an exhausting time for a lot of people right now. I' m also a bit tired but doing OK. What' s been on your mind recently? EOS 4 0 3 just trying to finish this semester. EOS 4 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like a stressful time to be in college. How have you been coping with everything going on? EOS 4 0 5 listening to music. EOS 4 1 6 [Others] Nice! What kind of music do you like?
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 3 0 1 Hello. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 3 0 3 Yes, i feel like i am in depsression. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed?? EOS 3 0 5 My partner broke up with me impromptu. EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now. EOS 3 0 7 Exactly, that is my current situation. I feel like my entire life has been rearranged. How did you deal with them and specifically what was your coping mechanism? EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days. I slowly realised that i had put myself in slow motion and then slowly started to do things i used to do to maybe come out of it. EOS 3 0 9 True, what ways would you suggest i use to approach my situation and get out of this state? It is very pathetic really when you think of it, halting all your life activities and plans just because a relationship ended. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well i had a close friend that i was able to vent to and help me see what was important. Do you have anyone close in your life you could talk to for guidance? EOS 3 0 11 Close friends can really be helpful in such situations. Yes, i do have a close friend even though i am very poor when it comes to opening up. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I see what you mean about pathetic lol. But rather than see yourself as pathetic in a negative, use that defiance to push yourself back out into the world. Start slowly with opening up, maybe even tell your friend you intent and ask them to be patient as you learn to better express your inner feelings. EOS 3 0 13 Yes, i should do that because at the end of it all i still have myself to take care of. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think youre already on the right track. I just know you can get back to you! EOS 3 0 15 Opening up is a skill that i could do better at because i have never been the open type. But with a little practice i could get better at it. I have to get better no matter what. Are there other tactics you can share with me with regards to my current situation? EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are resources online that perhaps you could look into to help with expressing yourself. EOS 3 0 17 Is there any particular resource you can refer me to? EOS 3 1 18 [Others] Yes just a moment. EOS 3 0 19 Waiting, thank you. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I was going to send you a few links but it wont let me. EOS 3 0 21 Ooh too bad. Could you just name a few then i can look them up on my own later? EOS 3 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] instead try googling the phrase" how to open up to others" and there should be a few sites with tips and references.
4 1 0 [Question] Good evening. What would you like to talk about? EOS 4 0 1 evening. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you feeling at the moment? EOS 4 0 3 i lost those books, I cannot even explain, how it happen. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have lost some books? Were they important to you? EOS 4 0 5 I price one of the books, Amazon said 1000. yes. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] So you have lost a book that is worth a thousand dollars? I can imagine you are feeling really bad about that. EOS 4 0 7 where will I g et almost 3 thousand dollars. It is too painful. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I do not know.. have you considered taking an extra job on the side? EOS 4 0 9 yes, i do. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to get help with finding the books? Someone could have handed them in. EOS 4 0 11 school, should just give me enough time to find the books. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you have any idea of where you lost them? EOS 4 0 13 allow me to clear myself later, it is a fucking thing. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] I am sorry, I do not understand what you mean. EOS 4 0 15 I am trying to find that out, I packed them inside one bag, may be someone carried the bag or I misplace them. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Try not to worry, it is entirely possible that someone has found them and handed them in to the authorities. You might still get them back! EOS 4 0 17 i need enough time to look for the books, but school is not ready to listen to me. EOS 4 1 18 [Question] That is really not fair of them. Is there a higher authority you can take your case to? EOS 4 0 19 you are right. EOS 4 1 20 [Self-disclosure] They really should be doing more to help you. I know how frustrating it feels to lose something valuable. I did lose a really expensive ring one time but I got it back a week later. EOS 4 0 21 yes, it is fuck giving me headache. EOS 4 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand why it would be! Please try not to worry, all is not lost. EOS 4 0 23 I just need time, I will check the CCTV of my room, and check around. EOS 4 1 24 [Greeting] That is a good idea. I hope that they have not been deliberately stolen.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with this evening?. EOS 4 0 1 I am feeling very depressed lately. Like a constant pressure that i don' t know exactly what it is. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Depression is extremely rough to deal with, I' m very sorry to hear you' re going through that.. EOS 4 0 3 I think the days getting shorter makes it worse. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh yes, less light during the day makes the days seem compacted and suffocating. EOS 4 0 5 Do you have any tips on how to overcome it? EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help. I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through Instagram. I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while.. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up. I like to stay up, but when it' s time to get up i dread it. Bad cycle. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sure, that' s understandable. There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin D, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them.. EOS 4 0 9 Time is the fire in which we burn. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] Now that is intractable. EOS 4 0 11 Lol... yes it is. The pandemic heightens all our awareness of time and mortality. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes, to me, the enormity of the universe is calming to my anxiety. Being assured that I mean absolutely nothing is nice sometimes.
1 0 0 My friend borrowed money from me but she won' t return it now. EOS 1 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry about that. It is always hard when we trust someone and they let us down. is that waht you are feeling? Disappointment in your friend? EOS 1 0 2 Yes, i am very dissapointed because i trusted her completely. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand. I have been through a similar situation. Was it a large amount of money?
0 0 0 I am really feeling the loneliness of the season and being isolated. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Good evening. EOS 0 0 2 Good evening. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just so I understand, the holiday season is making you feel alone and isolated. EOS 0 0 4 Yes as well as the virus. Are we out of time. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Is there anything in particular about the holidays that is bothering you? EOS 0 0 6 Just no family around. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I am also far away from my family for the holidays, so I know how hard that is. EOS 0 0 8 The virus this year does not help. EOS 0 1 9 [Others] Not at all. EOS 0 0 10 ARe you affected by the virus. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about setting up some video calls with your family during the holidays? I know a lot of people are doing that so they can feel closer to the family during these tough times/ I have not been able to travel as much due to the virus. EOS 0 0 12 I thought about he videos but my daughter lives in California. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is tough, but I definitely think setting up a time to chat with her would help a lot! EOS 0 0 14 I have to arrange with her because she does not I am moving. It will bother her. EOS 0 1 15 [Reflection of feelings] I can through our messages that this is a very tough season for you.
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you today? EOS 3 0 1 hi i am okay, a little bit sad though. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Okay. I am very sorry to hear that! Do you want to tell me more about that? EOS 3 0 3 Well with the holidays coming up i have been very stressed and nervous about what i am going to do. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I really feel you there. Holidays are so hard.. especially with the way this year has been. Anything specific?. EOS 3 0 5 Yes. I am a college student and I live on campus. The day before I moved in my dad said some unforgivable things to me and we haven' t spoke since. I have no choice but to go live at home over the break but I am very scared about it. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Do you feel scared for your own self? Or of the situation in general? I' m sorry to hear that. Relationships with parents can be very difficult sometimes.. I' m around college age as well and also live at home. So I can understand your struggle. EOS 3 0 7 more for the situation in general. i know we will not speak but we will constantly be running into each other, my house is not big. and i have no car to escape it. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] It' s like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it' s such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you' re not positive in. I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely.. It' ll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets? EOS 3 0 9 Thank you I appreciate that. I will be fine making it over the thanksgiving break but I am more nervous about covid - 19 sending us home for good.. Not many to be honest. I have a hamster but he is at school with me so nothing at home to go back to. EOS 3 1 10 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like Covid - 19 is going to be a personal stressor for you. It' s such a strange thing to have to live with already, the pandemic, and i' m sorry that it might end up pushing you where you don' t want to be. Could you bring your hamster home with you? Even the smallest things could help a place feel more loving. EOS 3 0 11 Yes it is very strange and I know that it is a big stressor on all of us, i don' t want to sound selfish.. Yes i am bringing him home with me so that is my little piece of joy that is coming along. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I don' t think you' re selfish at all. You have feelings you are entitled to have and are expressing them which is healthy and I encourage that behavior! Good! I know how hard this situation can be. Very nerve wracking. The smallest things, even a hamster, can be so beneficial. EOS 3 0 13 Well thank you that does help me to feel better. Yes I am happy to bring him home with me and hoping I can have my niece over to intro duce her to him. EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] You sound like a very determined person in making this trip as stress free as possible. I commend you for that! Maybe you could have your niece over often to play with your hamster just to soften the stress of being there. EOS 3 0 15 It is surely my goal! I appreciate your kind words. I would love that if I had a car I could do that but I am not sure how much she will be able to come to my house. I am going to try though! EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is Uber an option for you? I know there' s a lot of rideshare services but they' re not always financially reasonable. But that could be a way to get away if you ever need too!
4 1 0 [Question] hi how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Not good, i am very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i' m sorry. whats making you sad? EOS 4 0 3 My friend just stopped talking to me and she won' t tell me the reason why. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] has she communicated via text or messanger? or has all communication stopped? EOS 4 0 5 She stopped communicating completely. Doesn' t even reply to me texts. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] i' m so sorry to hear that. i had a friend do that to me right after the spring pandemic lockdown. did this happen recently? EOS 4 0 7 Yes, just this past week. How did you deal with your situation? EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] i was upset, but then after thinking about it more, i figured she just was overwhelmed with everything going on. i gave her the benefit of the doubt and texted happy birthday this summer and didn' t hear anything back. can you think of anything going on with her that might cause her to stop communicating? EOS 4 0 9 That' s too bad. I suppose that one should be able to let the other person know when you no; longer want to be friends with them. That way one can move on quickly. I am completely unaware. We haven' t had any argument of late so i am completely clueless. Wish she would just reach out. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] i can imagine it' s hard to put those feeling into words when you want to move on.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Not so great - found out i' m losing my job in january. EOS 2 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] On no I am sorry to hear that! I know that must be tough. EOS 2 0 3 Yes I' m not even sure what steps to take right now. EOS 2 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea that can be difficult. Have you started looking for something else? EOS 2 0 5 Not yet, I' m not even sure where to begin. I have not looked for a job in 20 years. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way. EOS 2 0 7 I' ve tried calling the unemployment office to get some ideas but they do not answer their phones. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Or you could look for some side jobs like cleaning or organizing things until you find something more permanent. EOS 2 0 9 Yeah, i' m kinda old for that - LOL!!! My back would not hold up to that - and my salary wouldn' t be comparable. EOS 2 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea it seems to be hard to get up with a lot of places at this time. Persistent is the key. EOS 2 0 11 Well I hear that their offices are closed and you have to do everything online - so not sure if they can even help me. EOS 2 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes i understand right now is a very bad time to find anything with so many places closed. Do you have any family or friends to reach out to for help if needed? EOS 2 0 13 I think I might be able to call my friend, but she' s in another state. EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you gave any thought to babysitting or are there any crafts you are good at making that maybe you could try to sell? EOS 2 0 15 That would not be enough money. I would not be able to pay my bills. EOS 2 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand your concern there but it could help pay some as to help you not to get to far behind until you find something. EOS 2 0 17 that' s true but i don' t want to lose my house either. EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] If i were you i would call your friend maybe she has some suggestions of things you could do based off of your skills. EOS 2 0 19 she may be able to help - she could at least send me in the right direction of where to look and maybe how to freshen up my resume. EOS 2 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] Yea and if not it wont have hurt to talk to her about it and all of the worry off your mind. EOS 2 0 21 that is true - i just hate to bother her, she' s got so much on her plate already. EOS 2 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It does not hurt to try. Maybe call her and tell her you have some things on your mind and could use some advice from her if it is not to much of a bother..
3 0 0 Hello, is someone there? EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, my name is Jonathan. May I ask who I am speaking to today? EOS 3 0 2 Hi Jonathan, I' m Keri. EOS 3 1 3 [Greeting] Hi Keri. How are you today? EOS 3 0 4 I' m feeling a little bit down today. I' ve been feeling a little bit down a lot lately. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh no. I' m sorry to hear that. What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately? EOS 3 0 6 My ex - husband is moved in with his new girlfriend. They might get married. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh Keri, that must feel awful. Was it a recent separation between you two? EOS 3 0 8 He started dating a few months after we split up. I don' t know if this is the only person he' s dated but I think so. He really moved on quick. Hi, are you still there? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Yeah I understand what you' re going through. I was in a similar position not too long ago. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. How does it make you feel that he' s trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours? EOS 3 0 10 It makes me feel like he didn' t learn anything from our relationship or like he thinks he' s better than me because he has someone new and I don' t. I' m trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good I think, but sometimes I feel really really lonely too. Like maybe I won' t ever find anyone. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you' re doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another. EOS 3 0 12 Thank you! Exactly. But it is scary. I am guessing from your name that you identify as male( please forgive me if that is incorrect), so you might not understand what it feels like to be an older woman when your ex starts dating someone a lot younger. Men only get better and more desirable with age, not so for women. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I might not understand that particular aspect, but self worth is still self worth no matter the context. I' d say try not to pay any mind to what he' s up to. The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence, but if you just focus on watering your grass( making yourself happy) then you' ll have a much more fulfilling life. EOS 3 0 14 Haha, watering my own grass. That is a good way to put it. Thank you for talking to me for a few minutes. It makes me feel a little bit better to have someone agree that it is okay to spend time working on me, instead of thinking that it is sad or pathetic or an excuse. I really appreciate it. EOS 3 1 15 [Greeting] Oh absolutely Keri. Thanks for opening up and sharing your experience and feelings with me for just a few minutes. It was great to talk to you. EOS 3 0 16 Have a good night, Jonathan.: -) EOS 3 1 17 [Greeting] Happy Holidays Keri. Keep your head up!

EOS 3 0 2 yes, i want to. i am unable to concentrate in anything. i feel so negative about my life. what is the point of this relationship then?

6 0 0 Hello, how are you?. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 6 0 2 I' m alright, honestly I' m feeling rather ashamed. The reason for that and the problem that I' m facing is that I' ve had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and I' m only 24 years old. Right now in my life I' m ready to seek help, but I' m having a lot of anxiety about it because I' m very worried about how others will judge me. I' m worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that I will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. I' m ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that I' ve made that have gotten me here and I guess my problem is that I just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that I can just finally make the step that I need so desperately and get help. EOS 6 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I am in a good position to help you as I am in the same situation. Please know you are not alone. I would definitely recommend seeking help sooner rather than later! Hello? Are you wanting to talk? EOS 6 0 4 Yes of course I didn' t hear it go off, my apologies. I really appreciate that, it really is helpful knowing that I' m not the only one who feels this way. I really know that that' s what I need to do, and I am trying my best to get over my fears and just do it ya know. EOS 6 1 5 [Question] What level of alcohol consumption do you have? EOS 6 0 6 no matter how hard it seems, maybe it wont be when I actual do it. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Trust me everyone will be very sympathetic:). Everyone there will be in the same place. And the longer you keep drinking the more damage you are doing to yourself. EOS 6 0 8 and quite a bit, about half a gallon or more a day. And thank you, I really do appreciate your help. I know that and I know its time for me to better my life because its no way to live ya know. Id like to grow up and have a normal life(:. EOS 6 1 9 [Others] I am not sure how much half a gallon is to you... I am in the UK and I know it differs between the US and UK:) EOS 6 0 10 thank you, i do feel better about going now. I just dont know what to expect and it can be scary sometimes. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You will be treated with respect at all times. You might even find that you make some new friends:) Ping:) EOS 6 0 12 You' re right, and that' s what I probably need also is some friends who are in similar positions. EOS 6 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' d recommend online message boards.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! What can I do to help? EOS 0 0 1 Hello, I' m not sure if there is any help? Without knowing when I can return to work, I will probably remain anxious about the unknown. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m glad to speak to you today. It sounds like you are having anxious thoughts. Can you tell me more? EOS 0 0 3 i am self employed, selling event tickets on the internet, but because of covid, all events are postponed until it is safe to gather in large numbers. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how you might feel anxious. There are lots of uncertainties right now. I am sorry you are going through this. Are you able to find work or help from the government? EOS 0 0 5 thank you; fortunately, i have been able to collect unemployment assistance, especially created for self employed people during this difficult time. however, that is due to expire in a few weeks, so once again i am growing anxious about finances. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Living with uncertainties can make anyone feel anxious. Have you tried getting outdoors for a small walk or hike?. EOS 0 0 7 yes, I try to walk outdoors every day, for at least 30 minutes. it does help a lot. but with the weather turning colder, that may be difficult to continue. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It is so important during stressful life events to take care of our minds and bodies. It sounds like you have been making good choices! Have you reached out to family or friends for advice or perhaps help with supplemental employment?
1 0 0 My friend borrowed money from me but she won' t return it now. EOS 1 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry about that. It is always hard when we trust someone and they let us down. is that waht you are feeling? Disappointment in your friend? EOS 1 0 2 Yes, i am very dissapointed because i trusted her completely. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand. I have been through a similar situation. Was it a large amount of money? EOS 1 0 4 What did you do to come out of the tricky situation? Yes, it was for me, a total of$ 10000. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, That is a very large amount of money. I can understand your being upset with them. Have you talked to them about the money and returning it? EOS 1 0 6 Yes, i am very very upset. What would you do in my position? Yes, she just sounded non - comittal, saying that she will return it when she can. EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. It is a financially difficult time for us all. I am wondering if your friend might be upset and embarrassed that they can not pay you back immediately? Have you asked her if she could even afford some sort of small payments? EOS 1 0 8 Yes, i asked her how we could restructure the payment in her favor because i understand how difficult it is for everyone right now but she did not answer. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Were you speaking on the phone or in person? Is this a financial burden for you? Would you consider this person a good friend? Would you be sad if they were not in your life anymore? EOS 1 0 10 We were speaking on phone because i wanted to set up a physical meeting where we could discuss the logistics. Yes, it is a financial burden because this is money i was saving for a venture. EOS 1 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] That is very difficult. It is hard to judge things on the phone.
0 0 0 hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hi. How' s it goin'? Are you feeling troubled about something this morning? I know it can be hard to talk about personal problems sometimes. I have a lot of trouble with that myself.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi like I said a bit down. EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I did not see that, I am sorry. Do you want to talk about it? It might help. EOS 4 0 3 Ohh thank you for the offer. Proscanation is my thing i guess, and this days I am paying for it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Is it affecting your work or your home life? EOS 4 0 5 Yes it affects everything. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Can you give me an example of something that has been affected recently? For instance, I had been putting off cleaning my house and then some friends dropped by without warning and I was mortified. EOS 4 0 7 I didn' t meet deadline a year back, and lost my job. Now I couldn' t even pay rents. Living with a sibling. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That sounds bad. Have you considered you might be suffering from depression? EOS 4 0 9 Probably. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You sound quite lethargic. I think you should see a GP? EOS 4 0 11 Thank you. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you feel as though life is hopeless and there is no way forward? EOS 4 0 13 No no no... me the super optimist. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] Well that is something:) What are you looking forward to?
3 0 0 Hi, How are you doing? I am in bad mood.. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] What' s wrong? EOS 3 0 2 This work from home tension and cant go out with my family and parties. It makes me depressed and cant bear this pathedic situation. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. I, too, am struggling with COVID - 19. It' s going to be difficult not to see family during the holidays. We' ll get through this, though, don' t you think. Have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone? Maybe there is a way to find ways to have fun online with your friends and family. We actually played games together recently. Is that something you could do to reconnect? EOS 3 0 4 I am fully occupied with my job. This software field sucks me. Even weekends also they are expecting to work with offshore people. I dont find the time to spend with my partner and kids. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there any way you could talk to your supervisor about achieving a better work life balance? EOS 3 0 6 Yeah! Good Idea, I ll make a call with my Manager once. It could be better to have vacation for a week. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like that could make a big difference in changing things for you. You just need a better work/ life balance to straighten things out. I had a similar experience in the past, and talking with my manager about time off reinvigorated me. EOS 3 0 8 Exactly. Please suggest me any idea to spend my time with my family and away from this work pressure. Sounds good! I ll arrange a conversation with my head then. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] With COVID - 19, it may limit your options, but you could decide which activities you would collectively enjoy the most, and try to do them as often as possible together. EOS 3 0 10 Absolutely, then i ll help my family with household chores and make them free. Then we have some quality time to spend together! EOS 3 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Yes, giving them a helping hand, getting things done together, could greatly improve your home life. Are you feeling any better since we started chatting? EOS 3 0 12 yeah! Thank you so much! It is good to have a conversation with you! Now I am feeling better. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] That' s terrific to here. I' m happy you' re feeling better. hear* - sorry for the misspelling.:)
4 0 0 Hello. Is anyone there. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you today? EOS 4 0 2 I' m doing good. I need some advice. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] What can I help you with? EOS 4 0 4 Lately, my friends started to make jokes about my face being ugly. They even called my face as flat as a pan! What should I do? I see them everyday on the bus. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried confronting them and asking why they are being bullies? EOS 4 0 6 I did and they respond by saying that they are just joking and that I' m handsome. But it' s starting to get on my nerves because it' s all they make fun about every time they see me! EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you are very handsome! They could just be jealous. EOS 4 0 8 Haha I would hope so. Still though, it makes me want to avoid them when I go to school on the bus. What do you think I should do then? EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I understand, school was tough for me too. I suggest you tell them to knock it off or you can sit somewhere away from the bus. EOS 4 0 10 Should I just beat them up with my backpack. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No, beating them up will only get you in trouble and that won' t help. EOS 4 0 12 There' s another bus route. Should I just take that instead. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that could be a good idea if it' s not too far out of your way. EOS 4 0 14 I think I will. Their comments make me very insecure. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could also tell a teacher what is happening. They will help you out. I bet you are handsome! Don' t let it get to you. EOS 4 0 16 The teacher would probably make fun of me!. Thanks it' s hard to look in the mirror now. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Try to tell yourself you are good looking and deserve good things to happen every morning! Look in that mirror and tell yourself good things. EOS 4 0 18 I' ll try to be positive for once. Do you believe working out will help. EOS 4 1 19 [Self-disclosure] Working out will help a lot! When I was feeling down on myself I decided to go to the gym three times a week. It was a great confidence boost. EOS 4 0 20 Awesome. I will start to take care of myself and not worry about others then. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a fantastic idea.
0 1 0 [Question] hello how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hello I am taking a break from my studies to talk. I am fine thanks. Hope you are doing well also. I am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines. EOS 0 1 2 [Self-disclosure] i am fine thanks for asking. EOS 0 0 3 two exams and two assignments due at the end of this and next month. that' s good. EOS 0 1 4 [Others] Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful. EOS 0 0 5 yeah I have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it' s online and basically I do things on my own time.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you taking a lot of courses? EOS 0 0 7 2 courses. but I am pretty much using full time capacity on them. devoting full - time I mean. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] do you like doing school online better than in person? EOS 0 0 9 Have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good the more time you have to devote the better! EOS 0 0 11 I have done both methods. I definitely prefer in - school studies.. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel it is more stressful online?
4 1 0 [Question] how are yo. EOS 4 0 1 Good how are you. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] ok. thanks for asking. what on your mind. EOS 4 0 3 Just been having a rough time.... recently broke up with my girlfriend. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] sounds hard. are you doing anything to help. EOS 4 0 5 Trying to avoid thoughts about her, but every where on social media she is posting about her new guy. It is hard to escape the sadness. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow. in our connected world it is hard to get away. do you want to tell me how it happened. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah it is. Well we have been having trouble staying closely connected since the lockdown. We tried to make time for one another, but it has been tough. I was the one who broke things off because I know longer felt much love coming from her. I felt neglected and I thought a break up was the best solution. I did not think she would pick up a new guy two weeks later. I was not prepared to deal with this kind of pain and it hurts. EOS 4 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It was wise of you to know your feeling towards the relationship and make a mature decision for the both of you. During this pandemic too. that must have been even harder..
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing. EOS 6 0 8 Yeah, people don' t know that just because my two friends go" Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two( so - called) friends? EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] definatly not... have you tried explaining your situation to them? EOS 6 0 10 No, they don' t know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID - 19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time? EOS 6 0 12 I might be able to do that. EOS 6 1 13 [Others] unfortunatly it is right now very comen this situation, so no shame for that, EOS 6 0 14 Well, I used to donate a LOT in year' s past. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] a lot of times donating time to help organisatiosn is more valuable then money. EOS 6 0 16 Great point. EOS 6 1 17 [Others] times and situations change so thats ok. EOS 6 0 18 My friends may like to know that I am trading time.... instead of donating money. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i worked for a non profit and the biggest struggle was to find volunteers to help out. EOS 6 0 20 Yes, you make a good point. EOS 6 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I feel that is a great donation and if they do not like that tell them money is easy to give time not.
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! How are you today? EOS 3 0 2 Ok I guess. I do not know how to tell my husband that I am lonely and I want out of the marriage. EOS 3 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, that sure is a heavy subject and a heavy thing to be on your mind. EOS 3 0 4 He is not one you can talk to he usually just brushes things off. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have tried to discuss your loneliness with your husband before? EOS 3 0 6 Yes he tells me it’s just in my head and I could just go out with him, but he drinks then to much so I do not like going out with him. EOS 3 1 7 [Question] I am sure that is frustrating! Does he drink at home as well or just when you go out? EOS 3 0 8 Just when he goes out I do not go with him I do not drink and drive. And he hangs with some obnoxious people. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Would a date night at home with take - out and a movie just the two of you be an option? EOS 3 0 10 He would go to sleep, and then he thinks I am crazy he says we are no kids anymore that need to go on a date we are married. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you think you both might be open to talking to a marriage counselor? EOS 3 0 12 I want that but I doubt he will talk he tells me he has no problems I have them, and all it does is I doubt myself. I turned this situation in every direction and I just am not able to find a solution. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, what about you finding a counselor for yourself who could help you with your own self - care? Perhaps it could be a start and then he/ she could help you end your marriage if you still want to. It took me awhile to learn my own value and how important self - care is. EOS 3 0 14 You know what I like that idea. Maybe you are right I might get then some self esteem as well again. EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I know from experience that our self esteem suffers when we' re in an unhappy marriage. It takes a lot of courage to seek help so I applaud you! EOS 3 0 16 Thank you you are very kind. EOS 3 1 17 [Greeting] I' m glad I could help and I wish you the best of luck!
1 0 0 I' m qualified for a promotion but my boss is refusing to promote me based on biased feedback he has received from someone else. EOS 1 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn' t willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right? EOS 1 0 2 Yes that' s right. It' s frustratgn.* frustrating. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co - worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective. EOS 1 0 4 Unfortunately I can' t really talk to anyone at work because there is no one I trust to this extent. Promotions are a bit of a sensitive issue. EOS 1 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you reported to your HR department the issue around biased feedback being used as a determining factor in not being considered?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, I' m here to listen. What' s going on? EOS 0 0 1 Thank you. I' ve lost my job and I' m very nervous about the future. As a result I am having a hard time sleeping. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Wow, that' s very hard. I would be anxious too. EOS 0 0 3 That makes me feel a lot better. Have you ever lost your job? EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I have. I was laid off. It was nerve - racking, but also really sad. EOS 0 0 5 What helped you get through it? EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I had a bit in savings, but I looked for new jobs mostly. I was on unemployment insurance for about a month before I found a new job. Have you made any plans yet about how to move forward? I can offer some suggestions if you would like. I know about a lot of resources.
6 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there! How may I support you? EOS 6 0 2 Well, I' m really upset with my friends. EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I am so sorry to hear that. Did something happen? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, they aren' t taking COVID seriously. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns? EOS 6 0 6 Yes but they get angry with me. I don' t know how to get through to them, EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It' s also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right. EOS 6 0 8 I really don' t know I just haven' t been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out. It' s a weird dynamic. EOS 6 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you' re finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it' s the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right? EOS 6 0 10 That' s exactly right. EOS 6 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is such a hard position to be in. it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance. EOS 6 0 12 I' d like to think so but I wish they would too. It' s hard to know what is right. EOS 6 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have found that having vitural movie nights, or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected. Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try? EOS 6 0 14 Yes, but they' ll have their BBQs and parties anyway. They are having a group Thanksgiving and there will be a lot of people there. My husband and I feel bad that we aren' t going, but we also know it isn' t smart. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can' t live your life in fear, and that they' re going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware. EOS 6 0 16 We feel like after this is all over, they will still remind us that we were standoffish during this time. And I agree. The longer we put it off and don' t take it seriously, the longer it will last. EOS 6 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Can you tell them that that just isn' t the case? You and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others. If I am correct, it has nothing to do with the fact that you don' t want to see your pals and family! From chatting with you it sounds like your relationships with these people is incredibly important to you. EOS 6 0 18 Yes that' s totally accurate. Yes they are. They are good people. They just think living for the moment is the bigger picture. EOS 6 1 19 [Greeting] I hope your friends can see how important they are to you and thats a huge reason why you' re not seeing them. EOS 6 0 20 I think they do. They just think that this is a hoax. EOS 6 1 21 [Self-disclosure] I know a lot of people that think the same thing. I have one friend who thought that, and they ended up contracting COVID. Thankfully she was ok, but after she got it she definitely didn' t think it was a hoax anymore. I hope they understand the risk they are taking. EOS 6 0 22 That' s scary. Yeah I don' t think they get it. EOS 6 1 23 [Greeting] I am proud of the choices you are making and I hope you can take some comfort in knowing that you are doing your part in helping keep things under control. There is a strength in numbers and the more people who understand that the faster it can be controlled.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling pretty good right now.. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk to me about? EOS 4 0 3 I have a friend who knew me since I was little. She is a little older than me. She still treat me like I' m still little. I tried to explain to her that I' m a grown woman and I grew out of lot of things when I was a kid.. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Is she listening to you? I know how it feels to be patronised by people who are older. EOS 4 0 5 She still didn' t get it. I want our relationship to move further but with her like this. I feel sad. Is there anything I can do? EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Well, if she is not listening to you when you try to talk to her you have to ask yourself whether the relationship is really worth it? EOS 4 0 7 That' s true. I didn' t think about it. Should I approach her and talk about it before? EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I think it' s always worth fighting for a friendship but there does come a point when it stops being at all viable. EOS 4 0 9 Yeah, that' s definitely true. I know she is a good person. So I would give her a chance and we can talk about it before. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Does she have younger siblings? I am the eldest of four and I sometimes, even at age forty five, find myself trying to tell them what to do. EOS 4 0 11 She have a younger brother that is 9 years younger. She used to be only child for a while before her brother was born.. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It could be the cause of her behaviour.
4 0 0 Hi I am so sad my boyfriend was cheating and broke up with me when I found out. I don' t think I can ever be happy again. EOS 4 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self - esteem is that true? EOS 4 0 2 I have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. I have lost interest in everything I can barely make myself go to work. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better? EOS 4 0 4 Maybe, why would he cheat? I have seen her she is not that pretty. I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination. EOS 4 1 5 [Others] remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren' t right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else. EOS 4 0 6 I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn' t want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn' t mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that. EOS 4 0 8 I trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. I thought we were so perfect together, I don' t want him back I could never trust him again, I am not sure I could trust any guy right now, I am so hurt and confused. I don' t ever want to feel like this again. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] relationship issues, especially when they and suddenly can be one of the most stressful periods in an adults life. you are not alone in that other people have been through similar experiences themselves. EOS 4 0 10 This was the first guy I ever lived with, I thought we would get married one day. How do people make it through the pain, it actually hurts. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?. EOS 4 0 12 I have a couple acquaintances at work but I wouldn' t want to discuss my personal life with, my mom said to have a good cry but I almost couldn' t stop once I started. He was my best friend and who I talked to once we got together I didn' t seem to need anyone else which looks like a mistake now. That is why I am here for support. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ok I understand. It is normal to be upset in a situation like this. When I ask if there is someone to talk to, I meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup. There are also support groups out there that can really help. Getting your emotions out and seeing that others struggle with the same issue may be a very good thing. EOS 4 0 14 Have you ever had a break up of a serious relationship or know someone who has? Does the aching inside ever get better? How long will it take? EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] When I was younger, my girlfriend cheated on me. We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it' s better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married. I loved her but after she cheated, I couldn' t stand the sight of her. I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy.
3 0 0 Hello, I need some help with this. EOS 3 1 1 [Others] I' m here to help you. EOS 3 0 2 What should I do about my break up? EOS 3 1 3 [Question] When it was happened. EOS 3 0 4 It happened yesterday. She broke up with me. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh.. It' s really sad. But don' t worry. You can explain feelings to her. She may change her mind. EOS 3 0 6 I will try but I don' t think she will want to listen. I do not think she likes me anymore. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I understand your feelings. If it is a true love, she will also understand your feelings.
3 1 0 [Question] Good day. How is the weather? EOS 3 0 1 cold and snowy here. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Not to warm here. Where do you live. EOS 3 0 3 PA. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] That is a cold state. How can I help you today? EOS 3 0 5 going through a depression due to a job loss. EOS 3 1 6 [Others] That is understandable. Was it because of the virus. EOS 3 0 7 No. I was hurt at work. EOS 3 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] PA got hit hard with the virus.
0 0 0 Hi. Hello, can you help me? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I hope so. What kind of problem are you having? EOS 0 0 2 I am really struggling with my studies at the moment, I am so anxious that I keep putting off my essays and worrying all the time. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are a student who is having trouble. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, I am a mature student and struggling with my course. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand how you feel. I was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school. It is very understandable that you are feeling stressed, especially with the pandemic and other issues happening. EOS 0 0 6 yes, the pandemic is making it worse. I am working as well so I am struggling juggling them all and running a house. I just don' t know how to get back on track with my studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about putting together a schedule to help you manage your time? EOS 0 0 8 How would I go about that? EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you go online, there are different templates for students. One would be a time management template where you fill in the blocks of different times of the day. Also, do you know any of your classmates that you could email or text for support? EOS 0 0 10 okay, I can see the sense in that. Have you used them before, if so would you recommend putting everything on there or keeping it flexible? I do have a couple that i could contact, I' ve been feeling really embarrassed to contact them, like they might think I am being silly. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] To start, fill in one week to see what all activities you have to do. Set aside specific time for doing your schoolwork. Try and stick with the schedule. EOS 0 0 12 Okay, one week doesn' t seem too scary. I could colour coordinate it, I like things in colour. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] . I would try it. EOS 0 0 14 Ok, do you think I should reach out to my classmates, will they think i' m being silly, I really don' t want to alienate them. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe there is a discussion board where you could be anonymous. Break your writing down in small chunks. Just brainstorm one day, for example.
1 0 0 Hello I am having pro\ blems with a friend. EOS 1 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so so sorry to hear that. What has been going on? EOS 1 0 2 Sometimes she is very friendly, but sometimes she is super rude. In a way that is so rude that it has never happened before by someone who I consider a friend. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] Oh wow, it sounds like shes not a very good frined. EOS 1 0 4 As nice as she is, every once in a while show will be equally nasty. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] Have you tried talking to her about it? EOS 1 0 6 Super snarky comments. Yes I have tried. But it still continues. EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried seperating from her? EOS 1 0 8 I can' t she is a colleague. So unless I want to get a new job. but she is super helpful and nice 99 percent of the time. And when I have spoken with her, the last time I was very clear with her that it was inappropriate, and it hasn' t been happening as often, but the whole situation is still very hurtful. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s so hurtful. Do others feel the same as you? EOS 1 0 10 Yes, I have heard these complaints from one other person. Do you have any ideas or other suggestions for me. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you can try talking to yoru manager next time it happens? It is hard but you can only really control yourself, so you need to try to emotionally distance yourself from when she is terrible. You seem like a good persn. EOS 1 0 12 That is a good idea to talk to a manager. but there is no avoiding working with her because of the nature of my job. but that is an option that I didn' t considerr before so thatnk you for your insight. Thank you that is very nice. Let me know if you have any other ideas as well. EOS 1 1 13 [Self-disclosure] Of course!! managers are erally helpful. I had a similar sitation with a coworker two years ago and the head of my group really helped me clear it up. EOS 1 0 14 Did you try other things as well. EOS 1 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I tried really hard not to let her get to me. Which was really hard but doable.
2 0 0 Good afternoon/ evening. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you tonight? EOS 2 0 2 Doing great. How about yourself? EOS 2 1 3 [Question] I' m doing well how can I help you tonight? EOS 2 0 4 So, the issue I' m having is work - related. My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He' s also in the middle of testing for CP. My job requires that I be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask... but sometimes the people I am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6 - foot boundary. A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills. My son just turned 2. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you' d wish they wear a mask?
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? EOS 1 0 22 He' s a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly. EOS 1 0 24 But maybe I deserved it. EOS 1 1 25 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly. EOS 1 0 26 Yes, he did. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No you did not! Please don' t think like that. EOS 1 0 28 I' m just so angry that I could break something. And maybe I will do that! EOS 1 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this. EOS 1 0 30 But what if it doesn' t pass? And I cannot afford therapy. EOS 1 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now. There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free. EOS 1 0 32 I don' t know if I could do that. I don' t like talking about my problems with strangers. EOS 1 1 33 [Self-disclosure] And yet here we are: P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found.. I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that I was. EOS 1 0 34 Do you have any suggestions about how to open up to people I don' t know? EOS 1 1 35 [Others] I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No - one will be judging you. EOS 1 0 36 That' s what I am afraid of. Being judged by people. EOS 1 1 37 [Question] Do you think that this might partly because your ex has eroded your self esteem?. EOS 1 0 38 Probably. He called me a lot of names. EOS 1 1 39 [Others] The important thing is to gradually rebuild your self esteem. Do you have any things that you excel at?. EOS 1 0 40 I' m good at bowling. And I like riding horses. EOS 1 1 41 [Others] Animals are a wonderful source of comfort when we are feeling very low! Could you join a riding club to make some new friends? EOS 1 0 42 Maybe I will do that. Horses are so cool. EOS 1 1 43 [Reflection of feelings] I can feel that you are starting to make progress already and are thinking of things that you can do post break up. EOS 1 0 44 I sure am. Thanks for your help. EOS 1 1 45 [Greeting] You are most welcome. Is there anything else you would like to talk to me about? EOS 1 0 46 I don' t think so... EOS 1 1 47 [Others] Well, I wish you all the very best for the future. I know that things seem terrible right now but please believe me they will get better.
4 1 0 [Question] HI there, How are you doing today? EOS 4 0 1 Its hard for me to find a job. things could be doing better. it' s been a bad week for me. EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] I understand that, it is hard to find a job. I got terminated during the beginning of covid. EOS 4 0 3 Yea, i got laid off in July. the market has been tough. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I actually took a job at walmart just to make ends meet. Not the best situation but hey, my family can eat. EOS 4 0 5 thats good. i' m an engineer and i would like to take another engineering role. but they are hard to come by now adays. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea, would you consider doing something lesser for now just to make sure you have some income coming in? Or do you still collect unemployment at least?
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Much better than normal, even though the stock market is down. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Are you an investor? EOS 0 0 3 I am a student that tries to put as much money into as possible. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I can certainly understand the struggle with being at that stage in life. Has this affected you negatively? EOS 0 0 5 No the stock market really doesn' t cause stress for me, mostly just small things that I think my brain overreacts to. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] What sorts of things? EOS 0 0 7 Kind of a variety of things. I typically get bad anxiety after a night of going out. So I am trying to cut out drinking. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety? Do you suffer from anxiety when you do not drink ever? EOS 0 0 9 Sometimes but I think the root from them comes from when I do something while I' m drinking. Not that I do anything bad, but I just don' t like not remembering things. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] So you would say that you drink to the point of blacking out? Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you' ve had a reasonable amount of alcohol?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hi, how are you feeling today? EOS 3 0 2 I am not feeling the best. I have been having some depression, because of not being able to see friends and family during this pandemic. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Oh, boy, do I know that feeling! How are you dealing with it?( if I may ask) EOS 3 0 4 I try to message them as much as possible and call them on the phone but it is just not the same as actually getting to give the a hug and see them in person. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] I know that. I use Zoom, just to see them... do you have a computer? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. That works for some of my family but I have family in the nursing home that does not have access to computers. I haven' t seen them in several months. It just breaks my heart. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh. I can feel it. I have someone who' s sick as well. Do you have any one friend with whom you can share your feelings, your depression. I understand you' re having issues with depression, right? It sometimes helps me to feel that we' re all in this together. And, at the other end of this, we will be able to give the biggest hugs ever! EOS 3 0 8 Yes. I have some very dear friends that have helped me a lot. I guess the depression is just worse because it is the holidays and this is the first year that I haven' t got to spend it with my extended family members. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Oh.... That' s so tough... it being the first year!!!! Sometimes, I cry( I cry with my cat), and just to say the feelings out loud makes me feel a bit better. EOS 3 0 10 Yeah. I have a little dog that has been my cuddle buddy. I have had him for 13 years so he has seen me ugly cry many times. What are some things you do to deal with depression? EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I try to read, watch programs or podcasts that take away my negativity. Anything that will give me a lift, so that my own depression won' t get so bad that I can' t remember what it felt like to be a bit happy. EOS 3 0 12 That sounds like some good advice. I think I will try to find a good podcast or a good comedy series that I like and spend time doing that. It' s hard to be sad when you are watching something funny or listening to something funny. Thank you for the good advice and the listening ear. EOS 3 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I wish that I could listen to more.... this thing is so slow. Remember, we' re all in this together, and we will come out the other end. Isn' t it OK to be happy a bit, even though this takes such a toll on so many people? EOS 3 0 14 That is so true. I guess we tend to feel guilty if we feel happy since there is so much sadness in the world right now. But you are so right about the fact that we will come out on the other side. It helps to remember that bad things don' t last forever. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, and are you somewhere where you can walk or exercise a bit? I always feel better if I can move around... dance... something active. What I find helps me the most is to remember that we need to stay safe and be OK, so that we will be here to celebrate when this is over. EOS 3 0 16 Yes. I live in the country so I can go for nice walks when the weather is nice. Staying safe is definitely important right now. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh... it' s fortunate that you live in the country. Can you take some deep breathes and watch the trees, the animals, and nature.... they are all here for us??? EOS 3 0 18 Yes that is exactly what I do. Thank you so much for your help today. You have made me feel better just having someone to vent to. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Keep venting, if it makes you feel better. I know I do when I can talk to someone I don' t know. Is it nice where you are today, so that you can look at something bigger than the indoors?? That often helps me feel better.
3 0 0 hello. anyone there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with today? EOS 3 0 2 am not fine. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What is it that is making you feel this way?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 The season has me down. No family around. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Are you finding time to do things you enjoy by yourself? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 3 trying to work and write but lack motivation. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are feeling some lethargy in this cold season, and feel as though you have no support from your family. EOS 0 0 5 I don' t talk to anyone. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any plans to spend Christmas with family or friends? That may help to break the cycle of feeling low? EOS 0 0 7 I live in a hotel currently. No family or friends around, especially with the virus. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What do you do for work? Are you able to get out of the hotel frequently? EOS 0 0 9 I am a writer. Witht he virus it is hard to meet anyone. i am only here until next week then I have to go to Virignia. My children r all over the country. EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I agree, it is hard to spend time with people at the moment. We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted. It would be good to have something positive to look forward to. EOS 0 0 11 I try the dating sites, but they seem to far away or impersonal. Hope things are better. Just the current season ahs me down. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I can see that. Keep in touch with your family and try to think of positive, happy times you can all have together in the future. EOS 0 0 13 No verbal communication makes it hard. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Can you call them? EOS 0 0 15 I try but the loneliness is the hard part. EOS 0 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this loneliness is really getting to you and you are struggling to see a way forwards. As you are a writer could you perhaps try to make some online friends in forums?

EOS 4 0 4 Lately, my friends started to make jokes about my face being ugly. They even called my face as flat as a pan! What should I do? I see them everyday on the bus.

EOS 4 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you are very handsome! They could just be jealous. EOS 4 0 8 Haha I would hope so. Still though, it makes me want to avoid them when I go to school on the bus. What do you think I should do then? EOS 4 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I understand, school was tough for me too. I suggest you tell them to knock it off or you can sit somewhere away from the bus.

1 0 0 My friend borrowed money from me but she won' t return it now. EOS 1 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry about that. It is always hard when we trust someone and they let us down. is that waht you are feeling? Disappointment in your friend? EOS 1 0 2 Yes, i am very dissapointed because i trusted her completely. EOS 1 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand. I have been through a similar situation. Was it a large amount of money? EOS 1 0 4 What did you do to come out of the tricky situation?

Have you talked to them about the money and returning it? EOS 1 0 6 Yes, i am very very upset. What would you do in my position? Yes, she just sounded non - comittal, saying that she will return it when she can. EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. It is a financially difficult time for us all. I am wondering if your friend might be upset and embarrassed that they can not pay you back immediately? Have you asked her if she could even afford some sort of small payments? EOS 1 0 8 Yes, i asked her how we could restructure the payment in her favor because i understand how difficult it is for everyone right now but she did not answer. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Were you speaking on the phone or in person? Is this a financial burden for you? Would you consider this person a good friend? Would you be sad if they were not in your life anymore? EOS 1 0 10 We were speaking on phone because i wanted to set up a physical meeting where we could discuss the logistics. Yes, it is a financial burden because this is money i was saving for a venture. EOS 1 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] That is very difficult. It is hard to judge things on the phone. EOS 1 0 12 Yes, this is a really close friend from way back and i would be devastated to lose the friendship. It is difficult to judge on the phone yes, which is why i wanted a physical meeting but she snapped at me and said that she will just pay me when she can. EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I see.

0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship?
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 hello. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How can I help you? EOS 0 0 3 I need ways alleviate stress while studying. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there. EOS 0 0 5 yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you' re in a dead end situation. EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck. EOS 0 0 7 How did you push past that job? EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work. EOS 0 0 9 Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career? EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too. EOS 0 0 11 Is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Can you give me some more details? EOS 0 0 13 I just find the work mundane and way too remedial. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is completely understandable. EOS 0 0 15 did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job? EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have you a few, there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit. EOS 0 0 17 what types of skill can I gain online? EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Indeed is one of the better ones to look for jobs, honestly I would suggest looking at jobs that you normally wouldn' t and see what kind of qualifications they need and see if you can get that done online. EOS 0 0 19 so filter based on my absolute needs and go for online skills that I can complete? EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes I think that is a great idea, look for jobs that meet your needs and figure out what you can do to look attractive to employers. EOS 0 0 21 I have tried glassdoor before, have you had any luck there? EOS 0 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used it a bit, I mainly used indeed.
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m really stressed with school exams. and I' m struggling with anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Ah that sounds tough, why exactly are you stressed? EOS 0 0 4 I have 3 big exams coming up at the same time, and they' re all really important for my final grade. I know I' m going to badly because I haven' t been learning well during the pandemic. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Okay, I understand, I see how that can also make your anxiety worse. Currently, on a scale of 1 - 10 how well are you understanding your course material? EOS 0 0 6 Probably 4. My roommates are just so loud and inconsiderate, I can' t make any progress studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s completely normal you haven' t made any progress. That would make things so hard and I applaud you for coming so far with that going on! EOS 0 0 8 I guess so. But if I fail or do badly on my exams it' s really not going to be good. I' m on a scholarship and have to keep above a 3. 0 gpa. EOS 0 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Would you say your problems start with your roommates? EOS 0 0 10 They' re the biggest problem right now. But I think having to learn from home is the main problem. It' s so hard in a tiny room with just a laptop. No library, no office hours, no study groups. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand, the same goes for me. It can be hard to keep up with grade expectations especially when money is on the line. EOS 0 0 12 Are you a student too? EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] Yes, and I completely get it! Its so hard to self - manage without the right resources. EOS 0 0 14 Yeah, I wish the professors and university would be more flexible. When the pandemic first started, we didn' t have grades, and that was really helpful. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] Ah and then they started rolling in, correct? EOS 0 0 16 Yeah, even though nothing has really changed. I feel like until way more people get the vaccine, we' re still in the pandemic. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Me too, unfortunately for us, universities don' t seem t have the same sentiments. For starters, I think it would benefit you to eliminate the more closer problems: your roommates. Have you tried talking to them? EOS 0 0 18 Thanks for that suggestion. I have tried, but they are immature and just want to party. I' ve started staying in my room which helps, but is very isolating. I wish I could afford my own place. EOS 0 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] Makes sense, isolation makes it hard to form that connection. I can see your dilemma. Are you currently working?
3 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hi, I' m pretty much down. trying to keep my head afloat. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] im sorry to hear that. Would you care to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 3 0 3 I lost my job some months back and it hasn' t really been easy for me. EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sorry to hear that, loss of income can be very stressful. Have you been looking for work since then? EOS 3 0 5 Sometimes when I enter a place where my friends are, they tend to go silent when I enter the room. Yes. Its been months now and nothing yet. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Why do you think it is that they go silent? EOS 3 0 7 I' m pretty sure they were talking about me. 2 of myy friends have been helping me with rent money. and I' m pretty sure they must be fed up. EOS 3 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried picking up odd jobs maybe cleaning for someone or helping them move or organize there things? EOS 3 0 9 Yes I have. That' s what helps with feeding and getting some little things at home. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Have you asked them if this is causing problems? EOS 3 0 11 and sometimes I pay back little of what they loan me since I know I cant pay all of it. EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could offer to do some things for them in return for the money so its not like they are just giving it to you. EOS 3 0 13 I' ve playfully asked why did they all go silent when I walked in, but they try changing the topic to something else. I babysit sometimes. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would let them know that i notice it happening and it is starting to concern you and if it is the problem you would gladly do some things for them to earn it rather them just giving it to you to help out. EOS 3 0 15 It' s not as easy as you say it. I feel I' m no longer needed. like an outcast. EOS 3 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure if it was a major problem when you brought it up one of them would have spoke up, I would try not to worry to much over that and focus more on finding a job. EOS 3 0 17 Okay. Thanks. EOS 3 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Sometimes when i have to much free time on my hands i start to feel the same but when i find away to fill the time i no longer feel useless. No problem, I hope you feel better soon!
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hi, I feel really sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am sorry. What is going on?
2 0 0 Hello. Maybe you can help me calm down. I just found out that I' m losing my job in January.( 1) EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hello! I hope I can. I am so sorry to hear that. That' s so rough. There are so many people going through this right now. EOS 2 0 2 Yes and that worries me even more. More people competing for the same jobs.( 2) EOS 2 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a fare worry but you can' t be discourged. YOu need to think positively. You can use this as a time to reconnect with family and to get your resume together. EOS 2 0 4 I will have to do a new resume definitely. It' s been awhile.( 3) EOS 2 1 5 [Question] That' s a good activity!! Do you have anyone who can help you with it? EOS 2 0 6 I' ll have to think on that, I have a friend that might be able to help but it' s been awhile for both of us( 4) EOS 2 1 7 [Question] Do you have any hobbies you can work on while you' re home? EOS 2 0 8 Well I don' t think they are hobbies, but there are things that need to be done around the house. Guess I can keep myself busy at least( 5) EOS 2 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s really helpfuL! staying busy is good. It' s also really good time to reconnect with a loved ones and friends. You can try virtual connections. EOS 2 0 10 Yes, but I know I' ll also have a lot of work to do to get ready to find a new job. I' m really hoping I can find one before I lose this one( 6) EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] HAve you been searching online sites? They post so many nowadays! If you spend a few hours a day. i' m sure that you' ll find one in no time!! EOS 2 0 12 I looked at indeed and I did apply to one thing. But when it came back to me it said that 4970 other people had applied for the same job!( 7) EOS 2 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That happens but keep looking. It' s a numbers game, so you have to just apply to a ton them once your resume is ready.
3 0 0 Hello, I' ve been really depressed lately and feel like there isn' t anything I can do to break this feeling. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened? EOS 3 0 2 November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS( its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 4 Yes that is correct. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest. EOS 3 0 6 I know I' m not alone and that' s what makes it hard to reach out, because I don' t want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there' s. It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do. It seems that you don' t want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person. EOS 3 0 8 I just don' t know what to do about it anymore. Yes, I don' t like to bother others or let other people down. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure. Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief? Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think? EOS 3 0 10 It is a lot, I' m used to being the person that everyone comes to for help, but I am not very good at asking for help myself. I have seen a doctor and they started my new medicine regimen but unfortunately there is no cure for this disease. I was going to physical therapy but finished that right as Covid started.. Plus it does get better as the weather gets warmer so the winter has been hard, really looking forward to spring and summer for a little relief. EOS 3 1 11 [Others] I' m sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now. EOS 3 0 12 I' d be open to doing Yoga once things open back up, but having this disease puts me in a high risk category so my interaction outside the home still has to remain limited until we develop some heard immunity. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know. Sunshine is always best cure for a better mood. Did you try to maybe walk or drive around your neighborhood for some fresh air? Oh, then drive around might be the only option. EOS 3 0 14 I' m hoping to get out and go for walks once the weather warms up, unfortunately right now there is still some snow on the ground and it' s not quite warn yet being in the northeast. EOS 3 1 15 [Others] Ye. You did the right choice. Safety is always the first concern. EOS 3 0 16 I did take walks along the path in our development last summer so the cabin fever wasn' t as bad as it seems to be with all the snow that basically kept me inside all of february. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Does where you live have a online social activity group on FB or an app called Neighbors? That could be a good way to communicate with others in a safe way. EOS 3 0 18 The local FB group is only full of everyone complaining about everyone else( seems when everyone is home things seem to get on peoples nerves more so then when people could get away from home consistently) but I' ve never heard of the app Neighbors, I' ll have to look into that. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Give that a try. Maybe you will meet some friends there. EOS 3 0 20 I will definitely have to look into that. EOS 3 1 21 [Greeting] Sounds great. I' m glad you didn' t give up seeking for solutions to make yourself feel better. EOS 3 0 22 Getting someone else' s perspective helps because like you recommending that app, there are things I don' t know about out there so I appreciate that. EOS 3 1 23 [Greeting] You are welcome! Glad I can help. EOS 3 0 24 You did thank you, and I hope you have a good day and a great weekend and stay safe yourself! EOS 3 1 25 [Greeting] You too. Have a great weekend!!
0 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 I am fine thank you. How are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am very well. Do you have any problems you' d like to discuss with me? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I am having trouble figuring out how to handel a situation with a friend. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ah, can you give me a few more details? I am sure I will be able to help/ EOS 0 0 5 Her husband was justshot and kiled over a drug deal. He was high on drugs at the time. My dayghter and his daughter are good friends and we carpool with them every day. He was often the driver not my friend. Was he high when he was driving my daughter arround? Did my friend know he was on drugs? EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow that is a tough one - I can see why you would be concerned about it. At least, though, you can be assured that she is safe and is never going to come to any harm as a result of his driving now. EOS 0 0 7 Agreed but it is hard to not be suspicious that the mom knew something about hi actions. Yet I feel horrible that she lost her husband. EOS 0 1 8 [Others] I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it:( EOS 0 0 9 I know. I am trying to be supportive and help her with her kids but a part of me is still anxious that she may have played me. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] People can hold values that to other people seem strange. She might not have considered it wrong to be driving on drugs, even though it is. EOS 0 0 11 Very true. I really never even considered that! EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would not make it acceptable though! EOS 0 0 13 No, absolutely not! But I never looked at it that way. EOS 0 1 14 [Others] At least you can feel relieved that your daughter is safe now:)
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, what brings you to bring the seeker? EOS 6 0 1 I feel upset with myself over my situation. Did you read it? EOS 6 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I did not see it. What is your situation? I am here to listen. EOS 6 0 3 I feel ashamed of my depression symptoms. I feel other people are ashamed of me. EOS 6 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how? EOS 6 0 5 I just can' t live reguarly life like" healthy" people do and they notice my symptoms. They don' t understand how your mind can be your enemy. EOS 6 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are saying that you can' t live regularly and people don' t understand that your mind isn' t working in your favor. Is that right? Can you tell me what you mean by your mind being your enemy? EOS 6 0 7 Like I have no interest or motivation to do ANYTHING some days. Hard to even take care of my hygiene. My mind doesn' t care to do it even when it' s embarrasing for people to notice. EOS 6 1 8 [Greeting] That sounds very hard. I can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn' t want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself. What do you do to cope?
2 0 0 Hey. I am really scared about my job prospects. I am really fearful about my job situation. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] When did this fear start? EOS 2 0 2 It has been a while. I have had fears going back to my childhood traumas. I think that the work situation has only exacerbated that. The current economic climate has really made me fearful.... not sure if I am going to be able to keep my job. EOS 2 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct? EOS 2 0 4 Somewhat. But, my fears are relevant because I don' t know if I will always have a job. EOS 2 1 5 [Question] Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job? EOS 2 0 6 Do you know what I mean? What say u? I have some, but they have their own problems to deal with. Everyone has problems. Do you know what I mean? EOS 2 1 7 [Self-disclosure] You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me. EOS 2 0 8 It is making me have flashbacks of other traumatic situations, I think I need to find a good support chain, for sure. What say u? You take alooonnng time to respond. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many counselors who specialize in this field of job security and especially during this pandemic and the falling economy, they are great support systems.

EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] chill my dear friend, nothing of that sort will happen. EOS 0 0 3 In - class learning was way better and I learned a lot but now its so confusing. EOS 0 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] everything you need is a little peace of mind, patience and little more effort. EOS 0 0 5 Even working with online tools is hard.

Stop worrying, and think about what can make it better. EOS 0 0 11 Well it is still hard to understand online learning tools. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Watch Youtube videos.
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing. EOS 6 0 8 Yeah, people don' t know that just because my two friends go" Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two( so - called) friends? EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] definatly not... have you tried explaining your situation to them? EOS 6 0 10 No, they don' t know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID - 19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time? EOS 6 0 12 I might be able to do that. EOS 6 1 13 [Others] unfortunatly it is right now very comen this situation, so no shame for that, EOS 6 0 14 Well, I used to donate a LOT in year' s past.

EOS 4 1 5 [Question] In which field you are looking for? EOS 4 0 6 Bus driver and/ or Production. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can try as a school driver. As school now opened You will get it. EOS 4 0 8 That is what I did do but with union rules and bidding rights. There is not enough work.

EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having a difficult time with your finances. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 yes somewhat. i can pay it off within 2 - 3 years without a second job. id like to pay it off faster though. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure it will take dedication and hard work, but I bet you can do it! EOS 0 0 6 I think so. Im doing mturk for a second job right now. it helps some. i don' t know about getting another job. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been in your shoes and also feel that' s a good way to add a little extra income. It can really add up if left to built and used towards a specific goal. EOS 0 0 8 I agree 100%. Been spending it on new clothes and toiletries lately to stock up for the covid shutdown. the extra money helps alot. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It definitely can help. Perhaps you could have a separate way of using some of the money to go towards some of the other bills you would like to pay off? Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns.
0 0 0 hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay just anxious.

EOS 3 0 7 Tell me about! We were planning on moving in together next year. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, I definitely wouldn' t go through with that then. Are you sure he was cheating? EOS 3 0 9 I noticed a few signs and confronted him about it. He didn’t even deny it! He wasn’t remorseful at all... it’s like he doesn’t even love me. How can you love someone yet betray the, somquiclu. So quickly** EOS 3 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] did he admit to it? I would agree that he probably doesn' t feel the way you want him to.

EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed?? EOS 3 0 5 My partner broke up with me impromptu. EOS 3 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now. EOS 3 0 7 Exactly, that is my current situation. I feel like my entire life has been rearranged. How did you deal with them and specifically what was your coping mechanism? EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days. I slowly realised that i had put myself in slow motion and then slowly started to do things i used to do to maybe come out of it.
4 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello, How are you today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m really depressed. My fiance left me yesterday. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it? EOS 4 0 3 Yes, I think that might make me feel better. I really have no one to talk to because my family and friends didn' t like him so they think this is for the best. EOS 4 1 4 [Greeting] Ok. I am happy to listen.. EOS 4 0 5 I just don' t understand why someone would pretend to be happy for a year and then decide they were lying and leave. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Seems like you feel your partner betrayed you, does that sound right?.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim.

3 1 0 [Question] Good afternoon how may I help you today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello there. I' m suffering with increased depression and I' m not quite clear why. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately? EOS 3 0 3 No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that' s the same for everyone. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression? EOS 3 0 5 I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I' ve always had a low mood but now I' m anxious that it will continue to get worse. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again?
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling pretty good right now.. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk to me about? EOS 4 0 3 I have a friend who knew me since I was little. She is a little older than me. She still treat me like I' m still little. I tried to explain to her that I' m a grown woman and I grew out of lot of things when I was a kid.. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Is she listening to you? I know how it feels to be patronised by people who are older. EOS 4 0 5 She still didn' t get it. I want our relationship to move further but with her like this. I feel sad. Is there anything I can do? EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Well, if she is not listening to you when you try to talk to her you have to ask yourself whether the relationship is really worth it? EOS 4 0 7 That' s true. I didn' t think about it. Should I approach her and talk about it before? EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I think it' s always worth fighting for a friendship but there does come a point when it stops being at all viable. EOS 4 0 9 Yeah, that' s definitely true. I know she is a good person. So I would give her a chance and we can talk about it before. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Does she have younger siblings? I am the eldest of four and I sometimes, even at age forty five, find myself trying to tell them what to do.
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Same old.. still trying to lose weight. Already on day 20 for fasting. did not lose a single pound. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight. What kind of methods have you been using? EOS 0 0 4 I tried keto diet for 6 months, didn' t work. So now on Fasting. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are really discouraged. EOS 0 0 6 I also go to gym 2 times a week. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow! You have been trying practically everything. You are really motivated. EOS 0 0 8 Yea, very discouraged... EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Losing weight can be difficult. I' ve struggled with that many times. Have you thought of consulting a dietician or a nutritionist to help? Maybe, they would offer some new suggestions. EOS 0 0 10 I am already lucky that I can sometime able to book swimming pool close by. I considered but they said I am not overweight. EOS 0 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] It seems like they didn' t listen to your needs. And it seems like you are doing a great job exercising at the pool and employing other methods to lose weight. What is your primary motivation behind your weight loss goal?
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work. EOS 4 0 14 Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn' t even want me to help her, no she doesn' t work. EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family. EOS 4 0 16 Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] How long has it been since she moved in. EOS 4 0 18 A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you thought about a housewarming gift. EOS 4 0 20 Hmm, no I didn' t think about that, that may be a good idea. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So just a week and she is settling in. EOS 4 0 22 Yes, but the home came furnished and honestly, I didn' t think there was that much to do, but maybe I should get a gift, to break the ice. EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Friendship is important maybe she needs to hear from you. EOS 4 0 24 Yes, it is very important, I just felt if I called I would be bothering her:( EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style. EOS 4 0 26 That is possible, and it is a HUGE house, 4 stories. EOS 4 1 27 [Question] Have you tried to visit her and see if you can help. EOS 4 0 28 No, we are not seeing each other in person due to COVID. Do you think I should try calling or texting first? EOS 4 1 29 [Reflection of feelings] sometimes people get overwhelmed and need a friend to be there.
1 1 0 [Question] Hi - how are you today? EOS 1 0 1 hey! an doing better but things at work place gets me real down. EOS 1 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What' s going on at work that' s making you upset?
4 1 0 [Question] Hey there, what' s going on today? EOS 4 0 1 Hello. It is a fine day, how about yourself? EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] It really is! I am just taking in the fresh air in the backyard. EOS 4 0 3 That is awesome. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Thanks! What is going on in your neck of the woods? EOS 4 0 5 Sort of stuck inside trying to make a dime but it is alright. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Yeah great minds think alike.. do you do anything else for work? EOS 4 0 7 Looking for a good job right now. I wanted to talk about a personal issue I have been having, though. EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Okay, you know I' m here for you. Talk to me, what' s happening? EOS 4 0 9 My father and I had a fight 2 years ago and haven' t spoke since. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] The same happened to me, and then my father passed away. If there is anything I can say, is to swallow pride and cherish the moments you have on earth together. What was the fight over? EOS 4 0 11 Yeah I am afraid that these things can happen. It was only over material things. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] That was my next question, what the fight was over. Do you think he would be open to mending things? EOS 4 0 13 It is weird because I called him out for being manipulative so this is his defense.. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Usually when people feel singled out, they only have a few mechanisms. Unfortunately, most people tend to run away instead of fixing things. It tends to be the easier option.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! What can I do to help? EOS 0 0 1 Hello, I' m not sure if there is any help? Without knowing when I can return to work, I will probably remain anxious about the unknown. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m glad to speak to you today. It sounds like you are having anxious thoughts. Can you tell me more? EOS 0 0 3 i am self employed, selling event tickets on the internet, but because of covid, all events are postponed until it is safe to gather in large numbers. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how you might feel anxious. There are lots of uncertainties right now. I am sorry you are going through this. Are you able to find work or help from the government? EOS 0 0 5 thank you; fortunately, i have been able to collect unemployment assistance, especially created for self employed people during this difficult time. however, that is due to expire in a few weeks, so once again i am growing anxious about finances. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Living with uncertainties can make anyone feel anxious. Have you tried getting outdoors for a small walk or hike?.

EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Living with uncertainties can make anyone feel anxious. Have you tried getting outdoors for a small walk or hike?. EOS 0 0 7 yes, I try to walk outdoors every day, for at least 30 minutes. it does help a lot. but with the weather turning colder, that may be difficult to continue. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It is so important during stressful life events to take care of our minds and bodies. It sounds like you have been making good choices! Have you reached out to family or friends for advice or perhaps help with supplemental employment? EOS 0 0 9 not yet; it is very difficult for me to ask for help. But I may need to do so in the near future. I am fortunate to have a close network of family and friends that I can count on. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am happy to hear you have support during this time. EOS 0 0 11 i would be open to seeking other employment online; work from home on the computer. any suggestions? EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Luckily, there are many platforms online that allow you to work from home. I know of several that allow you to do side" gigs". Perhaps you can search and find a few of these. I, myself have had success doing these.

4 1 0 [Question] Hello there, can I help you with any today?* anything. I am happy to talk to you about any problem that you might be having? EOS 4 0 1 I am having such a difficult time today!!! EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you. EOS 4 0 3 I think that my boyfriend is cheating on me again!!! EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Are you saying that he has cheated on you before? That does not sound very promising. EOS 4 0 5 He has but it was a long time ago and was before we had a talk about exclusivity in our relationship but it still hurt. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Have you considered getting some sort of couples counselling? Or do you just think that he is never going to change? EOS 4 0 7 We tried counselling once.. It was online and we got paid to do it.. I don' t think he took it seriously at the time. He always said he felt like he was being attacked. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that. So you feel that he is not really taking your problems as a couple seriously? EOS 4 0 9 Yes. I feel he thinks of me as some sort of trophy and he does not have to work now that he won me over in the first place. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I have been in toxic relationships before and to be honest it does sound a little as though this is one of those situations. EOS 4 0 11 I have been as well but this time was supposed to be different. At first everything was great but now things are so distant I just don' t know what to do next. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you feel that perhaps it might be time to move on? People who will cheat twice are pretty unlikely to ever change their ways. EOS 4 0 13 That is true. But now we have a kid together and I feel like it would break her heart to lose her dad. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah you did not mention that! Maybe for the sake of your child it might be worth going to counselling again then.
0 1 0 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hello, How are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 am fine. at least for now. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] would you like to talk about it?

Has your boyfriend reached out to you at all to clarify things or to see if you are okay?

4 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello, How are you today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m really depressed. My fiance left me yesterday. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it? EOS 4 0 3 Yes, I think that might make me feel better. I really have no one to talk to because my family and friends didn' t like him so they think this is for the best. EOS 4 1 4 [Greeting] Ok. I am happy to listen.. EOS 4 0 5 I just don' t understand why someone would pretend to be happy for a year and then decide they were lying and leave. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Seems like you feel your partner betrayed you, does that sound right?. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I feel very betrayed.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is understandable. I know how you feel, may I suggest taking a few minutes to clear your head, and making a plan to talk with your friends and parents about how you feel? EOS 4 0 9 They think I should just get over it because they didn' t like him so they think I shouldn' t like him either. They' re making things worse for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] Oh I' m so sorry, sometimes family and friends don' t think about your feelings. When did this happen? EOS 4 0 11 He left yesterday. I had no warning. He just packed up all his stuff and said he didn' t want to marry me and the last year has been a lie. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Dang. he seems very selfish. But I understand how up setting it must have felt. My first husband left me without warning. EOS 4 0 13 I' m sorry to hear that. How long did it take you to feel better? EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Awhile. it started to feel a little bit better after I kept telling myself it was about him and not about me, then I started feeling a bit better. But it will take time, the old say is correct, good days and bad days.. EOS 4 0 15 What did you do to help feel better> EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Started back in to my routine. Work. Church. things like that..
3 0 0 I am so stressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi, what' s going on? EOS 3 0 2 I have a college course in the evening, but I cannot concentrate while distance learning. I am expected to watch the instructor do excel on a tiny phone screen and follow along. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oooff that sounds brutal... especially the excel part! do you have a bigger screen you can use? EOS 3 0 4 It is stressful. I am able to pull up zoom on my laptop, but it is almost more cumbersome because I must switch back and forth. I have to also manipulate an excel as well as watch the instructor. My colleagues in the class are annoying, because they do not know how to use mute correctly. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have access to a second screen or have the ability to stream the class on your tv through chromecast or something? EOS 3 0 6 I don' t have a second screen, but I do have a large TV. I may be able to hook it up via HDMI. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The mute thing is horrible. I have no ideas for that. hahah. I' m looking for help with that too! Yeah try the HDMI hook up you can sometimes find cheap attachements on amazon if you don' t have the right connections. EOS 3 0 8 Sometimes I get really anxious. My ears will be pounding and I feel like I can' t hear anything. It is worse when using in ears, because it' s like all I can hear is my heartbeat. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yeah if you stream it on your tv, you won' t have to wear headphones... that way you can control the volume better too. EOS 3 0 10 That sounds like a great idea. Have you had any weird technological solutions to help you through distance learning? EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' m not really doing any distance learning right now. Just working from home and coincidentally most of my work uses excel. I have constant virtual meetings where I have to show people things via excel. It' s pretty tough but I found if I use multiple monitors it makes things easier. EOS 3 0 12 I have considered making impulse buys to help with some things. Do you know about portable second monitor screens for laptops? It seems almost like a thin tablet that you plug in to your laptop. I like the idea. EOS 3 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] my second monitor is not portable. I don' t know if that would work for me because I work better in one designated spot. So I have 3 monitors on my desk( 2 separate monitors and my laptop screen). however something like That would definitely be something I' d look into if I was in school or taking classes. EOS 3 0 14 I enjoy portability and minimalism to a fault sometimes. I enjoy being able to work from anywhere. Do you live in an apartment or home? EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think that' s a good call! Do you think you can find a deal somewhere on it?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello. EOS 2 0 1 Hello I am in need of assistance. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] I am Tom. How can I help you? How are you in need of assistance? EOS 2 0 3 Hello Tom, this is Dillon.. I haven' t been doing well in my academics. EOS 2 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I have a real talent to provide guidance to people out there in the World. Not doing well in college or high school? Are you in a trade school? Or in academia? EOS 2 0 5 In college. I started off really well until the pandemic hit. Now my family is struggling financially and it has greatly affected my academics. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Well, I went through a similar situation when a pink - eye breakout hurt my school.... I struggled financially, but took any job I could..... EOS 2 0 7 What kind of jobs did you take? EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Work part - time and go to school part - time. EOS 2 0 9 I' m trying to find a steady job. jobs that can help support both my family and my tuition. EOS 2 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest creating flyers and ask to be a dog walker. Americans love their dogs. 70 Percent of Americans have dogs. EOS 2 0 11 oh okay that' s interesting. there' s a part time job at a local library should I take it? EOS 2 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I feel that you can be great and be a good entrepreneur..... dog walking doesn' t take a lot of talent. EOS 2 0 13 thank you for that. EOS 2 1 14 [Question] How close in the library? EOS 2 0 15 the library is within the campus. EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Ok, that is good. I once worked at a library. EOS 2 0 17 you did? how was the experience? EOS 2 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I worked in a library many years..... EOS 2 0 19 but overall was your experience working in the library pleasant? EOS 2 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] It was quite pleasant. And the pay was decent. Plus, I got to read and research a lot. I ended up meeting my wife at the library as well. I felt good taking the job.:)
3 0 0 Hello, I' ve been really depressed lately and feel like there isn' t anything I can do to break this feeling. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened? EOS 3 0 2 November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS( its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 4 Yes that is correct. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest. EOS 3 0 6 I know I' m not alone and that' s what makes it hard to reach out, because I don' t want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there' s. It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do. It seems that you don' t want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person. EOS 3 0 8 I just don' t know what to do about it anymore. Yes, I don' t like to bother others or let other people down. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure. Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief? Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think? EOS 3 0 10 It is a lot, I' m used to being the person that everyone comes to for help, but I am not very good at asking for help myself. I have seen a doctor and they started my new medicine regimen but unfortunately there is no cure for this disease. I was going to physical therapy but finished that right as Covid started.. Plus it does get better as the weather gets warmer so the winter has been hard, really looking forward to spring and summer for a little relief. EOS 3 1 11 [Others] I' m sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now. EOS 3 0 12 I' d be open to doing Yoga once things open back up, but having this disease puts me in a high risk category so my interaction outside the home still has to remain limited until we develop some heard immunity. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know. Sunshine is always best cure for a better mood. Did you try to maybe walk or drive around your neighborhood for some fresh air? Oh, then drive around might be the only option. EOS 3 0 14 I' m hoping to get out and go for walks once the weather warms up, unfortunately right now there is still some snow on the ground and it' s not quite warn yet being in the northeast. EOS 3 1 15 [Others] Ye. You did the right choice. Safety is always the first concern.
7 0 0 Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well. EOS 7 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well I can help you study if you' d like? EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material... EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study! EOS 7 0 4 My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted. EOS 7 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version. EOS 7 0 6 Wow, that' s actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me. EOS 7 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot. EOS 7 0 8 That is true. I will reach out to her now. EOS 7 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will do just fine, you can do it! EOS 7 0 10 I still have some self - doubt given that I have failed an exam in the past... EOS 7 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam. EOS 7 0 12 I really appreciate this advice. I am feeling better about the exam and feel like I should envision myself passing and doing well. EOS 7 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, thats the spirit it works for me! EOS 7 0 14 I will give it a try! EOS 7 1 15 [Question] Okay is there anything else I can help you with or should I let you go? EOS 7 0 16 No, I should go study now. thank you for your help. EOS 7 1 17 [Others] Of course anytime, have a goodnight! EOS 7 0 18 You too! Wait! I have another concern. EOS 7 1 19 [Question] Yes, what is that? EOS 7 0 20 Do you have any tips for staying cool under pressure while I am taking my exam? EOS 7 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I do actually. First make sure you get a good nights sleep so your brain can rest and function at its best. Next get to class a little early so you have time to soak up the energy in the room and you get a sense of your surroundings. Take it easy and do not rush. Just one question at a time, next thing you know its over.
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave?
0 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? I am feeling rather sad. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hi there. Yes, What is making you sad? EOS 0 0 2 I feel that my friends do not like me very much any more. Apparently they have been engaging in group activities without me. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities. EOS 0 0 4 Do you think that I am over - reacting? I do not want to sound over sensitive but this has been happening for a while. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you talked with your friends on how you feel? When was the last time you all connected? EOS 0 0 6 We went out for coffee the other day and I thought about saying something cos I know they went to a club without me last weekend but I couldn' t bring myself to in the end. EOS 0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand it is tough to bring up what is bothering you, especially after getting to hang out with all your friend over coffee. I' m sure this was not intentional with not inviting you to the club. EOS 0 0 8 Sometimes in the past I have turned down invitations to go out clubbing, admittedly. Could it be that they just did not think that I wanted to go?. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] From what I have experienced personally, I am not a fan of clubs and didnt want to go with my friends. After turning them down a few times, they stopped inviting as well. I think they thought that was not my thing. EOS 0 0 10 The thing is though that this is not the only thing - they have been to rock concerts without me too. I just feel I am no longer a part of the group. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I feel how this is hurting you. The best thing would be to talk to them about feeling disinvited to group activities. Let them know you are still free and really want to spend some time together. Do you think you can open up to them on whats bothering you? EOS 0 0 12 I don' t know. I don' t want to come across as just being paranoid or whiny. Sometimes I think it would be better to just forget them and not have any friends. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like this situation is really bothering you. Its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated. The bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation. If they don' t know what is bothering you, it will be harder to mend the relationship. EOS 0 0 14 It is making me really depressed and is badly damaging my sense of self worth. I feel as though I am not worth anyone' s time. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You are worth every precious second of time and should not let this diminish your self worth. Find common ground, an activity you all enjoy and invite them to hang with you.
0 0 0 I am very worried about losing my job. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello - How are you today? EOS 0 0 2 Anxious. I think my boss wants to fire me. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am so sorry you are worried about losing your job. I have been in your shoes before. Why do you think your boss wants to fire you? EOS 0 0 4 Thank you. I think if I am late again, I will be let go.. I have a sick child and my boss does not understand. How can I explain that I may be late to the office, but that I am a valuable employee? EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Have you explained to him your reasoning? I also once had to take care of my sick grandmother after work and had a tough time explaining it to my boss. Have you offered to stay later to make up the work? EOS 0 0 6 No. But that is a good idea. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe your boss can compromise with you. It' s worth a shot! EOS 0 0 8 It' s a very competitive office and I don' t want to look weak. EOS 0 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] You sound like you care about this job and that is a valuable asset in a an employee. EOS 0 0 10 I do. I hope I can explain the situation clearly and offer to make up time by staying late. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand. Is there a coworker or mentor that maybe you can talk to? EOS 0 0 12 I will reach out to HR. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s a great idea!
0 0 0 hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hi. How' s it goin'? Are you feeling troubled about something this morning? I know it can be hard to talk about personal problems sometimes. I have a lot of trouble with that myself. EOS 0 0 2 going smooth, i need to get a nice and a surprise able present for my parent, and at the same time I need to pay my house bills. my father understands the situation that my earning is not that much, but my mum will fuck complain that I am taking care of my wife but not her. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you' re having some cash flow issues, right? I can relate to that at a few more points in my life than I' d points in my life than I' d like to recall. It' s so very loving and sweet of you to be putting so much thought into the gift! That isn' t all that common anymore, unfortunately.. Are you currently working? EOS 0 0 4 yes, your are right, I cannot stay in house without paying bills. yes, I am working but the income is not that much. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It is pretty ridiculous how income doesn' t increase along with inflation/ cost of living. Very illogical and crippling to many of us financially. Of course you' ll need to put your rent and utilities above all else, and since the gift you are feeling stressed out about is a parental gift, EOS 0 0 6 that is the major concern, the gift is once in a year and now all my bills are needed to be paid at least before end of the week. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think that you will find out that all your parents really want is for you to be happy and to get to spend some quality family time with you. They love you and want you to be happy and healthy. That is a gift a lot of parents don' t get, surprisingly.. EOS 0 0 8 may be i should use credit card to get her new year present and use my salary to pay the bills and rent. my presence is much important likewise. i will need to be happy and get rid of this fucking depression, I can' t kill my fucking self. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It may sound cheesy to you,, but making a gift for someone is still one of the best ways to tell someone how much you really care. You were willing to give of yourself and your valuable time to actually create a gift.
1 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How may I help you today? EOS 1 0 1 hi. I am stressed with my 25 year old moved back from NYC.. My boyfriend and I have a home and my son does not like him. EOS 1 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I am sorry to hear that i can understand how you must be feeling. Why does your son not like your boyfriend? EOS 1 0 3 He is going back to school and I am supporting him in that. The problem is that my boyfriend thinks my son should speak to me more respectfully. He gets upset when my son is swears and shows anger to me. EOS 1 1 4 [Question] Have you talked to your boyfriend about how you are feeling? EOS 1 0 5 He knows that I am torn. I am not going to put my son out of the house. I am also not one to get loud and angry. My son verbally is aggressive. EOS 1 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand why your boyfriend be getting upset if your son is disrespectful to you and is aggressive but you know that is your son and you going to be there for him no matter what. EOS 1 0 7 Yes, and I have gotten my son to go to a therapist weekly to try to express his anger about the pandemic and the changes it has brought in his lifestyle. He cannot take his frustrustations out on us. EOS 1 1 8 [Question] How long has this been going on? Is the therapist working for him? EOS 1 0 9 He came back last March for what we thought at the time would be a month or two. EOS 1 1 10 [Question] Have you had a conversation with your son about the way he is acting? EOS 1 0 11 He is difficult to get through to. He seems to have traded midwestern charm for NYC bullying. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe he should start seeing a therapist every day maybe that will help. EOS 1 0 13 I am not sure that he can afford that, but I have seen small changes in his behavior since he started seeing her. I want him to stop seeing my boyfriend as the enemy. EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe your boyfriend and your son needs to sit down and have a talk.

EOS 3 1 14 [Question] How bad were you injured. EOS 3 0 15 i have permanent spinal injuries. EOS 3 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Virginia is hard hit.
5 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling today? EOS 5 0 1 uninspired. broken. a rock. a static object. bananas. EOS 5 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, that' s a start. Do I hear you saying that you' re confused at the moment? EOS 5 0 3 not confused. frustrated that I have to produce art for marks when I am not inspired. EOS 5 1 4 [Question] Ah I hear you, education can be both wonderful and difficult can' t it? What are you supposed to produce? EOS 5 0 5 painting after painting. like I am an ikea machine, photocopying picasos for A' s. EOS 5 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that that is very frustrating. Would you consider switching majors? EOS 5 0 7 What is life but a stage. Art is life. I love art.. no. EOS 5 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass. Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of your future and one day it will pay off? EOS 5 0 9 does the sun now set and then rise again. Does the spring not come after winter. Yet I cannot see how art will give me grades. EOS 5 1 10 [Question] Well, I am assuming that you want to go into an artistic field on graduation? EOS 5 0 11 yes, but no like a 9 - 5 job. perhaps i am yet another art failure. art has no time. EOS 5 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you are putting yourself down unnecessarily. Many people do make a lucrative career from an art qualification. I would urge you to keep working to the best of your ability and see what happens. EOS 5 0 13 you speak the truth. I will again pick up my brush and see where my inspiration takes me. oh it has been a joy talking to you. EOS 5 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you ever tried searching for information about careers in your field? We still have a few minutes left:) There are a lot of different ways in which you can use an art degree!

EOS 2 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if you are more comfortable texting him then i would suggest doing that but i would not just say nothing about you buying the car you should just let him know.

EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that' s bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I believe i am going to fail all my finals for college. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] College finals are a stressful time for sure, I' m sure you' re doing your best to prepare. EOS 0 0 6 Yes i have been studying for hours everyday. sometimes it is hard to focus. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes it' s best to take a short break to reset when you feel like your gears are grinding. EOS 0 0 8 that is true, but i feel guilty when i take breaks. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I often feel the same way when I' m not busy doing work. But sometimes you need that little break to get back into the zone and be more productive. EOS 0 0 10 I try to take multiple 5 min breaks throughout my studying but it usually turns into hours breaks lol. its hard to focus. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You sounds pretty stressed about it, make sure you' re getting enough sleep so you don' t get run down.

I' m sure you both provide a benefit to each other while studying. EOS 0 0 16 it is fun when we study together,. i also forget to eat sometimes because im so stressed. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] I also felt that way around finals and with friends, I think it' s important to recognize this is one semester and that it' s equally as important to take care of yourself as it is to pass those finals. EOS 0 0 18 Yes thats the only thing that is keeping me going. This is only for a few days and it will soon end and i will have a break. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It will get better, this is just now and there' s a lot to look forward once you' re through this. Make sure you' re taking care of yourself first and foremost. That will ultimately provide you success. EOS 0 0 20 I can' t wait to be successful one day, but the thought of working also sc ares me. I fell be by myself. thank you so much, I feel relieved. I will take all your suggestions into consideration.. EOS 0 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] From what I' ve seen, you' re not alone in that feeling. It' s a natural fear for just about anyone approaching something new. But there really aren' t any rules, your life and your decisions decide your success. I' m glad you' re feeling relieved. Your feelings are relevant and completely natural. Just make sure to take care of yourself first and foremost, that' s the most important thing.
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 6 0 1 hi. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing? EOS 6 0 3 Well I' m distraught. EOS 6 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel that way? EOS 6 0 5 Because my girlfriend has left me. EOS 6 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard for you. I haven' t personally had to deal with that, but I have had friends that have. How long were you together? EOS 6 0 7 four years. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being together that long must have made that break up difficult. How are you coping with it? EOS 6 0 9 well I' m not really, especially as she' d gone off with someone else. But I' m to blame which makes it worse. EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened? EOS 6 0 11 I cheated on her on a drunken night. It was a one - off and I regret it terribly. But she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain. EOS 6 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I see how she would be upset. It must be difficult for you though because she didn' t give you another chance. Do you have someone to talk to about your feelings? EOS 6 0 13 yeah, I' m not saying I deserved it just wish she had. But no, not really. No - one who would understand. EOS 6 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I would have wanted a second chance too if I were in your shoes. Is this affecting you really bad? EOS 6 0 15 Yeah I feel so low. EOS 6 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If your mood is affecting your daily activities, normally that means your mental health has been affected. You could always talk to a professional if it' s hard for you. EOS 6 0 17 it' s difficult though, to open up. EOS 6 1 18 [Self-disclosure] It is. But trust me, it really helps. I' ve been seeing a therapist recently actually and I love it. I don' t have to worry about judgement at all. It' s a hard step but worth it in the end. EOS 6 0 19 They won' t think I' m to blame? EOS 6 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The job of the therapist isn' t to figure out if what you did was wrong or right. It' s to help you understand your feelings and better cope. That' s why they are so great! EOS 6 0 21 oh yeah, that' s a good point. EOS 6 1 22 [Question] Would you like to talk anything else through? EOS 6 0 23 No you' ve been helpful thanks. EOS 6 1 24 [Greeting] no problem! I hope that everything works out for you. EOS 6 0 25 thanks x. EOS 6 1 26 [Others] I think you' re supposed to end the conversation btw. Have a great day! EOS 6 0 27 oh, am I thanks!( It says I can' t until I' ve chatted for 15 minutes) But you helped with my problem promptly. EOS 6 1 28 [Others] Ok! then we can just wait for the 15 minute mark. Do you know when that will be?
0 0 0 Hi. Is anyone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hi there. EOS 0 0 2 Hi I thought you were not going to show. my anxiety level just increased while I was waiting for you. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Apologies, I have had issues with my connection which should now be resolved. How can I help you today. EOS 0 0 4 I am having a panic attack. I have to come up with 100 by next week to meet my minimum charge. on my credit card. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you need to find 100, have limited time to do this and this is causing you anxiety as a result? EOS 0 0 6 yes it sure is. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, I can tell you are really worried about this and want to find a way to remove the pressure from this situation. EOS 0 0 8 yes any suggestion s. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any friends or family that you can speak to about this? If they were aware of this issue and how much it is affecting you, they may be able to support. EOS 0 0 10 They are swamped with their own bills and we live pay check to pay check. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried contacting the credit card company and explaining your situation? EOS 0 0 12 No I haven' t but if i don' t pay minimum I will get 24% interest penalty. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] that seems excessive. I had a similar situation happened myself once and what I did was transfer the balance of one of my cards onto another. EOS 0 0 14 It is the truth thats why I try to pay off in full but there was such a great deal. but thats a great idea and would give me a little extra time. Thank you. I think Ill go google credit card offers. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] do you think the credit card company has acted irresponsibly?. EOS 0 0 16 no I knew the terms when I signed up a year ago. EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] even so you may be able to refer this situation for review to a financial regulator. EOS 0 0 18 I like your idea of transferring to lower interest one. EOS 0 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can review your rights online as a consumer to see if you are offered any protection under law or legislation. EOS 0 0 20 okay Ill go check it out. thank you.. EOS 0 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m confident that you can handle this and have every faith that you will reach a resolution.
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed! EOS 7 0 7 And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that' s one method I have used.. Thank you for your trust in me.. EOS 7 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don' t overdo it.. EOS 7 0 9 I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible. true, very true.. Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen? EOS 7 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you. EOS 7 0 11 Thanks for sympathizing and understanding.. EOS 7 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation. EOS 7 0 13 ok. That' s true and I have to do more of that. Phone is also a big distraction for me. I heard that it' s best to get it out of one' s reach for best results.. Timer, great idea.. EOS 7 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I struggl ed with focus but once I put my phone away, my focus increased a lot. EOS 7 0 15 I think that' s pretty good advice. I know which room I can do this, but just away from temptation plus having an alarm from the other room to go off after an hour or so of reading. ok, I will employ these methods more.. Thank you for sharing these. EOS 7 1 16 [Question] Of course! Is anything else on your mind? EOS 7 0 17 then hopefully after these two courses are done, I can have renewed faith and maturity after the new year and take new courses with better results.. not much, just academic pressure and how to deal with time management and being contentious.. EOS 7 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, that sounds like a great idea. It sounds like you' re really trying to help yourself grow. EOS 7 0 19 Yes I hope so, because when I was younger, I used to be great at not being distracted so much in my studies and just bang it out real quick and well with my books. and all this is also worsened by the pandemic, I am afraid, of just not having a renewed from the indoor isolation.. EOS 7 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, it' s true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood. I understand how you' re feeling, COVID has affected me negatively as well but I' m just trying to look at the bright side.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, I' m here to listen. What' s going on? EOS 0 0 1 Thank you. I' ve lost my job and I' m very nervous about the future. As a result I am having a hard time sleeping. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Wow, that' s very hard. I would be anxious too. EOS 0 0 3 That makes me feel a lot better. Have you ever lost your job? EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I have. I was laid off. It was nerve - racking, but also really sad. EOS 0 0 5 What helped you get through it? EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I had a bit in savings, but I looked for new jobs mostly. I was on unemployment insurance for about a month before I found a new job. Have you made any plans yet about how to move forward? I can offer some suggestions if you would like. I know about a lot of resources. EOS 0 0 7 I am a gig worker, so I cannot apply for IU. Its very hard, but i also have some savings. What kind of tools would you recommend I use to get through this. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, falling back on savings while you look for more work is good for a while. If you have any food insecurity as a result, there are often local food banks. It' s really not something to be embarrased about, so many people face food insecurity through no fault of their own. You could also give a call to your local social services because they will be able to tell you what resources would be available, whether it' s a vocational program or temporary assistance. EOS 0 0 9 Wow you' re so helpful and encouraging! It' s very nice to talk to you.. Are there any meds you can recommend to help me sleep? EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, if it' s possible, I would talk to a doctor. If you' re looking for Over - the - counter sleep medication, melatonin has helped me in the past. EOS 0 0 11 Wow! I' ve never used melatonin before. Did it really help you? Are you doing much better now? EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] It defiitely helps me fall asleep. It' s a natural sleep aid. If something like that doesn' t work, I would talk to a doctor. I know money will be tight though. Are there any free clinics near you?.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling pretty good right now.. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk to me about? EOS 4 0 3 I have a friend who knew me since I was little. She is a little older than me. She still treat me like I' m still little. I tried to explain to her that I' m a grown woman and I grew out of lot of things when I was a kid.. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Is she listening to you? I know how it feels to be patronised by people who are older. EOS 4 0 5 She still didn' t get it. I want our relationship to move further but with her like this. I feel sad. Is there anything I can do? EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Well, if she is not listening to you when you try to talk to her you have to ask yourself whether the relationship is really worth it? EOS 4 0 7 That' s true. I didn' t think about it. Should I approach her and talk about it before? EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I think it' s always worth fighting for a friendship but there does come a point when it stops being at all viable.
3 0 0 Hello, I' ve been really depressed lately and feel like there isn' t anything I can do to break this feeling. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened? EOS 3 0 2 November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS( its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 4 Yes that is correct. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest. EOS 3 0 6 I know I' m not alone and that' s what makes it hard to reach out, because I don' t want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there' s. It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do. It seems that you don' t want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person.
4 1 0 [Question] hi how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Not good, i am very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i' m sorry. whats making you sad? EOS 4 0 3 My friend just stopped talking to me and she won' t tell me the reason why. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] has she communicated via text or messanger? or has all communication stopped? EOS 4 0 5 She stopped communicating completely. Doesn' t even reply to me texts. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] i' m so sorry to hear that. i had a friend do that to me right after the spring pandemic lockdown. did this happen recently? EOS 4 0 7 Yes, just this past week. How did you deal with your situation? EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] i was upset, but then after thinking about it more, i figured she just was overwhelmed with everything going on. i gave her the benefit of the doubt and texted happy birthday this summer and didn' t hear anything back. can you think of anything going on with her that might cause her to stop communicating?
3 0 0 Hello, is someone there? EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, my name is Jonathan. May I ask who I am speaking to today? EOS 3 0 2 Hi Jonathan, I' m Keri. EOS 3 1 3 [Greeting] Hi Keri. How are you today? EOS 3 0 4 I' m feeling a little bit down today. I' ve been feeling a little bit down a lot lately. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh no. I' m sorry to hear that. What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately? EOS 3 0 6 My ex - husband is moved in with his new girlfriend. They might get married. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh Keri, that must feel awful. Was it a recent separation between you two?
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling pretty good right now.. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk to me about? EOS 4 0 3 I have a friend who knew me since I was little. She is a little older than me. She still treat me like I' m still little. I tried to explain to her that I' m a grown woman and I grew out of lot of things when I was a kid.. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Is she listening to you? I know how it feels to be patronised by people who are older. EOS 4 0 5 She still didn' t get it. I want our relationship to move further but with her like this. I feel sad. Is there anything I can do? EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Well, if she is not listening to you when you try to talk to her you have to ask yourself whether the relationship is really worth it? EOS 4 0 7 That' s true. I didn' t think about it. Should I approach her and talk about it before? EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I think it' s always worth fighting for a friendship but there does come a point when it stops being at all viable. EOS 4 0 9 Yeah, that' s definitely true. I know she is a good person. So I would give her a chance and we can talk about it before. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Does she have younger siblings? I am the eldest of four and I sometimes, even at age forty five, find myself trying to tell them what to do. EOS 4 0 11 She have a younger brother that is 9 years younger. She used to be only child for a while before her brother was born.. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It could be the cause of her behaviour. EOS 4 0 13 Maybe that' s why. She have different personality than me. She is more into logical thinking and she love people and has bubbly personality. While I' m emotional but are social butterfly and after a while, I would need a break from people.. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] How much would it hurt you to end the friendship? Do you think you could make other friends and survive it or is it worth fighting for? EOS 4 0 15 To be honest, there are some times when she made me cry or mad when I get home. I think that over the time and the more older I get, the more I would knowledge my relationship with her.. EOS 4 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] I know that I don' t know her but to be honest it does sound to me like your friendship is a bit toxic.. EOS 4 0 17 I do have other friends that I could purse the relationship farther. I think I just felt bad that I known her for years and she is a good person. It' s just not what I need right now.. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes we really just have to let things go. I know it' s hard but it will probably good for your mental health. I hope that I have been able to help you today! It' s a difficult situation for sure. EOS 4 0 19 Yeah, thank you! You certainly helped me.. EOS 4 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have a great rest of day:)
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all. EOS 0 0 45 Also being far away from him sucks. EOS 0 1 46 [Question] Are you guys FaceTiming or communicating at all other than by texts? EOS 0 0 47 You are being very helpful by the way thank you. We aren' t FaceTiming. I just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it.. EOS 0 1 48 [Greeting] I' m trying my best, thank you for the input! Upset about leaving the apartment? Or was there something else that happened that weekend? EOS 0 0 49 Just leaving him. EOS 0 1 50 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you guys thought about scheduling date nights through FaceTime? EOS 0 0 51 I think he would but he hasn' t been feeling really good about his appearance lately. I asked and that' s what he told me. EOS 0 1 52 [Self-disclosure] I understand that completely, I can relate a lot. EOS 0 0 53 Same. EOS 0 1 54 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If it makes any difference, my partner and I have been doing date nights where we would dress up, put make up on and do our hair and everything as if we were going to the restaurant, and even if it is through Facetime or whenever we see each other in real life, it helps not only with our own self - esteem but also our relationship. EOS 0 0 55 That is very cute. EOS 0 1 56 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could open the discussion with your boyfriend, tell him that you have a date planned over Facetime and you want him to order his favorite dinner, take a shower, do his hair and dress up real nice. EOS 0 0 57 I don' t know if he would be open to that but I could try. He isn' t really the romantic type. EOS 0 1 58 [Question] You have been friends for a long time before getting together, you guys are comfortable with each other, right? EOS 0 0 59 Yes. EOS 0 1 60 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay well you do know him more than I do haha, so what would be his ideal date night? EOS 0 0 61 Probably just being at home. EOS 0 1 62 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hm okay, well I' m sure that if you do propose and organize something for him, even if it is not his favorite thing to do, if he sees that it would make you happy, he will at least consider it don' t you think? EOS 0 0 63 Yeah probably. Things are hard right now though. EOS 0 1 64 [Question] In other ways than financially? EOS 0 0 65 The financial things make things emotionally hard. I am one of the only people he has in his corner right now. EOS 0 1 66 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I' m sorry to hear that... it must be difficult for you to be in this position, I understand the stress and pressure. Is the pandemic the reason he is having also financial difficulties at the moment? EOS 0 0 67 Yes sort of. He was let go cause of covid. EOS 0 1 68 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that. Has he also been in the search for another job? EOS 0 0 69 Yes he' s trying unemployment. EOS 0 1 70 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m confused he isn' t trying to find a job?
0 0 0 Hello my situation is that I' m facing an enormous amount of academic pressure. EOS 0 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello. Academic work can be overwhelming at times. I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though. Could you tell me what the issue is in particular? EOS 0 0 2 It' s just a huge amount of work that I' m struggling with and a ton of exams and they give me a lot of anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming. Make sure that you try to be as prepared as you can. When you feel capable of doing well on said exams, you will feel a lot less pressure. EOS 0 0 4 Do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though? EOS 0 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have an academic councelor you can talk to? EOS 0 0 6 yes it' s all virtual though. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well at least is something. I am sure talking to someone who might be able to guide you academically will be a significant relief.. EOS 0 0 8 That is a good idea. Do you personally recommend anything on how to balance my schedule and still be able to have my time to do other things? EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] When I was at college, I usually aimed at 2 hours of studying everyday(+ homework) and I also aimed to have at least 2 hours of leisure time. EOS 0 0 10 I see, and how were you able to maintain a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep and healthy eating habits during college? EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I honestly didn' t eat very healthy. If you live with your parents, I think a proper nutrition is easier. I usually slept around 7 hours each night. I picked most of my classes on the afternoon, worked out in the mornings. EOS 0 0 12 okay i understand, and what do you suggest for when you do poorly on an exam that you studied so hard for, how do you keep yourself from feeling down? EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest talking to the professor or an academic advisor to explore strategies that could help you improve. EOS 0 0 14 okay but is it normal to be upset? EOS 0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course, it is normal to feel upset. However, you should not blame yourself. No one is perfect.

0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you doing today?
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here.
3 0 0 hi there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! what seems to be bothering you today? EOS 3 0 2 currently, i am living in a house with my brother, which i co own and can not afford to move out.. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Is living with your brother a bad thing? What specifically is making you upset? EOS 3 0 4 yes it is. he acts like a azz most of the time. he dosent care about anyone but himself. just like his fiancé. he throws away the bills and expects me to pay to keep the utilities on when they are about to be disconnected. then tells me i dont contribute to the house.. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems like he would be a very difficult person to live with. And that is hard for you obviously. I' m thinking your upset because you can' t leave so you' re stuck. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 6 yes, felling very stuck.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s completely normal to feel that way. I' m sure you' re handling the situation as best as you can. What have you done to try and help the situation? EOS 3 0 8 trying to, looking for every way possible to make money and save it up and move out. really dont want to have to partition the property as its the house we grew up in.. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I would feel the same way if that' s a house I grew up in. I' m so sorry! EOS 3 0 10 i tried to talk to him, in his mind its all my fault he cant pay the bills he had before i moved in. i had been living in california for the last few years, but came back with corona virus on the rise there.. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If he' s in a certain mindset, it would be hard to change that. Do you have people to talk to about this? It sounds like a lot to handle. EOS 3 0 12 right? and his fiancé is the same way, they are both alcoholics and spend most of their income on their habits. its all i can do right now to keep food in the house, let alone running water.. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think it would be good for you to talk to someone and get help. Right now, all you can do is keep chugging along and trying your best to stay afloat. EOS 3 0 14 i have a couple of friends that i have talked to about it, but it just seems like i am screaming at a brick wall and nothing changes.. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest talking to a therapist if your insurance can handle that! Talking with them can help you figure out what you should do. EOS 3 0 16 honestly, i think its him that needs the therapist. he is clearly bi polar like my father was, and dosent want to admit to it. several people have tried to talk to him about it but he just denies it and goes to the other room. i know what a the therapist will tell me, that i need to either resolve the conflict or try and move out, hard to do with the epidemic going on and a lack of funds to do it.. is it normal to always feel helpless? cause thats how its been. either rip everything to shreds or do nothing.. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] Yes it is. Especially now. I just want to encourage to keep pushing. Think about yourself in a year or two from now. Do everything you can right now to get out of the situation. If it gets really bad, don' t be afraid to call out for help( like the police). Stay safe and do what' s best for you. You' ve got this! EOS 3 0 18 police are a very bad idea where i live. they will not prosecute family violence without also prosecuting me. i live in texas, if i press charges, the state will press charges against me. i have several scars from incidents where they told me as such. its really a loosing battle where the law is concerned here.. EOS 3 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] oh wow that' s terrible. that must be so stressful for you. EOS 3 0 20 thank you for listening tho. it is nice to talk to someone outside of my normal circle about these things.:) EOS 3 1 21 [Greeting] yes of course! I hope everything works out in the end. You' ll be in my thoughts:)
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave? EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad. EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more. I feel that everyone must know that I' ve been dumped and be laughing at me. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time. EOS 1 0 10 I did not really have any choice though. I do not see any future for myself now that we are separated. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] do you know brene brown and her work. EOS 1 0 12 No I do not, who is that? EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her TED talk and there' s a great youtube video on empathy.
4 1 0 [Question] Good evening. What would you like to talk about? EOS 4 0 1 evening. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you feeling at the moment? EOS 4 0 3 i lost those books, I cannot even explain, how it happen. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have lost some books? Were they important to you? EOS 4 0 5 I price one of the books, Amazon said 1000. yes. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] So you have lost a book that is worth a thousand dollars? I can imagine you are feeling really bad about that. EOS 4 0 7 where will I g et almost 3 thousand dollars. It is too painful. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I do not know.. have you considered taking an extra job on the side?
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work. EOS 4 0 14 Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn' t even want me to help her, no she doesn' t work. EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family. EOS 4 0 16 Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] How long has it been since she moved in. EOS 4 0 18 A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you thought about a housewarming gift. EOS 4 0 20 Hmm, no I didn' t think about that, that may be a good idea. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So just a week and she is settling in. EOS 4 0 22 Yes, but the home came furnished and honestly, I didn' t think there was that much to do, but maybe I should get a gift, to break the ice. EOS 4 1 23 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Friendship is important maybe she needs to hear from you. EOS 4 0 24 Yes, it is very important, I just felt if I called I would be bothering her:( EOS 4 1 25 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style. EOS 4 0 26 That is possible, and it is a HUGE house, 4 stories. EOS 4 1 27 [Question] Have you tried to visit her and see if you can help. EOS 4 0 28 No, we are not seeing each other in person due to COVID. Do you think I should try calling or texting first? EOS 4 1 29 [Reflection of feelings] sometimes people get overwhelmed and need a friend to be there. EOS 4 0 30 Yes, they certainly do, darn COVID stops everything. EOS 4 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That would be a great idea, especially with the holidays. EOS 4 0 32 Would a text be more appropriate vs. a phone call? What do you think? EOS 4 1 33 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah the virus has stopped a lot of people. EOS 4 0 34 I just feel so hurt and abandoned, like I don' t mean anything to her. EOS 4 1 35 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Why not text her 1st to break the ice. But maybe she is feeling like she is alone also. EOS 4 0 36 Well, I think I will try that, I mean, it' s not that intrusive. I hope she' s not feeling alone, I hope she doesn' t think I' m abandoning her! EOS 4 1 37 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The virus is stopping people but we can find away. Does she have other family. EOS 4 0 38 I am going to send her a message, do you think I should get her a digital gift card as a gift? Yes, she has a son in college. EOS 4 1 39 [Affirmation and Reassurance] The card could be a nice gift.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hi, how are you feeling today? EOS 3 0 2 I am not feeling the best. I have been having some depression, because of not being able to see friends and family during this pandemic. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Oh, boy, do I know that feeling! How are you dealing with it?( if I may ask) EOS 3 0 4 I try to message them as much as possible and call them on the phone but it is just not the same as actually getting to give the a hug and see them in person. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] I know that. I use Zoom, just to see them... do you have a computer?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, I' m here to listen. What' s going on? EOS 0 0 1 Thank you. I' ve lost my job and I' m very nervous about the future. As a result I am having a hard time sleeping. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Wow, that' s very hard. I would be anxious too. EOS 0 0 3 That makes me feel a lot better. Have you ever lost your job? EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I have. I was laid off. It was nerve - racking, but also really sad. EOS 0 0 5 What helped you get through it? EOS 0 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I had a bit in savings, but I looked for new jobs mostly. I was on unemployment insurance for about a month before I found a new job. Have you made any plans yet about how to move forward? I can offer some suggestions if you would like. I know about a lot of resources. EOS 0 0 7 I am a gig worker, so I cannot apply for IU. Its very hard, but i also have some savings. What kind of tools would you recommend I use to get through this. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, falling back on savings while you look for more work is good for a while. If you have any food insecurity as a result, there are often local food banks. It' s really not something to be embarrased about, so many people face food insecurity through no fault of their own. You could also give a call to your local social services because they will be able to tell you what resources would be available, whether it' s a vocational program or temporary assistance.
5 0 0 im depressed and angry. EOS 5 1 1 [Question] why would you say that? EOS 5 0 2 i really want a drink. EOS 5 1 3 [Question] is there anything I can help you with? EOS 5 0 4 i' m an alcoholic. EOS 5 1 5 [Question] do you think a drink will help you? EOS 5 0 6 Just had a stressful day. depressed because if i go get a beer i wont stop. no i guess it wouldnt. it still sucks. i want to be normal lol. i get that thought in my head and its like i become obsessed. EOS 5 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] why not try to put attention in some other things instead of a beer. EOS 5 0 8 hmmm like what? EOS 5 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] its only in your mind. EOS 5 0 10 i hate my mind. EOS 5 1 11 [Question] like working out? it will give you a lot of benefits especially with your health. you can do it! EOS 5 0 12 i actually was thinking of starting again. i did about 15 min this morning. i used to workout like 2 hours a day lol. thank you. EOS 5 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] oh that' s nice. youre welcome! EOS 5 0 14 i actually just switched from beachbody to les mills. i got bored with beachb body workouts lol. having something different is nice.

EOS 5 0 16 i got on a sweet tooth. which i' m mad at myself for lol. i sued to never eat candy and junk food. the past few weeks... ugh. EOS 5 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] just do it with moderation, don' t be mad at youself. EOS 5 0 18 ive always been really hard on myself, i dont know why. EOS 5 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] we all want to eat sweets. EOS 5 0 20 lol. EOS 5 1 21 [Others] no, don' t be like that you know you have to love youself. EOS 5 0 22 maybe i should make some tea tonight. i knowi have to love myself. i just cant figure out how lol. EOS 5 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] hope I help you somehow.
4 1 0 [Question] What is going on today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling really down about my breakup. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] \ So you have had a breakup recently and you are feeling down about it. EOS 4 0 3 Yes. I thought that it wouldn' t be terrible because I initiated it but now I regret it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] So are you doubting that you made the right decision or are you just feeling sadness at the loss you are feeling right now. EOS 4 0 5 I' m mainly doubting my decision and I know there' s nothing I can do about it. EOS 4 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You must have had good reason' s to have made the decision to breakup and to have initiated it. Its normal to doubt yourself afterwards. You may want to remind yourself of the reasons that you came to your decision you did. Im sure the reasons are still valid. EOS 4 0 7 I did it because I' m trying to focus on self - improvement but looking back now, there' s no reason I couldn' t have improved myself with my partner. EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up. In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single.. EOS 4 0 9 That' s what I hope for. I just can' t get over missing my partner because they were great to me, I just needed to be alone. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think you are feeling a loss even though you feel that at this time you need to be alone to focus on your own growth. When you had the conversation about this breakup were you honest about why you need the space and that your problem was not with the relationship but with maybe the timing. I think with communication and after growth perhaps by keeping the door open with this person maybe you can have some sort of relationship in the future even if its friendship or maybe more. You are doing what is right for yourself at the given time.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi! What' s on your mind tonight?. EOS 4 0 1 I think a friend I' ve known for 30 years since college has drifted away from me. Even during the pandemic she has made new friends. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, I' m sorry, that' s not fun at all, especially since you two have been friends for so long. Have you tried reaching out to her by phone, email or social media?. EOS 4 0 3 She has cut our conversations short by saying she is tried. She will return text but I feel like I am always initiating. She likes watching tv show and told me with her NEW friend they Facetime and watch TV together. I really hate watching TV so don' t want to offer to participate. EOS 4 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, it' s a positive sign that she hasn' t blocked you completely. I agree, texting her each day could irritate her. That' s okay! You shouldn' t do anything that isn' t fun or enjoyable or comfortable for either of you, in my opinion. EOS 4 0 5 I am jealous that she is more successful in making new friends. I have not made a new friend in over 10 years. EOS 4 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life. EOS 4 0 7 I don' t have many other friends and they are out of state. The one we are talking about lived an hour away but we would see each other 4 to 6 times a year, EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you' re saying you feel hurt and depressed at not being able to make new friends easily in the pandemic, correct? Ahhhh.,..... yes that; s difficult, oh boy. EOS 4 0 9 Hurt, mad, jealous. I have trouble getting out enough to make friends - even if there wasn' t a pandemic. I work a lot. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] For the time being we' re all stuck at home mostly, so maybe take some comfort in that in a strange way. Heck I rarely see my friends - maybe once a year, so I know how that feels. EOS 4 0 11 Good to know I' m not alone. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] On the bright side of things, at least you have a job. Do you enjoy your job? Maybe start friendships with coworkers, possibly. EOS 4 0 13 Work place is very small and I' m not in the clique there. Vaccine will be available to my age group soon and the weather is getting warmer. So there is that to look forward too. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] How often do you get out for fresh air? Sure it' s not going to solve the lack of friends but it does help to clear your mind to go outside the next few months after work.

3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there how can be of help? EOS 3 0 2 I am suffering from low mood and general depression. I don' t know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down( obviously) and there doesn' t appear to be any real reason behind it. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue? EOS 3 0 4 I felt this way for a while actually isn' t a recent change it' s been building slowly over time. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same? EOS 3 0 6 I think I know what you mean. It' s getting worse. I feel very down. EOS 3 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse. EOS 3 0 8 Yeah. I worry that I' ll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. I' m really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Firstly, you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with depression and it' s good that you have reached out for help for this. EOS 3 0 10 Any suggestions on what to do about it? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many reasons people have depression. It is a recognised medical condition and the good news is that there is help out there. The first step is recognising the problem. EOS 3 0 12 Ok well there is definitely a problem. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] Have you spoken to friends and family about this? do they know how much you are struggling with it at the moment? EOS 3 0 14 not really I don' t want to bother other people with my problems. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. I think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help. EOS 3 0 16 Yeah maybe. I suppose nobody really understands but I could at least speak to them about it. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] everyone has problems and it is good to talk about them because a problem shared is a problem halved. It doesn' t mean the problems will go away but it might help you understand them and then be able to deal with them better.

EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am very sorry to hear that i have also lost a pet earlier this year his name was fish and was only 3 years old he unfortunately passed due to liver cancer. It was a very trying experience but slowly the pain of his passing has got a little bit easier. Have you tried talking about this loss to friends of family? EOS 3 0 5 No. My family lives in another country, and I really don' t have any close friends. EOS 3 1 6 [Question] What have your feelings been like after the passing of your cat? EOS 3 0 7 I feel hopeless. Alone. I feel like a chunk of myself passed along with her. EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Those are completely valid feelings to have at this time. Have you considered getting a small reminder of your cat perhaps a small shrine or tribute to him/ her? Her I apologize for the confusion. EOS 3 0 9 No. I fear that things like that may remind me of her and make me feel worse. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Expressing your emotion is very healthy for example maybe taking up a new hobby or trying something new that scares or excites you to get your mind off of this difficult time. EOS 3 0 11 I used to play videogames before. Now I' m not so sure I would enjoy them. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] What was your favorite genre of video games? EOS 3 0 13 First person shooters and MMORPG' s. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered playing again possibly joining an online team and competing in tournaments?
3 1 0 [Question] hi how' s it going today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you? EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future?
4 0 0 I am so embarassed and saddened. I can not believe he cheated on me. I thought we were going to work out. I was really attracted into him and I cared for him a lot. I wanted to date him longer. Thank Goodness I did not sleep with him. What a disaster. Why are men like this? Why do they break women' s hearts? I wish there were more decent men out there that did not play around. Men can be such pigs! EOS 4 1 1 [Question] what happened? EOS 4 0 2 I met a handsome intelligent man. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how are you feeling lately? EOS 4 0 4 We dated for a month. Then out of nowhere he cheated on me. I' m so sad. I am just trying to understand what I did wrong. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s okay. we should learn from things like this. EOS 4 0 6 That' s true. It' s crazy we have to experience heart ache. To learn... EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] don' t think much and keep yourself engaged in the activities you like the most. EOS 4 0 8 Hey, that is great advice! EOS 4 1 9 [Question] can you tell me how are you before this incident? EOS 4 0 10 I was happy. But when a man breaks your heart, it makes you feel very ugly. EOS 4 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] can you share me some happy memories which made you smile.
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why.
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you? EOS 1 0 2 Not so good. How are you doing? EOS 1 1 3 [Question] I am doing okay thank you for asking! would you like to talk about whats wrong? EOS 1 0 4 Yes. Well today I had a delivery order. So I went to McDonald' s and pick up the order and took it to the right address and after a few hours I notice that the client did not confirm the order. EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am not knowledgeable in this service industry. Let me understand. You delivered the order, but the customer did not confirm they wanted it.. EOS 1 0 6 Five minutes later my supervisor called me saying that the client call and reported that he did not received his order. And that' s not true at all, I gave him the food. So now i don' t know if they going to fired me or let me keep the job. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation? EOS 1 0 8 Of course I did. He told me he going to give me the benefit of the doubt but that is not enough. Im an honest person and this kind of accusation makes me feel very bad. EOS 1 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I understand, but do not feel bad about yourself. You did your work honestly and delivered the food to your customer. Can I suggest something moving forward?. EOS 1 0 10 Yes. But stuff like that makes me look bad and makes people dont trust me. Sure. That can help. I would appreciate it. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe every time you make a delivery, you can take a picture of it for proof. or maybe you can have a copy of the receipt and have the customer sign it as well. EOS 1 0 12 Well. I normally take pictures of every delivery I make but I let this pass and look what happened. EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] it' s okay, it happens to everyone. we are human and we tend to make the smallest mistakes. The important thing is to learn from them.. Is there anything else bothering you at work?
3 0 0 hello. anyone there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, what can I help you with today? EOS 3 0 2 am not fine. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What is it that is making you feel this way? EOS 3 0 4 i was cheated on severally, and it resulted me to end the relationship. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you had to deal with a partner recently cheating and a breakup, is this right? EOS 3 0 6 yes thats it. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this has been stressful for you and you are trying to figure out how to move on from this. EOS 3 0 8 exactly, i can tend to focus because i have given so much time and affection, i never thought i would be called the fool after everything i did. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is incredibly difficult to get something like this off your mind and it seems like you are trying your best to move forward with your life. EOS 3 0 10 i want to move on but i dont know how, i tried to but i just cant. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I have been through this, I learned how to keep myself busy and do things that I enjoy to occupy my mind and let time heal those wounds. EOS 3 0 12 i think you right, maybe i should renew my netflix sub, since i find great interest in movies so as to get some positive vibes and think less of this whole situation. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Science shows that during a breakup sometimes you romanticize the relationship and view it as better than it actually was and missing something that wasn' t as good as you thought. EOS 3 0 14 yh thats true. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] My suggestion is to focus on new hobbies, spend time with friends and family when possible, if you have work you can do in the mean time, if you like to exercise or go outside, all of this is a helpful tool. EOS 3 0 16 this is really helpful, i really do appreciate this suggestions. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] Don' t be afraid to express your feelings and confide in others about your emotions and mental health. It is still a loss and something you should feel comfortable grieving. EOS 3 0 18 Thanks alot, i feel very relieved talking to you alone, i feel like something negative just left me, i know i will be a better person from this day onward. EOS 3 1 19 [Others] I am glad this was helpful for you and hope you will seek further advice if you feel the need to discuss with someone unbiased. EOS 3 0 20 thanks, you are a life saver. gotta go now. EOS 3 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay hope all is well and I can provide resources if needed for you. EOS 3 0 22 i got all i need now. have a nice day ahead. EOS 3 1 23 [Greeting] Thank you and same to you.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello.:) How are you? EOS 0 0 1 I am okay. A little anxious I am feeling helpless. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am sorry to hear that. What are you feeling helpless about? EOS 0 0 3 I am worried about upcoming bills. I lost my job. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I see. I would be worried about that as well. How long have you been out of work?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi my name is Sarah, how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hi, Sarah. I am at my wits end. I feel like I am going crazy. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That sounds stressful. What' s happening? EOS 0 0 3 I am stressed out about having to move and I just can' t seem to calm down when it is time to sleep.. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Moving is such a stressful time. When do you move?. EOS 0 0 5 I am moving in a month, but there is just so much to do before then. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. What is your wind - down routine like in the evening, if you have one? EOS 0 0 7 I usually put my kids to bed and then try to relax for about an hour while I watch tv before I head to bed. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Oh you' re a parent AND you are moving, you have a lot on your plate! EOS 0 0 9 Yes, I am a homeschooling mother of two.. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried a warm bath before bed? that' s helped me before. Meditation to still my mind before sleeping helps too. I' ve read that a small carb snack before bed, like a peice of toast, is supposed to help us fall asleep, I haven' t tried it though. EOS 0 0 11 A bath does sound really relaxing. I have tried some meditations. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One thing I highly recommend is a podcast called" Tracks to Relax". EOS 0 0 13 Thanks, I will have to try that. Music does tend to calm me down. I don' t know why I haven' t tried that. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It' s guided sleep meditations, and his voice is incredibly soothing.... works well for me on nights I can' t naturally fall asleep. He leads you relaxing walks into the forest and such things, it' s very peaceful. EOS 0 0 15 I really appreciate that help, I will try it for sure. I think it will be easier to focus on a meditation with someone talking me through it. EOS 0 1 16 [Question] Have you a partner sharing the childrearing? EOS 0 0 17 Yes, but he has already moved to our new house because he is working on floors and stuff to get it ready. So I have been alone to stew in my worries. EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see so right now you' re the main" parent - er"? Do you have other family that could take the kids for a wekend so you can have a proper rest? EOS 0 0 19 Yes, I am. But, my children are not very stressful. I think they help more than anything. I have wonderful children. I think it is just the thoughts of moving to a new place and the actual 20 hour drive in a moving truck that is scaring me. I really appreciate your support today. It is helpful to talk it out. Your suggestions were also really good. EOS 0 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have wonderful children beccause they have been well parented by the sounds of it:)
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed! EOS 7 0 7 And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that' s one method I have used.. Thank you for your trust in me.. EOS 7 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don' t overdo it.. EOS 7 0 9 I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible. true, very true.. Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen? EOS 7 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you. EOS 7 0 11 Thanks for sympathizing and understanding.. EOS 7 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation. EOS 7 0 13 ok. That' s true and I have to do more of that. Phone is also a big distraction for me. I heard that it' s best to get it out of one' s reach for best results.. Timer, great idea.. EOS 7 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I struggl ed with focus but once I put my phone away, my focus increased a lot. EOS 7 0 15 I think that' s pretty good advice. I know which room I can do this, but just away from temptation plus having an alarm from the other room to go off after an hour or so of reading. ok, I will employ these methods more.. Thank you for sharing these. EOS 7 1 16 [Question] Of course! Is anything else on your mind? EOS 7 0 17 then hopefully after these two courses are done, I can have renewed faith and maturity after the new year and take new courses with better results.. not much, just academic pressure and how to deal with time management and being contentious.. EOS 7 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, that sounds like a great idea. It sounds like you' re really trying to help yourself grow. EOS 7 0 19 Yes I hope so, because when I was younger, I used to be great at not being distracted so much in my studies and just bang it out real quick and well with my books. and all this is also worsened by the pandemic, I am afraid, of just not having a renewed from the indoor isolation.. EOS 7 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, it' s true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood. I understand how you' re feeling, COVID has affected me negatively as well but I' m just trying to look at the bright side. EOS 7 0 21 yes it has on us all. I guess the other thing is that my city has been doing fine so far, but just the past two weeks or so has been more and more cases, so just getting stressed and depressed with that and prospects of a second shut down.. so yes, the second wave is here it seems( belatedly), but hopefully it doesn' t get worse, because I have seen worse in other places right now. EOS 7 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I would suggest taking up yoga or meditation to lessen the stress COVID has on your brain.
6 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 1 Hi there. Can you help me? EOS 6 1 2 [Question] What help you need? please can you explain. EOS 6 0 3 I did not study for a test and I very poorly. I feel ashamed! EOS 6 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] please don' t feel shame you can do it. nothing is hard if we try. EOS 6 0 5 Exactly. I did not try! EOS 6 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] so please try then you feel better. where you feel stuck in studies please can you explain.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how is your day going? EOS 0 0 1 Hello and Nice to meet you. I am doing OK. How are you and thank you for your time. My name is Jim. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Nice to meet you Jim, I am doing well. Is there anything you' d like to talk about today? EOS 0 0 3 I really appreciate your time Yes. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] What is on your mind? EOS 0 0 5 I have been retired for over 2 years and would like to return to the workforce, part - ti me. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are thinking of going back to work?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?.
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday? EOS 6 0 2 I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I' m too scared to do anything about it as I don' t want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can' t help it. EOS 6 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through. EOS 6 0 4 Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I' m a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self - respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it. EOS 6 0 6 What happened out of interest when you had the conversation? EOS 6 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist. Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more. Since that time, he denies everything. EOS 6 0 8 I know. I' m a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It' s superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas' punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends.. EOS 6 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly, its not anyone else' s business. IF you' re suspicions are in fact correct, then you' ve got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart - breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she' s cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o= is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER! Curiously, why do you think she' s cheating? EOS 6 0 10 I' m almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two.. EOS 6 1 11 [Question] Hmm... So have you two live together? How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 0 0 1 Hi, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Greeting] Doing good.. How are you? EOS 0 0 3 I' m feeling really anxious these days. I' m finding the COVID online learning experience to be too much for me at this time. I want to stop school, but I don' t think I can afford to. I need to get done with school. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand your frustration. All of us are challenged due to COVID.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 The season has me down. No family around. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Are you finding time to do things you enjoy by yourself? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 3 trying to work and write but lack motivation. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are feeling some lethargy in this cold season, and feel as though you have no support from your family.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 I am well, thanks for asking. I am doing some studying and taking a break now. Just to talk about some of the feelings, thoughts, and stresses. The big thing on my mind now is the pandemic. And it' s the start of the second wave in my city.. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand what you are going though, indeed it is tough times. EOS 3 0 4 yeah it sure has been since March this year for my city. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So tell me, what are you going through your mind regarding the pandemic and the second wave? EOS 3 0 6 There' s kind of a lag as I am on the East Coast. So the cases didn' t really show up for the second wave until this month, only sporadically last month. But we were doing now until about two to three weeks ago. well fear, anxiety. worries, and also anger that people are being foolish and complacent, especially the youth groups that go to gyms and restaurants a lot, or to gatherings. even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, I don' t know and it just boggles on my mind.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I understand, I' m from the east coast and I' m deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown. EOS 3 0 8 I get that there' s a fatigue but I was there and I had that fatigue and I got over that a few months ago late summer when I tried to reason myself that it was safe to go out when there weren' t any cases then, as the first w ave was gone from my city. I see. Yeah I feel you definitely. like people are becoming impatient but this is not the right time to be. If I can overcome that initial impatience, others should also. If they have no right reason to be out except for work and personal business, then I don' t think they should be doing that too much.. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I think those who are aware of the situation should follow the rules and be aware. We really can' t change the situation because it human nature. EOS 3 0 10 it is. And that' s sad but true. It' s in our nature, as you say. It' s in our nature to destroy and to consume, etc. unfortunate but I can only cope by doing what I feel is right, and continue to do so. and not compromise my values along with others. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] However, we shouldn' t let it affect us physically, spiritually and most importantly mentally. We need stay relax and be aware of whats going on and believe that by following the rules we are doing our part in reducing the speard. EOS 3 0 12 yes I agree also. It' s hard though and it was getting to me even more middle of this year. I was more affected and more emotional. So I do see that I am getting used to it, though how long is uncertain, as the cases rise again. So hopefully I can stay well mentally. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Every night, I give myself an hour to unwind and relax. Things like, enjoying a movie, snack, drink or even favorite candle helps a lot..
6 0 0 Hello, how are you?. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling?
0 0 0 Hello my situation is that I' m facing an enormous amount of academic pressure. EOS 0 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello. Academic work can be overwhelming at times. I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though. Could you tell me what the issue is in particular? EOS 0 0 2 It' s just a huge amount of work that I' m struggling with and a ton of exams and they give me a lot of anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming. Make sure that you try to be as prepared as you can. When you feel capable of doing well on said exams, you will feel a lot less pressure.
1 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you doing? EOS 1 0 1 Hi, I' m ok. How are you? EOS 1 1 2 [Question] Not bad, it' s a peaceful night. Anything in particular you' d like to talk about? EOS 1 0 3 That' s great. My job refused my request to continue to work from home. So I was pretty much forced to go into a school where the cases are growing. EOS 1 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I imagine that' s very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being? EOS 1 0 5 Just to make sure I' m wearing my mask, washing my hands, and social distancing. Which is not enough. There are more and more teachers getting infected and I just feel it a matter of time before it my turn.. I fear that I will bring this home to my family and I will not survive it. I have pre existing conditions. EOS 1 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry that you' re having to deal with such stressful circumstances. You can only control what you can control. Have you discussed these concerns with the school and explained the preexisting conditions? I get it though. It' s scary for everyone at this point. EOS 1 0 7 Yes I have explained to my principal, my team, and got a note from my Rheumatologist. EOS 1 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems to me that they should take that information into consideration. EOS 1 0 9 I feel that way too. I was told it for the best interest of the school that I am there I do not have student in my classroom but I' m forced to help out around the school with students and staff. Teachers are not cared about its just about pleasing the parents it crazy. I can' t quit because there not much to go into now. EOS 1 1 10 [Question] Is there someone else you could go to about this? Besides whoever you' ve already attempted to discuss it with? Yeah you' re right. Covid has been a mess for everyone and affected us in so many ways that e could' ve never prepared for. EOS 1 0 11 I' ve tried contacting HR a few times but I have never received a call back, or my emails answered. EOS 1 1 12 [Others] I mean all you can do is try your best to stay safe but I would continue to reach out to people higher up and see about getting something done. They probably get a lot of calls and emails right now because of everything going on but I would keep trying.
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 I' m feeling pretty good right now.. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Is there anything you' d like to talk to me about? EOS 4 0 3 I have a friend who knew me since I was little. She is a little older than me. She still treat me like I' m still little. I tried to explain to her that I' m a grown woman and I grew out of lot of things when I was a kid.. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] Is she listening to you? I know how it feels to be patronised by people who are older. EOS 4 0 5 She still didn' t get it. I want our relationship to move further but with her like this. I feel sad. Is there anything I can do? EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Well, if she is not listening to you when you try to talk to her you have to ask yourself whether the relationship is really worth it? EOS 4 0 7 That' s true. I didn' t think about it. Should I approach her and talk about it before? EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I think it' s always worth fighting for a friendship but there does come a point when it stops being at all viable. EOS 4 0 9 Yeah, that' s definitely true. I know she is a good person. So I would give her a chance and we can talk about it before. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Does she have younger siblings? I am the eldest of four and I sometimes, even at age forty five, find myself trying to tell them what to do. EOS 4 0 11 She have a younger brother that is 9 years younger. She used to be only child for a while before her brother was born.. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It could be the cause of her behaviour. EOS 4 0 13 Maybe that' s why. She have different personality than me. She is more into logical thinking and she love people and has bubbly personality. While I' m emotional but are social butterfly and after a while, I would need a break from people.. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] How much would it hurt you to end the friendship? Do you think you could make other friends and survive it or is it worth fighting for? EOS 4 0 15 To be honest, there are some times when she made me cry or mad when I get home. I think that over the time and the more older I get, the more I would knowledge my relationship with her.. EOS 4 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] I know that I don' t know her but to be honest it does sound to me like your friendship is a bit toxic..

1 0 0 I' m having issues with my parents. You can say we are having a conflict. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] What kind of issues do you think you are having?
3 0 0 Hello. Hello? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hey how are you doing?.
3 0 0 hello. how are you today? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today?. EOS 3 0 2 a bit sad. more depressed. its just i keep getting benched at work. i' m not really sure what do to.* to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that! I think that would make most people feel upset. EOS 3 0 4 i' m not really sure what i' m doing wrong. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though. EOS 3 0 6 what can i do though? EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought of asking your boss or supervisor if there' s anything going on? EOS 3 0 8 hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though. EOS 3 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] Of course! That sounds frustrating to not know why it' s happening and not have the opportunity to ask. EOS 3 0 10 yes... hrm. that may work. how can i stop being depressed all the time though.. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I' ve also had bosses that are infrequently in the office and make getting good information hard. EOS 3 0 12 how did you fix the issue? i work at home and its like just trying to reach out - they are always busy. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren' t always a reflection of us or how we' re performing. EOS 3 0 14 this whole covid thing has me scrambling to talk to a live person. EOS 3 1 15 [Others] I can imagine! EOS 3 0 16 ok, so just keep pushing and getting good work done? EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I was in a physical office when I had this problem, but the boss rotated between offices. It was hard to wait, but I just kept my head down until the next time she was available. That' s what I did. EOS 3 0 18 maybe i can try that. thank you. i' ll give it a shot. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think reminding yourself that if there was a problem with your work they would be seeking YOU out, and not the other way around. EOS 3 0 20 hrm... that' s a good point! i hadn' t thought of it that way. EOS 3 1 21 [Reflection of feelings] Hopefully that mindset can help you stay positive until you have the chance to speak with them, instead of worrying about what you' ve done wrong. That anxiety feels like what is keeping you down? EOS 3 0 22 i think that will work. it maybe what' s keeping me down. i' ll try yoga too. I' ll give it a shot and just talk with him when i see him online next time. he isn' t online that often because we have 2 separate computers each for our work. well... i hope you have a wonderful night! thank you for all your help! EOS 3 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I really hope that helps keep you afloat until you can get some real answers. Worrying about what - ifs is harder than just knowing what' s goiong on!

4 1 0 [Question] HI there, How are you doing today? EOS 4 0 1 Its hard for me to find a job. things could be doing better. it' s been a bad week for me. EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] I understand that, it is hard to find a job. I got terminated during the beginning of covid.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling today? EOS 4 0 1 Hi like I said a bit down. EOS 4 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] I did not see that, I am sorry. Do you want to talk about it? It might help. EOS 4 0 3 Ohh thank you for the offer. Proscanation is my thing i guess, and this days I am paying for it. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Is it affecting your work or your home life? EOS 4 0 5 Yes it affects everything. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] Can you give me an example of something that has been affected recently? For instance, I had been putting off cleaning my house and then some friends dropped by without warning and I was mortified. EOS 4 0 7 I didn' t meet deadline a year back, and lost my job. Now I couldn' t even pay rents. Living with a sibling. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That sounds bad. Have you considered you might be suffering from depression? EOS 4 0 9 Probably. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You sound quite lethargic. I think you should see a GP? EOS 4 0 11 Thank you. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you feel as though life is hopeless and there is no way forward? EOS 4 0 13 No no no... me the super optimist. EOS 4 1 14 [Question] Well that is something:) What are you looking forward to? EOS 4 0 15 Will achieve my goals with proscanation or not. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] What sort of goals have you set for yourself? EOS 4 0 17 I have pills of written works, short stories, poetry novels and a few paintings, but not published yet. I might do that. EOS 4 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well that sounds very creative! You should definitely publish.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all. EOS 0 0 45 Also being far away from him sucks. EOS 0 1 46 [Question] Are you guys FaceTiming or communicating at all other than by texts? EOS 0 0 47 You are being very helpful by the way thank you. We aren' t FaceTiming. I just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it.. EOS 0 1 48 [Greeting] I' m trying my best, thank you for the input! Upset about leaving the apartment? Or was there something else that happened that weekend? EOS 0 0 49 Just leaving him. EOS 0 1 50 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you guys thought about scheduling date nights through FaceTime? EOS 0 0 51 I think he would but he hasn' t been feeling really good about his appearance lately. I asked and that' s what he told me. EOS 0 1 52 [Self-disclosure] I understand that completely, I can relate a lot. EOS 0 0 53 Same. EOS 0 1 54 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If it makes any difference, my partner and I have been doing date nights where we would dress up, put make up on and do our hair and everything as if we were going to the restaurant, and even if it is through Facetime or whenever we see each other in real life, it helps not only with our own self - esteem but also our relationship. EOS 0 0 55 That is very cute. EOS 0 1 56 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could open the discussion with your boyfriend, tell him that you have a date planned over Facetime and you want him to order his favorite dinner, take a shower, do his hair and dress up real nice. EOS 0 0 57 I don' t know if he would be open to that but I could try. He isn' t really the romantic type. EOS 0 1 58 [Question] You have been friends for a long time before getting together, you guys are comfortable with each other, right? EOS 0 0 59 Yes. EOS 0 1 60 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay well you do know him more than I do haha, so what would be his ideal date night? EOS 0 0 61 Probably just being at home. EOS 0 1 62 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hm okay, well I' m sure that if you do propose and organize something for him, even if it is not his favorite thing to do, if he sees that it would make you happy, he will at least consider it don' t you think?

3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hi, how are you feeling today? EOS 3 0 2 I am not feeling the best. I have been having some depression, because of not being able to see friends and family during this pandemic. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Oh, boy, do I know that feeling! How are you dealing with it?( if I may ask) EOS 3 0 4 I try to message them as much as possible and call them on the phone but it is just not the same as actually getting to give the a hug and see them in person. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] I know that. I use Zoom, just to see them... do you have a computer? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. That works for some of my family but I have family in the nursing home that does not have access to computers. I haven' t seen them in several months. It just breaks my heart. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh. I can feel it. I have someone who' s sick as well. Do you have any one friend with whom you can share your feelings, your depression. I understand you' re having issues with depression, right? It sometimes helps me to feel that we' re all in this together. And, at the other end of this, we will be able to give the biggest hugs ever! EOS 3 0 8 Yes. I have some very dear friends that have helped me a lot. I guess the depression is just worse because it is the holidays and this is the first year that I haven' t got to spend it with my extended family members. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Oh.... That' s so tough... it being the first year!!!! Sometimes, I cry( I cry with my cat), and just to say the feelings out loud makes me feel a bit better. EOS 3 0 10 Yeah. I have a little dog that has been my cuddle buddy. I have had him for 13 years so he has seen me ugly cry many times. What are some things you do to deal with depression? EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I try to read, watch programs or podcasts that take away my negativity. Anything that will give me a lift, so that my own depression won' t get so bad that I can' t remember what it felt like to be a bit happy. EOS 3 0 12 That sounds like some good advice. I think I will try to find a good podcast or a good comedy series that I like and spend time doing that. It' s hard to be sad when you are watching something funny or listening to something funny. Thank you for the good advice and the listening ear. EOS 3 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I wish that I could listen to more.... this thing is so slow. Remember, we' re all in this together, and we will come out the other end. Isn' t it OK to be happy a bit, even though this takes such a toll on so many people?
4 1 0 [Question] How are you feeling? EOS 4 0 1 i feel depresed. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] Why do you feel depressed? EOS 4 0 3 breakup with my partner. EOS 4 1 4 [Others] Breakups can be really tough. How long were you with your partner? EOS 4 0 5 3years of time we have been in love. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I once had a relationship end after 5 years with a partner. Staying active really helped me get over the relationship. Through that activity I actually met my new partner! EOS 4 0 7 but i love my partner so much that i couldnt forget her right now. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about doing something fun, like taking a trip somewhere? EOS 4 0 9 yeah we went for trip we had a god relationship. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really difficult, but I know you can get through this! What do you like to do for fun? EOS 4 0 11 we had enjoyment and romance. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about fun activities you did without your partner?
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why? EOS 4 0 8 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID - 19 lockdowns. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] How long have you been working there? EOS 4 0 10 I am very sad about this country and my work situation. For 5 years. I work in accounting. EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID - 19 really has got us all down. EOS 4 0 12 What a great nation we live in..... a future 3rd world one. Yeah, but I was a good accountant. EOS 4 1 13 [Others] WOW, I' m sure that is a big change for you... EOS 4 0 14 Yeah, I have not told my wife about it just yet. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] I agree, this country has got some issues but we can get through them. Uh, oh, how do you think she will react? EOS 4 0 16 Yeah, I am not sure. I better wait to break the news in 2021. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there. EOS 4 0 18 And I am not the only one who is losing my job. Seems that all of accounting is going to be getting the axe. It makes me sad.... EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year. Do you have a resume? EOS 4 0 20 Plus, I have a 50 dollar a day spending habit on lottery tickets to one day hit it BIG. Yes, I have a resume that I have not updated just yet. I have a college education and a CPA to boot, but I need one lucky break in life. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes that will help to get a better perspective on things... taking some time away from everything in order to catch a breath.

4 0 0 Hello? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] hello. how have you been feeling lately? EOS 4 0 2 Tired. I want to sleep all my problems away. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how long has this been going on? EOS 4 0 4 Well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. I got a hold of a therapist but they won' t talk to me for two days. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s very good that you are going to talk to a therapist. you showed great strength by reaching out. EOS 4 0 6 I am hoping it helps because I feel helpless, especially today and on edge. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night? EOS 4 0 8 I can' t sleep through the day because I have kids but when my ex gets home I just go hide and try to sleep so it' s typically late afternoon. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it sounds like you are doing the very best you can under difficult circumstances. you should feel very proud about that. EOS 4 0 10 thank you. i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] it sounds to me that your sleep issue is really weighing on your mind. you may be setting yourself up for sleep issues by thinking about this so much. is that possible? EOS 4 0 12 yes it may be. i' m not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking. EOS 4 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you' re under a lot of pressure. it' s only natural that you would feel overwhelmed. dont be hard on yourself. you' re doing the best you can. EOS 4 0 14 thank you. that is very supportive. i just dont know how to make the next ten days go by faster.

6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 2 I have been better. I had a rough semester in school.. EOS 6 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So things haven' t been going well at school. I think a lot of people are going through these days.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today?
0 0 0 Hello? Is anyone there? Is anyone there. HELLO? no one is supporting me here..:: twiddles thumbs:: the instructions for the support seeker are incorrect as there is no button that has shown for" the partner' s reasons".. the supporter did not respond. This test is skewed. No one is here to chat with. even after being matched. Ridiculous. hello????? hello? no other messages except my own are showing up. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Sorry, I had a bad connection. Hello, what can I help you with? EOS 0 0 2 Hi. i wasn' t sure anyone was there. i left my job about three months after 8 years.. haven' t found another one.. trying to find one has been challenging. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Just be clear, you' re worried about finding a new job? EOS 0 0 4 well, yeah. in the middle of a pandemic, and being in a new town. all of that has been really hard. and stressful. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is a difficult position to be in. It is a hard time, but there' s always a way to persevere. EOS 0 0 6 yeah... i don' t know... i' m not sleeping well because i' m so worried. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I could imagine that being a constant worry. I understand how you may feel. EOS 0 0 8 thanks for trying to understand. it just seems pretty hopeless. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] No problem. I am encountering a similar situation, looking for a well suited job. Have you tried looking in to new career fields that have always interested you? EOS 0 0 10 Yeah, I am looking in a variety of fields. not much out there that is remote. EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are a lot of jobs in technology where the only requirement is learning a few courses, such as programming.

3 0 0 hi im sad. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Anything particular got you down? Hello. EOS 3 0 2 just life, bad year. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yea bad year for everyone. The virus has really stopped us. Are you working or on layoff. EOS 3 0 4 yes it has, the political turmoil in the United States is very scary as well. I am self employed. but not working alot. EOS 3 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is an understatement with the politics. What do you do. EOS 3 0 6 I am a writer. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I Freelance my self. Do you work for anyone or just in general. EOS 3 0 8 mostly sights that talk about movies. there are a few i submit to. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Good. I write on a forum called Medium. I write and can get paid also. EOS 3 0 10 oh yes i know that one. EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] There are various topics you can write about. Just write and post. Are you a copywriter. EOS 3 0 12 that is cool. a good way to discover other writers as well. I wish, that would be good money. i' m horrible at doing things for others, I need people to pay me to do my thing.. EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I read different postings and have over 30 followers. EOS 3 0 14 awesome, good for you. EOS 3 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] But if you write on Medium you can earn money.
6 0 0 I am having a really hard time with something that I did to my boyfriend. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Do you want to talk about it? EOS 6 0 2 Yes, thank you! I was with him since childhood and we are actually still together. I slipped up one night and hate to admit what I did. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you' re holding onto a lot of guilt about this incident. Are you comfortable talking about that night? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, it is intense guilt. I can' t think of anything else. I hate to tell you but I cheated on him. I am so sorry and can' t look at myself in the mirror. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That can really weigh you down, beating yourself up with guilt. Does he know about the incident? EOS 6 0 6 I feel like I am worthless and I don' t deserve to ever be happy or laugh again. I really do love him and I don' t ever want him to find out what I did. Yes, I cant stop beating myself up. He doesn' t know what I did but he is little suspicious. EOS 6 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You definitely deserve to laugh and be happy. One mistake doesn' t define you! EOS 6 0 8 Thank you! A long time ago his sister told me that he cheated on me and I believed her and so I wanted to get him back. EOS 6 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It says a lot about your character that you feel badly about this, that you can see and recognize you acted in a way you don' t agree with. That' s something to build on. That desire to" get even" is definitely understandable. EOS 6 0 10 I appreciate that and have been thinking about character a lot lately. I do believe he cheated on me first, if that even matters now. EOS 6 1 11 [Question] Do you feel like you got what you needed from the experience, as in, that you' ve" gotten even"? EOS 6 0 12 Yes, I feel very even! I won' t do it again. Can I ever give up the guilt that I feel and move on in our relationship or do I have to tell him what I did? I have known couples who don' t tell each other and they are happy now. EOS 6 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] While it may be true in general that honesty is the best policy, in this case I wouldn' t suggest telling him. It is just going to cause angry feelings. But, the fact you already believed he cheated on you and it motivated you to do the same shows a basic lack of trust in this relationship. That' s something you should really look at. EOS 6 0 14 Thank you for making me feel heard. I have been alone in my thoughts and needed to be understood. Yes, I agree with you and I feel like I kind of let it go now that I told you about it. I am going to be in touch regularly of that' s okay? I feel so much better now. I can take a deep breath again and I want to go take a walk with my dog now. Thank you for all of your time and understanding. EOS 6 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m glad you' re feeling better now that you' ve gotten it out in the open. Of course, you are welcome anytime. EOS 6 0 16 That sounds great because I want to keep this private and I know you won' t tell anyone so I feel really safe here. EOS 6 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Absolutely. This is all in complete confidence.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 Am ok but feeling sad and anxious. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that you are sad and anxious. Do you know what is causing you to feel that way? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I recently lost my childhood best friend to covid 19. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can only imagine how sad you feel from losing your best friend. Hopefully chatting some will help. I know in the past when I lost someone it was nice to just have a conversation to help put my mind at ease. EOS 0 0 5 Sure. I feel so lonely sometimes because we were very close. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that you are feeling lonely. Did you have any mutual friends with your best friend that you can reach out to? I am sure they are feeling the same way and it could help both of you to talk to each other and share stories. EOS 0 0 7 Yes we have mutual friends. I do reach out to them sometimes. But the feeling doesn' t go away. It makes me have sleepless nights. I can' t sleep. Every time I close my eyes I see him very close to me like we are having conversations. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you were really close to your best friend. It can take time to get through the grief of losing someone. Things will get better I promise. EOS 0 0 9 I hope so too. And I hope he is a better place. Have you ever lost someone close to you? EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I lost my father when I was 19. That was pretty tough and it took me years to be OK with it. There are still days a decade later where I think about him and miss him. EOS 0 0 11 Sorry to hear that.. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Time heals all wounds. While that doesn' t sound helpful now it is true. I also found focusing on the good experiences I had with my father( or in this case your best friend) helps. Remembering the times where you both were happy. EOS 0 0 13 I will try to do that. How can I handle this sleepless nights? EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s a tough one. I personally still struggle with sleep for other reasons. Some things that can help is taking melatonin 30 minutes before bed. I have also had some luck with white noise machines or other soothing sound machines. The biggest thing is to not use your bedroom for anything but sleeping; so don' t read a book or play on your phone in bed, you have to train your body that when you go to bed it is time to sleep. EOS 0 0 15 Sounds like stuff I can try out. I have a strong attachment to my phone. Will be a tough one to try leaving it off while I try to get some sleep. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Having a bedtime routine is also another tip. Try to do the same thing every night before bed. Have a consistent bedtime, wake up around the same time everyday, even on days that you don' t have to go to work. Yes, phone' s are tough to give up but soooo many studies show how bad they are for your sleep. I believe in you though, you will get through this.
4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one. EOS 4 0 16 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. What else can I do besides meditation? EOS 4 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds? EOS 4 0 18 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. Candles are much better for me. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad)
1 1 0 [Question] Hi - how are you today? EOS 1 0 1 hey! an doing better but things at work place gets me real down. EOS 1 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What' s going on at work that' s making you upset? EOS 1 0 3 i think boss hate me. EOS 1 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That can be very uncomfortable. Are there reason you feel that way? EOS 1 0 5 nothing i do pleases the man. all he does is complain. EOS 1 1 6 [Question] Ugh - is he like this with everyone else, too - or do you think it' s just directed at you? EOS 1 0 7 i think its directed to me. EOS 1 1 8 [Question] Can you give an example and then maybe we can replay it a different way? EOS 1 0 9 if am asked to complete a task, i do complete them and make sure no mistake was made, if he will evaluate the task he always sees fault in what i do. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hmm= that is frustrating. Can you sit with him and go over each section that he finds fault with and ask how he would have done it? EOS 1 0 11 he never give time to listen. i think i' ll quit the job. EOS 1 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe talk to his secretary and make an appointment with him. don' t quit the job unless you have another one lined up.. EOS 1 0 13 i never tried talking to his secretary. i think that' s a good idea. EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] she' s your first line to getting alone time with him! she' ll get you an appointment for sure! EOS 1 0 15 i try doing just that, i hope it works. EOS 1 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] good. I wish you the best of luck! In the meantime it' s never bad to put out feelers( discreetly) for other jobs.. EOS 1 0 17 thanks so much. EOS 1 1 18 [Greeting] you' re welcome. make sure you bring a list of questions, too! good luck! Enjoy the rest of the weekend.
0 0 0 Hello! How are you today? EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, what seems to be on your mind?. EOS 0 0 2 Friends and our relationships amongst one another. Two are arguing and I want to help both. We only can facetime each other because of Corona and it is taking a toll among our group. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I see. How long have your two friends been arguing? EOS 0 0 4 It has been around 4 months now. It started slowly and now has ramped up to where it' s exploding and causing discourse among us all. One of my friends told a secret to another acquaintance outside of our group. My friend is raging over this which she should. trust was broken. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like tempers are all running pretty hot for everyone right now, is that correct?
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed! EOS 7 0 7 And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that' s one method I have used.. Thank you for your trust in me.. EOS 7 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don' t overdo it.. EOS 7 0 9 I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible. true, very true.. Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen? EOS 7 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you. EOS 7 0 11 Thanks for sympathizing and understanding.. EOS 7 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation. EOS 7 0 13 ok. That' s true and I have to do more of that. Phone is also a big distraction for me. I heard that it' s best to get it out of one' s reach for best results.. Timer, great idea.. EOS 7 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I struggl ed with focus but once I put my phone away, my focus increased a lot. EOS 7 0 15 I think that' s pretty good advice. I know which room I can do this, but just away from temptation plus having an alarm from the other room to go off after an hour or so of reading. ok, I will employ these methods more.. Thank you for sharing these. EOS 7 1 16 [Question] Of course! Is anything else on your mind? EOS 7 0 17 then hopefully after these two courses are done, I can have renewed faith and maturity after the new year and take new courses with better results.. not much, just academic pressure and how to deal with time management and being contentious.. EOS 7 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, that sounds like a great idea. It sounds like you' re really trying to help yourself grow. EOS 7 0 19 Yes I hope so, because when I was younger, I used to be great at not being distracted so much in my studies and just bang it out real quick and well with my books. and all this is also worsened by the pandemic, I am afraid, of just not having a renewed from the indoor isolation.. EOS 7 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, it' s true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood. I understand how you' re feeling, COVID has affected me negatively as well but I' m just trying to look at the bright side. EOS 7 0 21 yes it has on us all. I guess the other thing is that my city has been doing fine so far, but just the past two weeks or so has been more and more cases, so just getting stressed and depressed with that and prospects of a second shut down.. so yes, the second wave is here it seems( belatedly), but hopefully it doesn' t get worse, because I have seen worse in other places right now. EOS 7 1 22 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I would suggest taking up yoga or meditation to lessen the stress COVID has on your brain. EOS 7 0 23 so I suppose just trying to cope with that also because I get nervous having to go out for work or errands, and I also have to write my exam outside of my home.. ok. I could look into that. I work out in general, but have been slacking off on those ever since the pandemic started this year.. EOS 7 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I' d recommend wearing a mask whenever you go out to lessen the chance of you contracting anything. At the moment, it' s all we could do. EOS 7 0 25 yes and I have been and will continue to do that.. EOS 7 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s great! EOS 7 0 27 But aside from these stressors, I think I have a better idea now on how I should proceed, starting today. EOS 7 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that' s amazing, I' m glad I could help put your mind at ease.
0 0 0 hey. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m good, busy. I need another job to pay more bills. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems you are having a difficult time with your finances. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 yes somewhat. i can pay it off within 2 - 3 years without a second job. id like to pay it off faster though. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure it will take dedication and hard work, but I bet you can do it!

EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like your feelings are hurt over a misunderstanding you had with a friend is this correct? EOS 4 0 5 yeah thats correct. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] I see i am sorry that it has you feeling down, did you try to talk with your friend to see if you could resolve your feelings?

EOS 4 0 9 thanks but he totally avoiding me he just blocked me and he ignore me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] how long have you been friends with him?
0 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I am good, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m doing well, but it could have been better. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] What seems to be bothering you tonight? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, my boy friend of 3 years has refused to take our relationship to the next level and I' m kind of getting tired, I don' t want to play games anymore. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don' t feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,. EOS 0 0 6 exactly, I hate to feel that I' m wasting my time. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand that, as I was in a long term relationship and I felt as though my girlfriend at the time did not want to take things to the next step and I was not happy about it.. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I love him so dearly to want to settle down with him, but if he doesn' t want that for me I would rather call it quits now than continue and be disappointed at the long run.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you had that conversation with him? I know it might be a difficult conversation to have, but it is often good to get expectations out in the open so you are on the same page with your partner.. EOS 0 0 10 Yes, sort of and he gave me the impression that he is not there yet and that was a like almost a year ago, I don' t want it to look like I' m pushing him if I try to talk to him again about it. His nonchalant attitude in not seeing the seriousness of it is killing me, I' m just not happy. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] That is tough, but sometimes people just portray things differently, for instance I am also very laid back and nonchalant about most things which can lead to miscommunications.. I don' t think it would be pushing if you haven' t had that conversation in almost a year.

2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:) EOS 2 0 7 It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am in the UK. It' s sort of a grey area... police won' t really do anything but you can' t buy it over the counter. EOS 2 0 9 One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I' m very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially. EOS 2 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot. The US seems to be really strict on it tho. EOS 2 0 11 It varies, state by state, depending on which party is governing. Which you of course have a version of in the UK. Mayoral elections were today yeah? EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] They were but I didn' t pay much attention:) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that' s all. EOS 2 0 13 Oh, well, I' m sorry to hear that. I think participation in local governance is actually the most achievable path for change, but perhaps how it' s structured where you are, it wouldn' t really matter much if you participated. I guess mayorals are only technically local, not like parliamentary elections. EOS 2 1 14 [Others] If I were in London or a major city I' d vote for Mayor. I am in a rural area and we don' t have one: D. I vote for local councillors tho.
3 1 0 [Question] hi there? EOS 3 0 1 Hi. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] how are you? what' s new with you? EOS 3 0 3 I am not doing so great. I fell down some stairs the other day and broke my foot and chipped my two front teeth. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that. I feel you because I had an experience about breaking my bones. It was sad story. how you feel right now. EOS 3 0 5 I am grateful for my family they are taking care of me but I am on crutches and am in a boot when I am not icing my foot. EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Very good. I am glad that you have a good family who can support you whenever you need a help.

EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight. What kind of methods have you been using? EOS 0 0 4 I tried keto diet for 6 months, didn' t work. So now on Fasting. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are really discouraged. EOS 0 0 6 I also go to gym 2 times a week. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow! You have been trying practically everything. You are really motivated.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 I am well, thanks for asking. I am doing some studying and taking a break now. Just to talk about some of the feelings, thoughts, and stresses. The big thing on my mind now is the pandemic. And it' s the start of the second wave in my city.. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I completely understand what you are going though, indeed it is tough times. EOS 3 0 4 yeah it sure has been since March this year for my city. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So tell me, what are you going through your mind regarding the pandemic and the second wave?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 The season has me down. No family around. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Are you finding time to do things you enjoy by yourself? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 3 trying to work and write but lack motivation. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are feeling some lethargy in this cold season, and feel as though you have no support from your family. EOS 0 0 5 I don' t talk to anyone. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any plans to spend Christmas with family or friends? That may help to break the cycle of feeling low? EOS 0 0 7 I live in a hotel currently. No family or friends around, especially with the virus. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What do you do for work? Are you able to get out of the hotel frequently? EOS 0 0 9 I am a writer. Witht he virus it is hard to meet anyone. i am only here until next week then I have to go to Virignia. My children r all over the country. EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I agree, it is hard to spend time with people at the moment. We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted. It would be good to have something positive to look forward to. EOS 0 0 11 I try the dating sites, but they seem to far away or impersonal. Hope things are better. Just the current season ahs me down. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I can see that. Keep in touch with your family and try to think of positive, happy times you can all have together in the future. EOS 0 0 13 No verbal communication makes it hard. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Can you call them? EOS 0 0 15 I try but the loneliness is the hard part. EOS 0 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this loneliness is really getting to you and you are struggling to see a way forwards. As you are a writer could you perhaps try to make some online friends in forums? EOS 0 0 17 It is just the lack of communication. EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear you. Perhaps you could call one of your children now? See if they' d like to catch - up? EOS 0 0 19 without any communication it makes it seem like a battle alone. My daughter is busy and 3 hours away. different time zones amke it hard. EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] Maybe schedule in a call with her for the future? I have been making time to speak with my family every Tuesday, it gives us something to look forward to each week. EOS 0 0 21 Children can only share so much. I chat with her, but the timing is off. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] What are your plans in Virginia? EOS 0 0 23 Find a place to live for awhile. I have to take care of a legal matter. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well that sounds as though it will give you something to focus on. EOS 0 0 25 I just want a person to chat with that we can share with each other. Children r ok to chat with but lack of a female to spend time with is hard. EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps once you get to Virginia you could seek out some groups or activities to find some new friends.

EOS 0 0 3 I am worried about upcoming bills. I lost my job. EOS 0 1 4 [Question] I see. I would be worried about that as well. How long have you been out of work? EOS 0 0 5 About 2 weeks. Christmas is right around the corner. I dont know how I am going to get the kids presents. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there anyone you are able to ask for support right now, like your parents? I am sure they would understand, since so many people have been losing jobs lately. EOS 0 0 7 I don' t have a lot if family.. I have my sister who lives far away. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I see. And your kids are depending on you to be able to take care of them. I am so sorry; I know that must be extremely stressful. Are you married right now?

EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression? EOS 3 0 6 Covid - 19. and money issues. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, this has really been a hard time for all of us. How has it impacted you personally? EOS 3 0 8 my mom and sister had caught the virus they are doing ok now but it was rough. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how hard that must have been. I' m glad they are doing ok now though! EOS 3 0 10 yeah me too. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] How have you been using your time during the crisis? EOS 3 0 12 yeah mostly working and meditation. EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] That' s great! Meditation is also something I' ve picked up during this time. It' s really helpful and can keep you balanced. Do you have a routine or do you just do it sporadically?

EOS 3 0 2 yes, i want to. i am unable to concentrate in anything. i feel so negative about my life. what is the point of this relationship then? EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You seem really focus on just one person. Life is rich. Think about other important people in your life such as parents, friends.

My dayghter and his daughter are good friends and we carpool with them every day. He was often the driver not my friend. Was he high when he was driving my daughter arround? Did my friend know he was on drugs? EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Wow that is a tough one - I can see why you would be concerned about it. At least, though, you can be assured that she is safe and is never going to come to any harm as a result of his driving now.

It should be listed either at the top or on the left side of your screen. I know you' re probably prepping for the holiday. I didn' t mean to interrupt your Sunday.

EOS 3 1 3 [Question] i have big shoulders! whats on your mind? EOS 3 0 4 I' m just struggling a lot to find the motivation to do anything at all, even the most basic of things. Sometimes I get very intense feelings of sadness and just want to drop everything I' m doing, like I can' t do anything more. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] i think a lot of people are feeling that way these past few months. do you think it is covid related? not sickness, more depression.

EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] a few months ago i was feeling the same way. i dont have health insurance but googled and found some online docturs. i got to see a doc and get on antidepressants for less than a hundred. covid plays a factor in EVERYTHING ugh. EOS 3 0 10 So you had the therapy session online with them via webcam or you found them online first then went to see them in person. Yeah covid is doing damage in more ways than one.

0 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? I am feeling rather sad. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hi there. Yes, What is making you sad? EOS 0 0 2 I feel that my friends do not like me very much any more. Apparently they have been engaging in group activities without me. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities. EOS 0 0 4 Do you think that I am over - reacting? I do not want to sound over sensitive but this has been happening for a while.

EOS 0 0 6 We went out for coffee the other day and I thought about saying something cos I know they went to a club without me last weekend but I couldn' t bring myself to in the end. EOS 0 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand it is tough to bring up what is bothering you, especially after getting to hang out with all your friend over coffee. I' m sure this was not intentional with not inviting you to the club.

0 0 0 Hello, I' m having a terrible day. My name is Sean and I work for a large distribution company. EOS 0 1 1 [Reflection of feelings] hi! i' m sorry to hear that. how is your work going so far. EOS 0 0 2 The problem with a job like Amazon or Kehe distribution is the quotas. The pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID? EOS 0 0 4 no COVID 19 has nothing to do with any of this work. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I understand how anxious you are right now. Can you give me some more info on your job. EOS 0 0 6 well when there are 50 million americans out of work right it' s a bit scary. i' m a forklift operator..... I move pallets from one area of the warehouse to another but i. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i totally understand how nerve wrecking this is, but trust me you guys being front - line workers are our real heros. EOS 0 0 8 am based on a quota. I am suppose to be able to move 10 pallets per hour. that' s almost impossible as it is a 1 million square foot warehouse. If i get a pallet on the west side and have to move it to the east side that takes 7 - 10 minutes even if your going dangerously fast. doesn' t feel like it to me. EOS 0 1 9 [Question] did you try discussing your concerns with your Team Lead/ Warehouse Supervisor of your group. EOS 0 0 10 I feel like a replaceable cog in a giant machine that doesn' t give two shits whether I show up for work or not despite having over five years experience with over 12 forklifts..... Yes and they always say the same thing. You need to get your numbers up but it' s a catch 22 you can' t possibly safely get your numbers up and accomplish your quotas. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you are doing your best and are working really hard. EOS 0 0 12 so. EOS 0 1 13 [Question] just a thought - did you try changing roles within the warehouse to a different position? or try checking with the manager regarding this. you have 5 years exp, i' m sure you deserve a better role and pay.

EOS 6 1 7 [Question] have you put in job applications everywhere. EOS 6 0 8 Yes I did, and quite a lot but I think because of the pandemic they are not hiring that much.

The house feels extremely empty now... EOS 3 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am very sorry to hear that i have also lost a pet earlier this year his name was fish and was only 3 years old he unfortunately passed due to liver cancer. It was a very trying experience but slowly the pain of his passing has got a little bit easier. Have you tried talking about this loss to friends of family?

EOS 3 0 7 I feel hopeless. Alone. I feel like a chunk of myself passed along with her. EOS 3 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Those are completely valid feelings to have at this time. Have you considered getting a small reminder of your cat perhaps a small shrine or tribute to him/ her? Her I apologize for the confusion. EOS 3 0 9 No. I fear that things like that may remind me of her and make me feel worse. EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Expressing your emotion is very healthy for example maybe taking up a new hobby or trying something new that scares or excites you to get your mind off of this difficult time. EOS 3 0 11 I used to play videogames before. Now I' m not so sure I would enjoy them. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] What was your favorite genre of video games?
4 0 0 Hi, I' m feeling sad. EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Good afternoon. EOS 4 0 2 Good afternoon to you. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Can I ask for a reason why. EOS 4 0 4 Yes, my best friend has decided that I' m not that important... or as important as I thought I was.... EOS 4 1 5 [Question] What is causing you to be sad. EOS 4 0 6 She used to call me multiple times per day, it' s been 3 days and nothing. EOS 4 1 7 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So this is a close friend. EOS 4 0 8 Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That could cause a sadness. EOS 4 0 10 Absolutely... what do you think is wrong? EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of. EOS 4 0 12 I' m not sure, I don' t think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven' t had a fight. EOS 4 1 13 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work. EOS 4 0 14 Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn' t even want me to help her, no she doesn' t work. EOS 4 1 15 [Self-disclosure] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family. EOS 4 0 16 Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] How long has it been since she moved in. EOS 4 0 18 A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] have you thought about a housewarming gift. EOS 4 0 20 Hmm, no I didn' t think about that, that may be a good idea. EOS 4 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] So just a week and she is settling in.

EOS 1 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] just remember, yesterday is gone. there is really nothing you can do about the situation. you better keep your distance from that particular person. EOS 1 0 9 ok. and i already keep my distance from him. EOS 1 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] learn from your mistake and don' t do it again dear.

EOS 1 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes. it totally depends on how mature the person is. just forgive him and keep in mind for next time whether you should share something with him or not.

0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 2 I' m really stressed with school exams. and I' m struggling with anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Ah that sounds tough, why exactly are you stressed? EOS 0 0 4 I have 3 big exams coming up at the same time, and they' re all really important for my final grade. I know I' m going to badly because I haven' t been learning well during the pandemic. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Okay, I understand, I see how that can also make your anxiety worse. Currently, on a scale of 1 - 10 how well are you understanding your course material? EOS 0 0 6 Probably 4. My roommates are just so loud and inconsiderate, I can' t make any progress studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s completely normal you haven' t made any progress. That would make things so hard and I applaud you for coming so far with that going on! EOS 0 0 8 I guess so. But if I fail or do badly on my exams it' s really not going to be good. I' m on a scholarship and have to keep above a 3. 0 gpa. EOS 0 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Would you say your problems start with your roommates? EOS 0 0 10 They' re the biggest problem right now. But I think having to learn from home is the main problem. It' s so hard in a tiny room with just a laptop. No library, no office hours, no study groups. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand, the same goes for me. It can be hard to keep up with grade expectations especially when money is on the line. EOS 0 0 12 Are you a student too? EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] Yes, and I completely get it! Its so hard to self - manage without the right resources. EOS 0 0 14 Yeah, I wish the professors and university would be more flexible. When the pandemic first started, we didn' t have grades, and that was really helpful. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] Ah and then they started rolling in, correct? EOS 0 0 16 Yeah, even though nothing has really changed. I feel like until way more people get the vaccine, we' re still in the pandemic. EOS 0 1 17 [Self-disclosure] Me too, unfortunately for us, universities don' t seem t have the same sentiments. For starters, I think it would benefit you to eliminate the more closer problems: your roommates. Have you tried talking to them?
5 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. I' m here to listen. EOS 5 0 1 The unemployment office is overwhelmed and I' m overwhelmed trying to help my family member. EOS 5 1 2 [Providing Suggestions or Information] These days all of us have this situation. I can assure you that your family can understand it. How about an online job? EOS 5 0 3 Yes, it just very frustrating. My family member has taken another restaurant job only to lose it again for the same reasons, COVID. They have been going to temp services also. EOS 5 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I also worked in a coffee house and it has been closed for this damn virus. I feel sad too. But we should go on. EOS 5 0 5 The job center' s can only help so much. And if they don' t have internet skills, then online jobs will help. EOS 5 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] This sounds good. EOS 5 0 7 So this family member gave up their apartment, moved back in with family, still fighting unemployment and going to food banks. It' s crazy. They are doing what they can but when we talk about it, it' s hard to believe in these modern times we are in such a mess. EOS 5 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I wish this virus ends soon. But believe me everyone have similar situation these days. Did they try any online job? EOS 5 0 9 No online computer skills, but they now learned where to get some basic training. EOS 5 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] This sounds good. Wish to learn soon. I am mourning for my grandpa and my uncle that they gone for the Covid. You should be happy that you have them. EOS 5 0 11 I' m so sorry. I feel a little better talking about this. My family tries to help other family members but we can only do so much. That' s when I got frustrated( helping them with unemployment) EOS 5 1 12 [Others] Money is not always a big deal honey.
3 0 0 hi there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! what seems to be bothering you today? EOS 3 0 2 currently, i am living in a house with my brother, which i co own and can not afford to move out.. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Is living with your brother a bad thing? What specifically is making you upset? EOS 3 0 4 yes it is. he acts like a azz most of the time. he dosent care about anyone but himself. just like his fiancé. he throws away the bills and expects me to pay to keep the utilities on when they are about to be disconnected. then tells me i dont contribute to the house.. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems like he would be a very difficult person to live with. And that is hard for you obviously. I' m thinking your upset because you can' t leave so you' re stuck. Is that correct?
0 0 0 Hello. My name is Spike. What is yours? Is anyone there? I feel kind of sad and rejected that no one is answering. Is this part of the task? EOS 0 1 1 [Others] oh no i' m sorry i left you waited. please tell me your problem. EOS 0 0 2 I' m trying to make money on MTurk and starting a YouTube channel. Money is a big concern for me. EOS 0 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] We are on the same boat. Do you have any other jobs? EOS 0 0 4 No. That' s my only income right now. It has led to a real crisis of self confidence to me. EOS 0 1 5 [Question] Have you considered applying for a job or trying uber drive/ eats? EOS 0 0 6 I have. But I have health conditions that would mean Covid - 19 would be very risky for me to get. So, I' m trying to work online. I' m trying to stay encouraged. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand how you feel, it' s tough not being able to work and earn much money. However, you are doing your best right now and should feel proud of yourself. EOS 0 0 8 Thanks. I appreciate that. What do you do to stay encouraged or confident? EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I try to spend more time outdoor and keep myself busy. I like to cook since it' s very relaxing and helps keep my mind concentrated.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 The season has me down. No family around. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Are you finding time to do things you enjoy by yourself? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 3 trying to work and write but lack motivation. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are feeling some lethargy in this cold season, and feel as though you have no support from your family. EOS 0 0 5 I don' t talk to anyone. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any plans to spend Christmas with family or friends? That may help to break the cycle of feeling low? EOS 0 0 7 I live in a hotel currently. No family or friends around, especially with the virus. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What do you do for work? Are you able to get out of the hotel frequently? EOS 0 0 9 I am a writer. Witht he virus it is hard to meet anyone. i am only here until next week then I have to go to Virignia. My children r all over the country. EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I agree, it is hard to spend time with people at the moment. We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted. It would be good to have something positive to look forward to. EOS 0 0 11 I try the dating sites, but they seem to far away or impersonal. Hope things are better. Just the current season ahs me down. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I can see that. Keep in touch with your family and try to think of positive, happy times you can all have together in the future. EOS 0 0 13 No verbal communication makes it hard. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Can you call them? EOS 0 0 15 I try but the loneliness is the hard part. EOS 0 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this loneliness is really getting to you and you are struggling to see a way forwards. As you are a writer could you perhaps try to make some online friends in forums? EOS 0 0 17 It is just the lack of communication. EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear you. Perhaps you could call one of your children now? See if they' d like to catch - up?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all. EOS 0 0 45 Also being far away from him sucks. EOS 0 1 46 [Question] Are you guys FaceTiming or communicating at all other than by texts? EOS 0 0 47 You are being very helpful by the way thank you. We aren' t FaceTiming. I just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it.. EOS 0 1 48 [Greeting] I' m trying my best, thank you for the input! Upset about leaving the apartment? Or was there something else that happened that weekend? EOS 0 0 49 Just leaving him. EOS 0 1 50 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you guys thought about scheduling date nights through FaceTime? EOS 0 0 51 I think he would but he hasn' t been feeling really good about his appearance lately. I asked and that' s what he told me. EOS 0 1 52 [Self-disclosure] I understand that completely, I can relate a lot. EOS 0 0 53 Same. EOS 0 1 54 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If it makes any difference, my partner and I have been doing date nights where we would dress up, put make up on and do our hair and everything as if we were going to the restaurant, and even if it is through Facetime or whenever we see each other in real life, it helps not only with our own self - esteem but also our relationship. EOS 0 0 55 That is very cute. EOS 0 1 56 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could open the discussion with your boyfriend, tell him that you have a date planned over Facetime and you want him to order his favorite dinner, take a shower, do his hair and dress up real nice. EOS 0 0 57 I don' t know if he would be open to that but I could try. He isn' t really the romantic type. EOS 0 1 58 [Question] You have been friends for a long time before getting together, you guys are comfortable with each other, right? EOS 0 0 59 Yes. EOS 0 1 60 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay well you do know him more than I do haha, so what would be his ideal date night? EOS 0 0 61 Probably just being at home. EOS 0 1 62 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hm okay, well I' m sure that if you do propose and organize something for him, even if it is not his favorite thing to do, if he sees that it would make you happy, he will at least consider it don' t you think? EOS 0 0 63 Yeah probably. Things are hard right now though. EOS 0 1 64 [Question] In other ways than financially? EOS 0 0 65 The financial things make things emotionally hard. I am one of the only people he has in his corner right now. EOS 0 1 66 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I' m sorry to hear that... it must be difficult for you to be in this position, I understand the stress and pressure. Is the pandemic the reason he is having also financial difficulties at the moment? EOS 0 0 67 Yes sort of. He was let go cause of covid. EOS 0 1 68 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sorry to hear that. Has he also been in the search for another job?
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you?
3 0 0 Hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hi there, how are you feeling? EOS 3 0 2 Not feeling good. Trying to find a job but no success. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] It' s a really hard time to be finding new work isn' t it? Are you getting unemployment or anything? EOS 3 0 4 I am getting unemployment but that is not sufficient with 6 children. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Wow that' s a lot of kids. Do you know that there are foodbanks out there which might be able to help you? EOS 3 0 6 As a single mother It' s pretty hard to go to search for food bank. I am spending most of my time in looking for a job. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are there any organisations that you could just call and explain your predicament to? EOS 3 0 8 I don' t know any as I never faced such situation before and my partner was there to support the family. Now there is no support of him. life is becoming misearable. EOS 3 1 9 [Question] Do you have friends who could help you, even with child care? EOS 3 0 10 One of my friends was really helpful. She moved to different city last month. After that I am totally shattered. EOS 3 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can imagine that that must have been traumatic. You will make new friends though. EOS 3 0 12 Life is becoming hard day by day. I am feeling guilty that I can' t feed my kids well. No one wants to do friendship with poor people. EOS 3 1 13 [Greeting] I am a poor person too and I' d be happy to be your friend. We have to stick together! EOS 3 0 14 Thank you so much for all your support. You will be a great person for sure. I would like to be your friend but I have nothing to return. EOS 3 1 15 [Self-disclosure] No need to return anything but friendship. Thanks for talking!
4 1 0 [Question] hi how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 Not good, i am very sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i' m sorry. whats making you sad? EOS 4 0 3 My friend just stopped talking to me and she won' t tell me the reason why. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] has she communicated via text or messanger? or has all communication stopped? EOS 4 0 5 She stopped communicating completely. Doesn' t even reply to me texts. EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] i' m so sorry to hear that. i had a friend do that to me right after the spring pandemic lockdown. did this happen recently? EOS 4 0 7 Yes, just this past week. How did you deal with your situation? EOS 4 1 8 [Self-disclosure] i was upset, but then after thinking about it more, i figured she just was overwhelmed with everything going on. i gave her the benefit of the doubt and texted happy birthday this summer and didn' t hear anything back. can you think of anything going on with her that might cause her to stop communicating? EOS 4 0 9 That' s too bad. I suppose that one should be able to let the other person know when you no; longer want to be friends with them. That way one can move on quickly. I am completely unaware. We haven' t had any argument of late so i am completely clueless. Wish she would just reach out. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] i can imagine it' s hard to put those feeling into words when you want to move on. EOS 4 0 11 Exactly. Do you know of any online resources that one can use to get through such situations? EOS 4 1 12 [Question] but, it' s left you feeling sad. how are things going otherwise? EOS 4 0 13 The other areas of my life are doing good. Just that the sadness is getting to me at times. EOS 4 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i don' t know of any specific resources. i' m sorry. however, its good that things are going well otherwise. how are relationships with others in your life going? i have found that I focusd on other friendships more since my friend ghosted me. EOS 4 0 15 The other relationships are good even though i' m now more wary of people because i don' t know who could leave my life at any moment without notice. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] that' s understandable but just because one person has left doesn' t mean that others will. EOS 4 0 17 Yes it doesn' t. But still, you never know who to trust anymore. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] trust is tricky. do you know brene brown? the researcher, author, TED talk researcher? EOS 4 0 19 No i don' t. Please tell me about him. EOS 4 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] She researches shame and vunerablilty. I find her very inspriring.
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Greeting] hi there. How are you? EOS 1 0 2 I am so frustrated. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] May I ask why you are feeling frustrated?
3 0 0 Hello, is someone there? EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, my name is Jonathan. May I ask who I am speaking to today? EOS 3 0 2 Hi Jonathan, I' m Keri. EOS 3 1 3 [Greeting] Hi Keri. How are you today? EOS 3 0 4 I' m feeling a little bit down today. I' ve been feeling a little bit down a lot lately. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh no. I' m sorry to hear that. What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately? EOS 3 0 6 My ex - husband is moved in with his new girlfriend. They might get married. EOS 3 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh Keri, that must feel awful. Was it a recent separation between you two? EOS 3 0 8 He started dating a few months after we split up. I don' t know if this is the only person he' s dated but I think so. He really moved on quick. Hi, are you still there? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Yeah I understand what you' re going through. I was in a similar position not too long ago. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. How does it make you feel that he' s trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours?
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday? EOS 6 0 2 I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I' m too scared to do anything about it as I don' t want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can' t help it. EOS 6 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 0 0 1 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am doing great, how about you? EOS 0 0 3 I am doing good. Can I talk to you about something? EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course you can, tell me about it:) EOS 0 0 5 I am worried that I won' t be able to complete my degree. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] Why so? EOS 0 0 7 I can' t get motivated, it doesn' t seem worth it. EOS 0 1 8 [Self-disclosure] Hey I' ve been there too, but it really helped me meditating and going out with nature to clear my mind of things. You should try it! EOS 0 0 9 What do you meditate about? EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Nothing special, just sit in my room in silence. Listen to tutorials on youtube to meditate. They get me relaxed and motivated for the day:)
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, what brings you to seek support, today? EOS 4 0 1 I am having ongoing depression. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin? EOS 4 0 3 I have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It first began a couple of weeks ago. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular?
0 1 0 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today? EOS 0 0 1 I am so stressed out because my business has suffered this year. I am very worried I may have to close and I won' t be able to pay my bills. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is really tough. a lot of people are going through that, you are not alone. what kind of business do you have?
2 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you feeling today? EOS 2 0 1 Hi. I' m feeling okayish. EOS 2 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest. EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely. I recently broke up with my girlfriend. We had been together for more than 3 years. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] What happened that made you guys break up? EOS 2 0 5 She said that she simply wasn' t in love anymore, and that she didn' t have the same feelings she did at the beginning. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have also had this situation happen to me. Maybe it just wasn' t the right timing or she had other interests.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you. EOS 3 0 1 Not doing well. I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Oh no, how long had you been together? EOS 3 0 3 we were together for 2 years. It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Wow, that' s horrible. How do you feel about it? EOS 3 0 5 I feel lost. I' m so used to her being around everyday. Now I don' t know what to do with myself without her. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year. EOS 3 0 7 Not only that, but with Covid going on I have noone i can see to talk about it. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have any family? EOS 3 0 9 Yes, i do, but they are far away. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Friends closeby? Hobbies? What kind of work do you do? EOS 3 0 11 I do have friends, who are also friends with her. However they have families and do not visit prople because of covid. I don' t have any true hobbies. I don' t think they will fill the void anyways. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow.
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. EOS 4 0 1 Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 4 1 2 [Greeting] I am good how are you. EOS 4 0 3 I am glad you are doing well, I have been struggling lately as my girlfriend that I was going to propose to broke up with me. She told me that my career path was different then hers and she just did not see it working out. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] How was your career path different? I understand how you are feeling everything will be okay. EOS 4 0 5 She had a desire to do marine biology and I wanted to pursue law enforcement as a police officer, however due to my back injury that fell through recently. She would spend most of her time doing field work, which would require her to spend time out at sea. She was working in a nursing home at the time and was not a marine biologist.. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] She did not like your career path? EOS 4 0 7 I am thinking that would be the case, however we dated for 3 years and then reconnecting about a year later which at this time was a distant relationship. She now has a boyfriend which she started date about 2 months she broke up with me. I found out that he works with her at the nursing home. I am unsure what to think, but she did say that she just didn' t see how our career paths would work out and that was that.. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right. It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after. EOS 4 0 9 I have had some friends echo that. I agree, it definitely felt like I was giving a lot through the time we dated. I have always wondered if this was a true statement, knowing her I think she probably got scared of what that entailed or just the distance. The new boyfriend was definitely a wild card, that I think has caused me to question her parting words. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don' t support your career. I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self. EOS 4 0 11 I appreciate your feedback on this,( this event for context occurred about a year ago and I have moved on from it) my support system has said the same thing. I think the difficult part is just overcoming that mental/ emotional hurdle of having the desire to marry her, which failed since it was an expectation of what was to come. I appreciate your suggestions. I think being the best" me" will help equip me for my future spouse!:). EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Right i can understand how you are feeling. We all have been in a situation where we have the desire to marry someone and all that fails. I have been in a situation like that. EOS 4 0 13 What did you do to help overcome the depression you faced or the grief of what was?. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I just had to let it go and just focus on myself because i had no choice.
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state. EOS 0 0 6 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well. EOS 0 0 8 Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing( which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all. I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out. EOS 0 0 10 What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job: it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. Working there would be ministry, not typical work. And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, that' s a big deal. i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it. EOS 0 0 12 Thank you. I believe there are three things in my favor: I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current( related) job fifteen years ago. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] even by working there, you will surely meet new friends. do you know many people from the church? EOS 0 0 14 We worked together for almost 13 years before she retired, but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer/ work partner? I know a few of the higher ups from the area churches, and a handful of families. I know half the core staff I would be working with daily and think of them as extended family.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you just have to be patient and don' t push it too hard so that you won' t look desperate. EOS 0 0 16 The benefits are nice, also, such as staff are provided meals prepared by the banquet chef and his team when at work. And though everyone has a role, the office staff support each other well and work as a team. EOS 0 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, banquet at work. that is a wonderland stuff. EOS 0 0 18 At the risk of preaching religion, I believe God may be calling me to serve there.. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is definitely a dream job. God is everywhere. just put your trust in Him. He never sleep nor slumber. EOS 0 0 20 When off duty, staff are encouraged to enjoy the facilities and mingle with guests. There is an Olympic sized pool, field games, a gymnasium, an exercise room, and if off duty, one can attend most any of the events on the campus, unless designated as a private event. EOS 0 1 21 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow! Olympic size pool. Keep praying. the job is yours. EOS 0 0 22 Because my job is to sell repeat business, it is essential that I get out and meet guests and make certain that their needs are met, but it usually comes in the form of serving snacks at intermission and saying hellos as one passes. It would feel like a family reunion, but in a family where everyone gets along. EOS 0 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] that is good, i work in such place where everyone is like a family. EOS 0 0 24 The music events year round are outstanding. They have many well known names in Christian music as well as speakers who are well worth hearing. To be able to hear these messages at no cost makes the job priceless. EOS 0 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i can feel your excitement. EOS 0 0 26 As I said to my pastor, just to work somewhere where people say thank you and ask how you are doing rather than criticize every move would be such a blessing. And since I work nights already, I am more than happy to cover the office overnight to attend to guests who have locked themselves out, or have other concerns. I used to live on site at the motel where I work now, and on my days off, all I did was make keys and walk the grounds to ensure safety. At this facility, there are beautiful benches to sit and watch the moon and stars and enjoy the sunrise or just take a moment. There are covered gazebos and a couple buildings have deep covered porches for days when it' s a bit rainy or the sun is strong. And we' re across the street from mountains and a river. The campus is simply beautiful. EOS 0 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] we are trying to make impact and survive which is what you have been doing with your current work. but sooner or later you will get your real job. EOS 0 0 28 I pray you are right. I feel as though I have been running on a hamster wheel, but it has brought me to this. Fifteen years of directly related experience, with about another 15 to 20 years of customer service, call center, and customer facing work. EOS 0 1 29 [Reflection of feelings] I hope and pray everything happens the way you wished. you have been working hard. I will put you in my prayers. EOS 0 0 30 Thank you. I don' t mind the work, but it would be nice to also have appreciation, that is what makes the current job difficult is that I feel taken for granted.. Thank you. EOS 0 1 31 [Greeting] You are welcome. Do have a nice day.
3 0 0 Hello, I' ve been really depressed lately and feel like there isn' t anything I can do to break this feeling. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me what happened? EOS 3 0 2 November before Covid started I was diagnoses with CRPS( its a nerve issue that causes immense pain) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when Covid hit last March and we all had to isolate I have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family. EOS 3 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you suffered from a nerve issue pain and not being able to do the activities you like to do before Covid. Plus Covid made u not able to social with other people. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 4 Yes that is correct. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest. EOS 3 0 6 I know I' m not alone and that' s what makes it hard to reach out, because I don' t want people to think that I think my problems are worse then there' s. It just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] I bet there are lots of people feel the same as you do. But they are afraid of sharing the negative emotion to others as you do. It seems that you don' t want to bother others. You seem a very thoughtful person. EOS 3 0 8 I just don' t know what to do about it anymore. Yes, I don' t like to bother others or let other people down. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure. Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief? Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think? EOS 3 0 10 It is a lot, I' m used to being the person that everyone comes to for help, but I am not very good at asking for help myself. I have seen a doctor and they started my new medicine regimen but unfortunately there is no cure for this disease. I was going to physical therapy but finished that right as Covid started.. Plus it does get better as the weather gets warmer so the winter has been hard, really looking forward to spring and summer for a little relief. EOS 3 1 11 [Others] I' m sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now. EOS 3 0 12 I' d be open to doing Yoga once things open back up, but having this disease puts me in a high risk category so my interaction outside the home still has to remain limited until we develop some heard immunity. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know. Sunshine is always best cure for a better mood. Did you try to maybe walk or drive around your neighborhood for some fresh air? Oh, then drive around might be the only option. EOS 3 0 14 I' m hoping to get out and go for walks once the weather warms up, unfortunately right now there is still some snow on the ground and it' s not quite warn yet being in the northeast. EOS 3 1 15 [Others] Ye. You did the right choice. Safety is always the first concern. EOS 3 0 16 I did take walks along the path in our development last summer so the cabin fever wasn' t as bad as it seems to be with all the snow that basically kept me inside all of february. EOS 3 1 17 [Question] Does where you live have a online social activity group on FB or an app called Neighbors? That could be a good way to communicate with others in a safe way. EOS 3 0 18 The local FB group is only full of everyone complaining about everyone else( seems when everyone is home things seem to get on peoples nerves more so then when people could get away from home consistently) but I' ve never heard of the app Neighbors, I' ll have to look into that. EOS 3 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Give that a try. Maybe you will meet some friends there. EOS 3 0 20 I will definitely have to look into that. EOS 3 1 21 [Greeting] Sounds great. I' m glad you didn' t give up seeking for solutions to make yourself feel better. EOS 3 0 22 Getting someone else' s perspective helps because like you recommending that app, there are things I don' t know about out there so I appreciate that. EOS 3 1 23 [Greeting] You are welcome! Glad I can help.
4 0 0 I feel sad, and feel like need help. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you identify why you feel sad? EOS 4 0 2 yes, my aunt pass away a couple weeks ago. and since then im feeling really sad. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is natural to feel sad when someone you care about dies. EOS 4 0 4 IS there something I can do to feel better? EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Are you with family? Sometimes it helps to be with others who are grieving? EOS 4 0 6 No, I live alone, my family lives in another state. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Being by yourself is rough after a death. Can you talk with your family by phone? Do you have a friend who has gone through a similar loss? EOS 4 0 8 I feel like everybody is in their own bussines and have no time to hear my complains. I talk to my family, but the whole family is not doing really fine. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you feel people think you are complaining when you talk about your Aunt' s death making you sad. Is that correct? EOS 4 0 10 yes. EOS 4 1 11 [Question] Do you feel you are complaining? EOS 4 0 12 yes, I feel like noone wants to listen. I need to do something by mnyself. Can you recommend someting for me to do to feel better? EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] My own experiences with family deaths is they are sad. I just wanted to" feel better". My experience was it did not help to complain about" being sad" but it did help to talk about why I missed my family member. If no one was available, sometimes I would journal. Do you think that might help you? EOS 4 0 14 Well maybe it could works, to mantain distracted. thank you. EOS 4 1 15 [Greeting] You are welcome. I am sorry about your Aunt. EOS 4 0 16 Thnak you, I think it helps to have someone to chat. Makes me feel better to chat a bit with you, helped me to relax. EOS 4 1 17 [Question] That is why I am here. Is there anything else you would like to chat about? EOS 4 0 18 I hink, Im fine for now. I will try to keep myself focus on different things. and try to chat a bit more at leaat with my family. EOS 4 1 19 [Question] Good bye?

EOS 0 0 2 I am really struggling with my studies at the moment, I am so anxious that I keep putting off my essays and worrying all the time. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are a student who is having trouble. Is that correct?
3 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you. EOS 3 0 1 Not doing well. I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Oh no, how long had you been together? EOS 3 0 3 we were together for 2 years. It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. EOS 3 1 4 [Question] Wow, that' s horrible. How do you feel about it? EOS 3 0 5 I feel lost. I' m so used to her being around everyday. Now I don' t know what to do with myself without her. EOS 3 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year. EOS 3 0 7 Not only that, but with Covid going on I have noone i can see to talk about it. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have any family? EOS 3 0 9 Yes, i do, but they are far away. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Friends closeby? Hobbies? What kind of work do you do? EOS 3 0 11 I do have friends, who are also friends with her. However they have families and do not visit prople because of covid. I don' t have any true hobbies. I don' t think they will fill the void anyways. EOS 3 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow. EOS 3 0 13 I do software development, but its a work at home situation. So i have been just by myself for the last week, and its driving me crazy. All i do is think about why she would do that. I' ve had time to myself but its not getting any better. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have always tried to think of things in a positive way. This way even when something really bad happens, it doesn' t seem so bad as to overwhelm us from recovering. EOS 3 0 15 What positive are there here? EOS 3 1 16 [Question] I' m actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it? Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren' t hurting for money. EOS 3 0 17 It' s ok. pays the bills. But my job is pretty independent. so i don' t even get to meet new people. I am usually home, while she was always out of the house during the day. EOS 3 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You can use that stress that has been building up to find a new outlet for the stress. EOS 3 0 19 what, you want to break stuff to relieve stress. EOS 3 1 20 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. My wife used to think I was just playing on the computer all day, lol. I run. Every morning, I jog about 2 miles. It is awesome to get the blood going and a great way to start the day. EOS 3 0 21 That sound like something i could give a try. any other seggestions? EOS 3 1 22 [Others] I feel so much more relaxed after running and it seems that nothing can hurt me after that.

EOS 2 0 4 I don' t have resume. EOS 2 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest you type one up, most employers want an application and a resume. EOS 2 0 6 I will need somebody type one for me. EOS 2 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps a friend can help you, if not they have programs on the web to help assist with that.

It will help. any other questions?
1 0 0 Hi. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello though, how has life been treating you lately? EOS 1 0 2 It' s been a pretty crazy year. I' m mostly bummed because of my work. EOS 1 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It has been a really weird year hasn' t it? Don' t worry, I think it' s been the same for all of us. Would you like to tell me more details? EOS 1 0 4 Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else' s pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss( the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That really sucks! I can understand why you are angry and anxious about this and you have every right to be!. Are there any official routes that you can use to complain?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all. EOS 0 0 45 Also being far away from him sucks. EOS 0 1 46 [Question] Are you guys FaceTiming or communicating at all other than by texts? EOS 0 0 47 You are being very helpful by the way thank you. We aren' t FaceTiming. I just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it.. EOS 0 1 48 [Greeting] I' m trying my best, thank you for the input! Upset about leaving the apartment? Or was there something else that happened that weekend? EOS 0 0 49 Just leaving him. EOS 0 1 50 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you guys thought about scheduling date nights through FaceTime?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hi. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hi, I feel really sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] I am sorry. What is going on? EOS 4 0 3 My friends won' t hang out with me. I am alone all the time. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you feel like they don' t want to be around you and have nobody to talk to? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, but also just no one to hang out with. I am a loner. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] You prefer it that way?. EOS 4 0 7 No. I want to hang out with people. EOS 4 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I follow you. It is hard to see people outside of usual social circles right now with the pandemic going on. Out of curiosity tell me what you like doing with others? EOS 4 0 9 I like to talk with them, listen to their stories, just hang out have a good time.. EOS 4 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I can understand that. I have not seem my own friends for almost a year because of COVID - 19. It felt isolated and lonely. EOS 4 0 11 What do you do to feel better? EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It has not been easy but I focused on myself. I started doing more exercise and weight lifting. I took up learning how to invest money, and I also got into the habit of reading. Basically I build myself up in body, wallet, and mind so I feel better about myself progressively. It worked well for me at least. What do you think might help you?
0 0 0 Hello. Feeling low today. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it. EOS 0 0 2 I' ve been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn' t go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint? EOS 0 0 4 Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don' t have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions. EOS 0 1 5 [Others] Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress. EOS 0 0 6 Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products. I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. Challenging face - to - face, and I have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now. What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing. EOS 0 0 8 Thanks. It helps to know that I' m not alone. Most often, I work independently my work. Involves a lot of explaining and justification. Before we just all sat in the same room and worked together. EOS 0 1 9 [Self-disclosure] My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don' t convey the meaning 100 percent. EOS 0 0 10 So, perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues? EOS 0 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would personally suggest more happy hours, in case you haven' t already done so. EOS 0 0 12 Ah, something more casual? EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Holiday care packages would also be a good common ground for folks to gather around over something that is not work. EOS 0 0 14 That' s a great idea! I would love to get a care package, actually! EOS 0 1 15 [Others] Yeah maybe also virtual meditation sessions can help concentration mind and body. It doesn' t have to be hobbies of our own, but doing it as a team virtually can bring people together and boost morale. EOS 0 0 16 Thank you! I will suggest that my organization arrange these. We can even ask all the employees to showcase their hobbies, or some such. I will pass these suggestions on! Have a great holiday season! EOS 0 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is good to hear. I am aware that the other team in my company all read a book called How to Be Antiracist. It can serve as both learning and bonding purposes. I am glad that I can be of help. Thank you again for reaching out. Hope you adjust better to the changing norm next year and happy holidays.
4 0 0 Hi there, are you free to talk? EOS 4 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how can i help you today?
0 1 0 [Question] Hello. How can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 What should I do. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Tell me about the situation that you are facing. EOS 0 0 3 I try to find a job but there is not many. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking? EOS 0 0 5 About 6 months. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand that there are a lot of job loss in the Covid time. Is your job seeking related to that? Yeah it must be very difficult. EOS 0 0 7 yes. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and I got an offer in February right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you. I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family. EOS 0 0 9 I don' t know what types of jobs that fit me. yeah, but it is still rough to get by. EOS 0 1 10 [Others] Tell me more about it if you don' t mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking? EOS 0 0 11 I worked in manufacturer. technical skill in trade school but not degree from college. EOS 0 1 12 [Others] I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position? EOS 0 0 13 I will seek for another jobs if possible but I can work on manufacturer company too. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the Covid time? EOS 0 0 15 If I can work remotely I will do it. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have been browsing job boards every now and then. There are consistently some grocery store jobs, or cashier jobs. If you don' t mind the location, I am sure you would be a good fit for these.
7 0 0 Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well. EOS 7 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well I can help you study if you' d like? EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material... EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study! EOS 7 0 4 My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted. EOS 7 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version. EOS 7 0 6 Wow, that' s actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me. EOS 7 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot. EOS 7 0 8 That is true. I will reach out to her now. EOS 7 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will do just fine, you can do it! EOS 7 0 10 I still have some self - doubt given that I have failed an exam in the past... EOS 7 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam. EOS 7 0 12 I really appreciate this advice. I am feeling better about the exam and feel like I should envision myself passing and doing well. EOS 7 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, thats the spirit it works for me! EOS 7 0 14 I will give it a try! EOS 7 1 15 [Question] Okay is there anything else I can help you with or should I let you go? EOS 7 0 16 No, I should go study now. thank you for your help. EOS 7 1 17 [Others] Of course anytime, have a goodnight!
0 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hai. EOS 0 0 1 Hey. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] How are you friend? Where are you from? EOS 0 0 3 Okay i guess. North Carolina. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] ok,
6 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 1 Hi there. Can you help me? EOS 6 1 2 [Question] What help you need? please can you explain. EOS 6 0 3 I did not study for a test and I very poorly. I feel ashamed! EOS 6 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] please don' t feel shame you can do it. nothing is hard if we try.
2 1 0 [Question] Hi there, how are we doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Okay how are you? EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Im doing great thanks. Anything on your mind today? EOS 2 0 3 Just pondering microcheating and wondering why someone who I do not like that way would be considered microcheating. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] And what do you mean by microcheating? EOS 2 0 5 It is a new thing like having a man you like that you check up on on social media even though you are in a relationship, or eating lunch with the same woman or man that you like but you don' t act on because you are married. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Oh i see, well i think overthinking things like that can lead to unwanted emotions. Or putting yourself in a situation with another person when you are in a relationship might mean there are other issues going on. EOS 2 0 7 Yes i see that. No nothing else going on just thinking that the definition maybe shouldn' t be as exact for the type of person that I do not talk to because of his reservations about it. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well, if you are not talking to them then i see no harm. If you are talking to them with some sort of intention to for a relationship beyond friendship then i see issues arising.
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:) EOS 2 0 5 Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:) EOS 2 0 7 It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I am in the UK. It' s sort of a grey area... police won' t really do anything but you can' t buy it over the counter. EOS 2 0 9 One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I' m very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially. EOS 2 1 10 [Self-disclosure] Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot. The US seems to be really strict on it tho. EOS 2 0 11 It varies, state by state, depending on which party is governing. Which you of course have a version of in the UK. Mayoral elections were today yeah? EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] They were but I didn' t pay much attention:) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that' s all. EOS 2 0 13 Oh, well, I' m sorry to hear that. I think participation in local governance is actually the most achievable path for change, but perhaps how it' s structured where you are, it wouldn' t really matter much if you participated. I guess mayorals are only technically local, not like parliamentary elections. EOS 2 1 14 [Others] If I were in London or a major city I' d vote for Mayor. I am in a rural area and we don' t have one: D. I vote for local councillors tho. EOS 2 0 15 Oh, I take it to mean that you are anti - Khan? If you feel like you' d need to vote for mayor in London. EOS 2 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I like Khan:)
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing. EOS 6 0 8 Yeah, people don' t know that just because my two friends go" Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two( so - called) friends? EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] definatly not... have you tried explaining your situation to them? EOS 6 0 10 No, they don' t know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID - 19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time? EOS 6 0 12 I might be able to do that. EOS 6 1 13 [Others] unfortunatly it is right now very comen this situation, so no shame for that, EOS 6 0 14 Well, I used to donate a LOT in year' s past. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] a lot of times donating time to help organisatiosn is more valuable then money. EOS 6 0 16 Great point. EOS 6 1 17 [Others] times and situations change so thats ok.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi my name is Sarah, how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hi, Sarah. I am at my wits end. I feel like I am going crazy. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Oh no! That sounds stressful. What' s happening? EOS 0 0 3 I am stressed out about having to move and I just can' t seem to calm down when it is time to sleep.. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] Moving is such a stressful time. When do you move?. EOS 0 0 5 I am moving in a month, but there is just so much to do before then. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. What is your wind - down routine like in the evening, if you have one? EOS 0 0 7 I usually put my kids to bed and then try to relax for about an hour while I watch tv before I head to bed. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] Oh you' re a parent AND you are moving, you have a lot on your plate! EOS 0 0 9 Yes, I am a homeschooling mother of two.. EOS 0 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried a warm bath before bed? that' s helped me before. Meditation to still my mind before sleeping helps too. I' ve read that a small carb snack before bed, like a peice of toast, is supposed to help us fall asleep, I haven' t tried it though. EOS 0 0 11 A bath does sound really relaxing. I have tried some meditations. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] One thing I highly recommend is a podcast called" Tracks to Relax". EOS 0 0 13 Thanks, I will have to try that. Music does tend to calm me down. I don' t know why I haven' t tried that. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It' s guided sleep meditations, and his voice is incredibly soothing.... works well for me on nights I can' t naturally fall asleep. He leads you relaxing walks into the forest and such things, it' s very peaceful. EOS 0 0 15 I really appreciate that help, I will try it for sure. I think it will be easier to focus on a meditation with someone talking me through it. EOS 0 1 16 [Question] Have you a partner sharing the childrearing? EOS 0 0 17 Yes, but he has already moved to our new house because he is working on floors and stuff to get it ready. So I have been alone to stew in my worries. EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Oh I see so right now you' re the main" parent - er"? Do you have other family that could take the kids for a wekend so you can have a proper rest? EOS 0 0 19 Yes, I am. But, my children are not very stressful. I think they help more than anything. I have wonderful children. I think it is just the thoughts of moving to a new place and the actual 20 hour drive in a moving truck that is scaring me. I really appreciate your support today. It is helpful to talk it out. Your suggestions were also really good. EOS 0 1 20 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You have wonderful children beccause they have been well parented by the sounds of it:) EOS 0 0 21 Thank you so much! You have a great day:) EOS 0 1 22 [Greeting] I hope your move goes smoothly.... try to make sure you carve out time for YOU... bye! EOS 0 0 23 Bye. EOS 0 1 24 [Others] ( please click the quit button)
3 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 I' m good. How about you? EOS 3 1 2 [Question] Very little to complain about today. What brings you here? EOS 3 0 3 Just want to talk some random stuff basically just want a companion. EOS 3 1 4 [Others] How' s the weather where you are? EOS 3 0 5 Still pretty cold and dry in here, how about there? EOS 3 1 6 [Question] Exactly the same. What are you doing to stay warm? EOS 3 0 7 Just in my long pajamas with heater. I don' t really know what to do anymore, I am just lazy on everything. EOS 3 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well you' re resourceful at staying warm, at least. You mentioned wanting a companion, are you living alone? EOS 3 0 9 not really I' m living with my family but I don' t really talk to them anymore I' m just in my room all day. EOS 3 1 10 [Question] Is it the stress of the pandemic getting to you& your family, or something else? EOS 3 0 11 It' s something else. EOS 3 1 12 [Question] Can you share? EOS 3 0 13 Just a fight from years ago and I decided to not talk to them anymore.. EOS 3 1 14 [Reflection of feelings] That' s completely your decision, but it can bring us down at times. What are you doing to stay positive during these crazy times in the world? I know you mentioned feeling lazy. Sometimes I make a list of things in the morning that I want to accomplish. Even if I get one done, it' s a win.: -)
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! How are you doing? EOS 0 0 1 im ok kinda stressed. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] Anything I can help with:)? Feeling stressed is never fun:( What has been making you feel stressed? EOS 0 0 3 im feeling very overwhelmed and cant get anything done cause i dont know where to start! i want to declutter my house but dont know where to start. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] I hear you, feeling overwhelmed and like you don' t know where to start can leave a person feeling stressd forsure! Decluttering sounds like a great idea! Sometimes taking baby steps is a good place to start! EOS 0 0 5 but there are so many thinggs to do and ideas i have. EOS 0 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Of course! It can feel so stressful when we have all these little things we want to do but don' t know where to start! EOS 0 0 7 should i start in one room or one group of things and collect them from all the rooms? EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What is one little area that maybe seems easier to start with? Yeah, that' s a great idea! EOS 0 0 9 well i seem to start and them i end up jumoing to another thing! jumping. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hey, well that' s okay! starting is half the battle, so that' s an accomplishment right there! EOS 0 0 11 thanx that helps cause i start feeling defeated. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried maybe using a timer or making a list to help keep you focused on decluttering one area at a time? Of course! It' s easy to be hard on ourselves, but just the fact that you are trying is so important! EOS 0 0 13 u know what i bought a timer and it came in today! hopefully it will help! EOS 0 1 14 [Others] Oh awesome! I am so glad! Maybe trying that out could be useful! EOS 0 0 15 i have no type of supportin my life and it really does effect me. thanx for all your positively. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Having no support is so hard:( Especially during these times! EOS 0 0 17 im gonna start again tomorrow with more faith in myself.

3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hi, how are you feeling today? EOS 3 0 2 I am not feeling the best. I have been having some depression, because of not being able to see friends and family during this pandemic. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Oh, boy, do I know that feeling! How are you dealing with it?( if I may ask) EOS 3 0 4 I try to message them as much as possible and call them on the phone but it is just not the same as actually getting to give the a hug and see them in person. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] I know that. I use Zoom, just to see them... do you have a computer? EOS 3 0 6 Yes. That works for some of my family but I have family in the nursing home that does not have access to computers. I haven' t seen them in several months. It just breaks my heart. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh. I can feel it. I have someone who' s sick as well. Do you have any one friend with whom you can share your feelings, your depression. I understand you' re having issues with depression, right? It sometimes helps me to feel that we' re all in this together. And, at the other end of this, we will be able to give the biggest hugs ever! EOS 3 0 8 Yes. I have some very dear friends that have helped me a lot. I guess the depression is just worse because it is the holidays and this is the first year that I haven' t got to spend it with my extended family members. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] Oh.... That' s so tough... it being the first year!!!! Sometimes, I cry( I cry with my cat), and just to say the feelings out loud makes me feel a bit better. EOS 3 0 10 Yeah. I have a little dog that has been my cuddle buddy. I have had him for 13 years so he has seen me ugly cry many times. What are some things you do to deal with depression? EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I try to read, watch programs or podcasts that take away my negativity. Anything that will give me a lift, so that my own depression won' t get so bad that I can' t remember what it felt like to be a bit happy. EOS 3 0 12 That sounds like some good advice. I think I will try to find a good podcast or a good comedy series that I like and spend time doing that. It' s hard to be sad when you are watching something funny or listening to something funny. Thank you for the good advice and the listening ear. EOS 3 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] I wish that I could listen to more.... this thing is so slow. Remember, we' re all in this together, and we will come out the other end. Isn' t it OK to be happy a bit, even though this takes such a toll on so many people? EOS 3 0 14 That is so true. I guess we tend to feel guilty if we feel happy since there is so much sadness in the world right now. But you are so right about the fact that we will come out on the other side. It helps to remember that bad things don' t last forever. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, and are you somewhere where you can walk or exercise a bit? I always feel better if I can move around... dance... something active. What I find helps me the most is to remember that we need to stay safe and be OK, so that we will be here to celebrate when this is over.
4 1 0 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello, How are you today. EOS 4 0 1 I' m really depressed. My fiance left me yesterday. EOS 4 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it? EOS 4 0 3 Yes, I think that might make me feel better. I really have no one to talk to because my family and friends didn' t like him so they think this is for the best. EOS 4 1 4 [Greeting] Ok. I am happy to listen.. EOS 4 0 5 I just don' t understand why someone would pretend to be happy for a year and then decide they were lying and leave. EOS 4 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Seems like you feel your partner betrayed you, does that sound right?. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I feel very betrayed.. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is understandable. I know how you feel, may I suggest taking a few minutes to clear your head, and making a plan to talk with your friends and parents about how you feel? EOS 4 0 9 They think I should just get over it because they didn' t like him so they think I shouldn' t like him either. They' re making things worse for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] Oh I' m so sorry, sometimes family and friends don' t think about your feelings. When did this happen? EOS 4 0 11 He left yesterday. I had no warning. He just packed up all his stuff and said he didn' t want to marry me and the last year has been a lie. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Dang. he seems very selfish. But I understand how up setting it must have felt. My first husband left me without warning.
4 0 0 I face the situation of me being sad because I thought we could let this fight go over time but instead it has lead to us breaking up. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about the fight? EOS 4 0 2 Yes, so we had a fight previously over Thanksgiving Break about how I woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. Then I pick her up to go try and get breakfast... then she starts punching me while I drive so I pull over. Then she keeps hitting me until I tell her to stop. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple. Is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else? EOS 4 0 4 It is because I do really miss her. I really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Breakups are hard, but it sounds like she was violent. EOS 4 0 6 Yeah she was a little violent. I was honestly a little scared for my life for a second but people make mistakes. EOS 4 1 7 [Question] Have you talked since then? EOS 4 0 8 We have talked a little bit before hand this month. It was okay but I am still sad about what happened. She was very open to talking and such but I just wasn' t ready because my family found out about what happened and are worried about my safety. EOS 4 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If safety is an issue, then I think that maybe moving on is a good decision. EOS 4 0 10 I know but I am so sad because the break up was so quick and we did not really have closure after the whole fight happened between us. I still keep on thinking about her. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. Don' t be in a hurry to get into a new relationship, but if one happens that would be great too. Is this your first breakup? EOS 4 0 12 I will definitely try to get over her using those techniques you just said. It' s way harder to do than say though. No, this is not my first breakup with a woman but I felt like she was the one for me. EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] Breakups are not always the end, but they usually happen for a reason, and whenever violence is involved it is usually better to move on. EOS 4 0 14 Maybe you' re right! Just need to get productive and get my mind off of her for good since she was violent. EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest you start trying to have fun with others and getting yourself out there where there will be new opportunities. EOS 4 0 16 I will definitely try. I know it will be hard because I am upset still but sometimes I guess moving on is the only thing that you can do in this situation. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The sadness will eventually pass and I am sure there is someone out there that will be a good match for you.
0 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 0 0 1 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I am doing great, how about you? EOS 0 0 3 I am doing good. Can I talk to you about something? EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course you can, tell me about it:)
0 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling today? EOS 0 0 1 The season has me down. No family around. EOS 0 1 2 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. Are you finding time to do things you enjoy by yourself? Any hobbies? EOS 0 0 3 trying to work and write but lack motivation. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you are feeling some lethargy in this cold season, and feel as though you have no support from your family. EOS 0 0 5 I don' t talk to anyone. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any plans to spend Christmas with family or friends? That may help to break the cycle of feeling low? EOS 0 0 7 I live in a hotel currently. No family or friends around, especially with the virus. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] What do you do for work? Are you able to get out of the hotel frequently? EOS 0 0 9 I am a writer. Witht he virus it is hard to meet anyone. i am only here until next week then I have to go to Virignia. My children r all over the country. EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I agree, it is hard to spend time with people at the moment. We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted. It would be good to have something positive to look forward to. EOS 0 0 11 I try the dating sites, but they seem to far away or impersonal. Hope things are better. Just the current season ahs me down. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, I can see that. Keep in touch with your family and try to think of positive, happy times you can all have together in the future. EOS 0 0 13 No verbal communication makes it hard. EOS 0 1 14 [Question] Can you call them? EOS 0 0 15 I try but the loneliness is the hard part. EOS 0 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like this loneliness is really getting to you and you are struggling to see a way forwards. As you are a writer could you perhaps try to make some online friends in forums? EOS 0 0 17 It is just the lack of communication. EOS 0 1 18 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I hear you. Perhaps you could call one of your children now? See if they' d like to catch - up? EOS 0 0 19 without any communication it makes it seem like a battle alone. My daughter is busy and 3 hours away. different time zones amke it hard. EOS 0 1 20 [Self-disclosure] Maybe schedule in a call with her for the future? I have been making time to speak with my family every Tuesday, it gives us something to look forward to each week. EOS 0 0 21 Children can only share so much. I chat with her, but the timing is off. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] What are your plans in Virginia? EOS 0 0 23 Find a place to live for awhile. I have to take care of a legal matter. EOS 0 1 24 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well that sounds as though it will give you something to focus on. EOS 0 0 25 I just want a person to chat with that we can share with each other. Children r ok to chat with but lack of a female to spend time with is hard. EOS 0 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Perhaps once you get to Virginia you could seek out some groups or activities to find some new friends. EOS 0 0 27 Unfortunately the virus stopping people. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is very hard at the moment. But things will improve, keep communication with your family for now and when the time is right in Virginia you can start to look for new friends to spend time with in your new home. EOS 0 0 29 Ok well thanks for the chat. I will let you go. Be Blessed. EOS 0 1 30 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Keep your head up, these sad days will pass.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I' m a little bummed because my friend is not only a junkie but he got arrested last week. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ouch! Your friend got arrested for drugs last week? EOS 3 0 3 He got arrested for stealing to fund his addiction. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I had a neighbor who was doing meth, and he got arrested, and that actually saved his life. He had to get sober and look at what he was doing. There is a hard line between helping a friend who is addicted and actually enabling them. Have you ever heard of this? EOS 3 0 5 Sadly my friend has been arrested a few times, spent time in prison, and is fully locked in his lifestyle. He' s such a great person, very funny, nice, but he is lost. EOS 3 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It can be very hard to watch a loved one destroy their lives. Has anyone every discussed an intervention? EOS 3 0 7 He has alienated all of his friends, including me. I was the last one holding on. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] My husband and I actually have worked with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. We are retired now, but still volunteer. Sometimes we have to let go of our loved ones - they have to hit rock bottom. Very hard to do, but unless they see their behavior as destructive, they don' t want to change. EOS 3 0 9 I agree, I' m afraid that' s what I have to do. Another one of our mutual friends passed away recently to an overdose. I don' t want to lose another friend. EOS 3 1 10 [Others] Have you seen the serenity prayer? Knowing what to do, what not to do and accepting life really is a great thing to ask God for. We can' t change others. Yet you have to find a way to have peace. EOS 3 0 11 Yes. I know I have to let go. I' ve punished myself trying to stay in his life. EOS 3 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] It' s very hard to lose friends to addictions. It' s epidemic in our society now. However, you can pray for them and look for ways to keep your life on track so you don' t get lost focusing on them and not where you want to go. EOS 3 0 13 all drugs are bad, but meth is a truly evil drug. It' s just rotting his soul and body. He believes he can' t stop and you' re right, letting go and just sending prayers is all i can really do now. EOS 3 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] very evil, I agree, I like to write out a list of things I can do to distract myself from overly being concerned, if that makes sense. Like I take time to think about them and pray for them, then I have to move on with my life, so a list helps me think of where I want to go and how to get there. Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol. My husband just got me a daytimer, and I write my goals in that for the new year, and I try to check it every day and try to focus on moving forward, because life has a way of throwing us curveballs like this, and we can' t get stuck in them. EOS 3 0 15 That' s a good idea. I don' t have many friends left, close friends that is, and this guy is my best friend of 20 years. We were in a touring rock band together. He' s my last close friend. EOS 3 1 16 [Reflection of feelings] It is hard to lose friends that we have had for years. Maybe you can write that on your list - - perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class, join a gym, take a dance class, volunteer at church, something like that. That way you open up yourself to make new friends. I have had to walk away from many unhealthy relationships over the years, it isn' t easy, but it' s part of maturing in life. EOS 3 0 17 I' m a single dad so my world is my children. I guess that' s enough for me really. I just watch this guy sink and often feel like I should be doing something, but I think you' re right. EOS 3 1 18 [Self-disclosure] I' ve learned the hard way, if a person doesn' t want to change, I' m just beating my head against a wall. I can pray, then leave the rest to God. It seems like a lesson I learn over and over again! Hahah.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that? EOS 0 0 21 being on the board gives me perks. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit? EOS 0 0 23 yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there' s an element of mutual manipulation. EOS 0 0 25 yes. EOS 0 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are definitely not the only person to feel this way! EOS 0 0 27 it' s a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power.. what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board. EOS 0 0 29 i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment. EOS 0 1 30 [Reflection of feelings] But that is rather manipulative of you.
1 0 0 I am so mad that I can' t see straight. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello! What is on your mind today? Oh really? Why is that? EOS 1 0 2 Well, my boyfriend has cheated so many times that I cant count them. I then meet someone nice and cheat on him once and now he breaks up with me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] being mad that your boyfriend cheated is normal. being mad when dumped is normal. don' t you think you DESERVE better than he was treating you? EOS 1 0 4 Thank you! I can see that I am talking to someone who understands. I am wondering if I should beg him back?? I really do love him. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve been there too. Expecially with covid, it can be hard realiing you may be alone and it may be frusterating dating someone new. if you really love someone, shouldnt they love you back? did his actions show love? EOS 1 0 6 Yeah, and we have been together since high school so it is really hard to think of ever marrying anyone else. He asked me to marry him but we never made it official or got rings. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak. i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart. EOS 1 0 8 He told me he never wants kids with me but acts like he would have them someday, somehow? I think you' re right. EOS 1 1 9 [Self-disclosure] i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter. trust me, its not worth it in the long run. maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you! EOS 1 0 10 Noway! That is my worst nightmare, I am so sorry. That is a real eye opener for me/ That is exactly what I don' t think I could handle. I just am in the worst cycle ever and don' t have any friends to turn to or anybody who wants to listen to the drama. I think I have wasted a lot of my life and I can' t ever get the time back that I have invested in him. EOS 1 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i think a lot of couples are feeling stuck with covid. once things open up and everyone is vaccinated and get togethers happen again, i bet there will be a LOT more breakups and a lot more options out there! all we can do is learn from our mistakes and not let the past repeat itself. EOS 1 0 12 Yeah, I can see your point. It is nice being able to vent to you and feel like I am being heard. I never got that in my relationship with him. I need to learn from the past this time and stop repeating it. EOS 1 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] with your newly aquired free time, you can focus on you! start a new hobby, dye your hair, do something you always wanted to do! EOS 1 0 14 I haven' t even had the time to get myself cute and fixed up in forever! I love that idea! I need to get my haircut. EOS 1 1 15 [Question] know what the best part is? EOS 1 0 16 No, I have idea? EOS 1 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] get yourself fixed up and cute, and find a hot new guy. your ex will see on social media and know he messed up and see you happy. its quite theraputic: D EOS 1 0 18 HAHA!! YES!! I was thinking the exact same thing! The best revenge is moving on and looking good and with somebody hot! EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] EXACTLY! You deserve so much better! Make yourself feel like it and everyone see it!: D: D. EOS 1 0 20 Sounds great! I am revived and am going to schedule a spa day and reinvent myself! Out with the old! Thank you for your encouragement today. I am going to move on from this mess and make my life better. Thanks again! EOS 1 1 21 [Others] Good luck!
2 0 0 Hey. I am really scared about my job prospects. I am really fearful about my job situation. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] When did this fear start? EOS 2 0 2 It has been a while. I have had fears going back to my childhood traumas. I think that the work situation has only exacerbated that. The current economic climate has really made me fearful.... not sure if I am going to be able to keep my job. EOS 2 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct? EOS 2 0 4 Somewhat. But, my fears are relevant because I don' t know if I will always have a job. EOS 2 1 5 [Question] Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job? EOS 2 0 6 Do you know what I mean? What say u? I have some, but they have their own problems to deal with. Everyone has problems. Do you know what I mean? EOS 2 1 7 [Self-disclosure] You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me. EOS 2 0 8 It is making me have flashbacks of other traumatic situations, I think I need to find a good support chain, for sure. What say u? You take alooonnng time to respond. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many counselors who specialize in this field of job security and especially during this pandemic and the falling economy, they are great support systems. EOS 2 0 10 I am having a hard time.... Ok, I will look some of them online. I need some financial planners to help as well. Many Americans are hurting. EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic. EOS 2 0 12 Any other advices? What else can you advise me on? Should I look elsewhere for jobs? I will have to try that. Maybe it can help me ease my mind. EOS 2 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Since a lot of this stress is being caused by your childhood trauma, it seems like there is something that connects that job to your trauma and if it cant be disconnected, it seems like you should find another job. And I understand that is not the easiest in these times but I believe you can do it! EOS 2 0 14 It is not easy right now. That' s for sure.. I am wondering if I could do Lyft or Uber. I think a side hustle could work, perhaps? EOS 2 1 15 [Question] Do you think those jobs would help you disconnect your childhood trauma and work life? EOS 2 0 16 Do you think I am thinking rationally? I could give it a try.... Childhood traumas are tough for sure. I am a fearful person. EOS 2 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Just giving it a try is what starts every journey and I am proud of you for taking that leap!
6 1 0 [Question] hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 1 Hi there. Can you help me? EOS 6 1 2 [Question] What help you need? please can you explain. EOS 6 0 3 I did not study for a test and I very poorly. I feel ashamed! EOS 6 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] please don' t feel shame you can do it. nothing is hard if we try. EOS 6 0 5 Exactly. I did not try! EOS 6 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] so please try then you feel better. where you feel stuck in studies please can you explain. EOS 6 0 7 I just don' t feel motivated to study. EOS 6 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] from today please feel yourself that you know everything about your studies, i think then you fell better. EOS 6 0 9 ok I will do that. Thank you. EOS 6 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] give more time to your study then you know everything about your studies.
0 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I am good, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m doing well, but it could have been better. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] What seems to be bothering you tonight?
3 1 0 [Question] Good day, how are you doing? EOS 3 0 1 Not too well. I have been depessed because of our state shut down and today an old friend from unior high school passed. EOS 3 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Sorry to hear that. I absolutely understand, it' s been hard on most people having to deal with the current state of affairs and losing people.. Do you think things will improve? EOS 3 0 3 Thank you. I know we are all in the same predicament.. I think things will improve, but not for a year or more.. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I agree. I lost a teacher some time ago and I' ve been thinking a lot about when things might improve. A year seems plausible. Since it' s so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up? EOS 3 0 5 A year is a long time when y. A year is a long time when you are 76 years old. I just want to enjoy the rest of our lives - my husband and me - and travel until we can' t enjoy it any longer. EOS 3 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Sorry to hear that. It is really tough being restricted to not travelling. I call my parents( around your age) about once a week. EOS 3 0 7 Thank you so much for your support. It is tough and there is nothing to do. EOS 3 1 8 [Question] Do you have family you can talk to? Have you considered volunteering? I ask because my neighbor bakes for the local food bank and it helps her.
4 0 0 I just lost my job and am worried about paying the bills. EOS 4 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills. EOS 4 0 2 There is just too much pressure, but I have to succeed. EOS 4 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is hard having so much pressure but I think you will be able to soon get employed again. EOS 4 0 4 I am trying. I' ve started looking online for new positions but it is a process. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise. EOS 4 0 6 I just still am continually nervous and having a hard time coping. EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes deep breaths help people calm down. Have you tried that at all? EOS 4 0 8 I haven' t but maybe that will help me stay calmer. EOS 4 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] That can sometimes help you to regain your focus and be able to do more for yourself.
4 0 0 I face the situation of me being sad because I thought we could let this fight go over time but instead it has lead to us breaking up. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about the fight? EOS 4 0 2 Yes, so we had a fight previously over Thanksgiving Break about how I woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. Then I pick her up to go try and get breakfast... then she starts punching me while I drive so I pull over. Then she keeps hitting me until I tell her to stop. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] Breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple. Is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else? EOS 4 0 4 It is because I do really miss her. I really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Breakups are hard, but it sounds like she was violent.
4 1 0 [Question] Good evening. What would you like to talk about? EOS 4 0 1 evening. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] How are you feeling at the moment? EOS 4 0 3 i lost those books, I cannot even explain, how it happen. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you have lost some books? Were they important to you? EOS 4 0 5 I price one of the books, Amazon said 1000. yes. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] So you have lost a book that is worth a thousand dollars? I can imagine you are feeling really bad about that. EOS 4 0 7 where will I g et almost 3 thousand dollars. It is too painful. EOS 4 1 8 [Question] I do not know.. have you considered taking an extra job on the side? EOS 4 0 9 yes, i do. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried to get help with finding the books? Someone could have handed them in. EOS 4 0 11 school, should just give me enough time to find the books. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] Do you have any idea of where you lost them? EOS 4 0 13 allow me to clear myself later, it is a fucking thing. EOS 4 1 14 [Others] I am sorry, I do not understand what you mean. EOS 4 0 15 I am trying to find that out, I packed them inside one bag, may be someone carried the bag or I misplace them. EOS 4 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Try not to worry, it is entirely possible that someone has found them and handed them in to the authorities. You might still get them back! EOS 4 0 17 i need enough time to look for the books, but school is not ready to listen to me. EOS 4 1 18 [Question] That is really not fair of them. Is there a higher authority you can take your case to? EOS 4 0 19 you are right. EOS 4 1 20 [Self-disclosure] They really should be doing more to help you. I know how frustrating it feels to lose something valuable. I did lose a really expensive ring one time but I got it back a week later. EOS 4 0 21 yes, it is fuck giving me headache. EOS 4 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand why it would be! Please try not to worry, all is not lost. EOS 4 0 23 I just need time, I will check the CCTV of my room, and check around. EOS 4 1 24 [Greeting] That is a good idea. I hope that they have not been deliberately stolen. EOS 4 0 25 I guest so. EOS 4 1 26 [Question] Well, I hope that I have been able to offer some useful suggestions. Do you feel a bit better about things now? EOS 4 0 27 yes. EOS 4 1 28 [Greeting] Thank you for talking and enjoy your day!
0 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I am good, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m doing well, but it could have been better. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] What seems to be bothering you tonight? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, my boy friend of 3 years has refused to take our relationship to the next level and I' m kind of getting tired, I don' t want to play games anymore. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don' t feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,. EOS 0 0 6 exactly, I hate to feel that I' m wasting my time. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand that, as I was in a long term relationship and I felt as though my girlfriend at the time did not want to take things to the next step and I was not happy about it.. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I love him so dearly to want to settle down with him, but if he doesn' t want that for me I would rather call it quits now than continue and be disappointed at the long run.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you had that conversation with him? I know it might be a difficult conversation to have, but it is often good to get expectations out in the open so you are on the same page with your partner.. EOS 0 0 10 Yes, sort of and he gave me the impression that he is not there yet and that was a like almost a year ago, I don' t want it to look like I' m pushing him if I try to talk to him again about it. His nonchalant attitude in not seeing the seriousness of it is killing me, I' m just not happy. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] That is tough, but sometimes people just portray things differently, for instance I am also very laid back and nonchalant about most things which can lead to miscommunications.. I don' t think it would be pushing if you haven' t had that conversation in almost a year. EOS 0 0 12 I hope you are right, just don' t want to come across as a desperate person and that' s why I' m setting myself up to call it quits if he tries to sound like he sounded the last time. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You need to know where he is so you can make a good decision for yourself! I know it is difficult, but I know you can get through it! EOS 0 0 14 You are right, that' s exactly what I' m going to do because the wait is killing me. EOS 0 1 15 [Others] Good, I am happy for you!
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you doing and how was your night? EOS 0 0 2 It' s been tough. I' ve been looking for a job for months, but feel like I' m getting nowhere. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now. EOS 0 0 4 Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state. EOS 0 0 6 I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well. EOS 0 0 8 Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing( which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all. I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out. EOS 0 0 10 What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job: it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. Working there would be ministry, not typical work. And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] wow, that' s a big deal. i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it. EOS 0 0 12 Thank you. I believe there are three things in my favor: I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current( related) job fifteen years ago. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] even by working there, you will surely meet new friends. do you know many people from the church? EOS 0 0 14 We worked together for almost 13 years before she retired, but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer/ work partner? I know a few of the higher ups from the area churches, and a handful of families. I know half the core staff I would be working with daily and think of them as extended family.. EOS 0 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you just have to be patient and don' t push it too hard so that you won' t look desperate. EOS 0 0 16 The benefits are nice, also, such as staff are provided meals prepared by the banquet chef and his team when at work. And though everyone has a role, the office staff support each other well and work as a team. EOS 0 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow, banquet at work. that is a wonderland stuff. EOS 0 0 18 At the risk of preaching religion, I believe God may be calling me to serve there.. EOS 0 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is definitely a dream job. God is everywhere. just put your trust in Him. He never sleep nor slumber. EOS 0 0 20 When off duty, staff are encouraged to enjoy the facilities and mingle with guests. There is an Olympic sized pool, field games, a gymnasium, an exercise room, and if off duty, one can attend most any of the events on the campus, unless designated as a private event. EOS 0 1 21 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] wow! Olympic size pool. Keep praying. the job is yours. EOS 0 0 22 Because my job is to sell repeat business, it is essential that I get out and meet guests and make certain that their needs are met, but it usually comes in the form of serving snacks at intermission and saying hellos as one passes. It would feel like a family reunion, but in a family where everyone gets along. EOS 0 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] that is good, i work in such place where everyone is like a family. EOS 0 0 24 The music events year round are outstanding. They have many well known names in Christian music as well as speakers who are well worth hearing. To be able to hear these messages at no cost makes the job priceless. EOS 0 1 25 [Affirmation and Reassurance] i can feel your excitement. EOS 0 0 26 As I said to my pastor, just to work somewhere where people say thank you and ask how you are doing rather than criticize every move would be such a blessing. And since I work nights already, I am more than happy to cover the office overnight to attend to guests who have locked themselves out, or have other concerns. I used to live on site at the motel where I work now, and on my days off, all I did was make keys and walk the grounds to ensure safety. At this facility, there are beautiful benches to sit and watch the moon and stars and enjoy the sunrise or just take a moment. There are covered gazebos and a couple buildings have deep covered porches for days when it' s a bit rainy or the sun is strong. And we' re across the street from mountains and a river. The campus is simply beautiful. EOS 0 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] we are trying to make impact and survive which is what you have been doing with your current work. but sooner or later you will get your real job.
1 0 0 My boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] Hello there, how are you?. EOS 1 0 2 I' m very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. EOS 1 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. EOS 1 0 4 Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree. He said I was worthless. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! EOS 1 0 6 Well that' s good for you, but I' m so mad right now I can' t see straight! EOS 1 1 7 [Others] Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. EOS 1 0 8 I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? EOS 1 0 10 More than a year, but I' ve known him since childhood. That' s what makes me so mad! EOS 1 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long! EOS 1 0 12 All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? EOS 1 1 13 [Others] I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better. EOS 1 0 14 But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! EOS 1 1 15 [Others] Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class.. that was a great way to meet new people. EOS 1 0 20 I' m not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. EOS 1 1 21 [Others] There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? EOS 1 0 22 He' s a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly.
3 0 0 hi there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! what seems to be bothering you today? EOS 3 0 2 currently, i am living in a house with my brother, which i co own and can not afford to move out.. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Is living with your brother a bad thing? What specifically is making you upset? EOS 3 0 4 yes it is. he acts like a azz most of the time. he dosent care about anyone but himself. just like his fiancé. he throws away the bills and expects me to pay to keep the utilities on when they are about to be disconnected. then tells me i dont contribute to the house.. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems like he would be a very difficult person to live with. And that is hard for you obviously. I' m thinking your upset because you can' t leave so you' re stuck. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 6 yes, felling very stuck.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s completely normal to feel that way. I' m sure you' re handling the situation as best as you can. What have you done to try and help the situation? EOS 3 0 8 trying to, looking for every way possible to make money and save it up and move out. really dont want to have to partition the property as its the house we grew up in.. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I would feel the same way if that' s a house I grew up in. I' m so sorry! EOS 3 0 10 i tried to talk to him, in his mind its all my fault he cant pay the bills he had before i moved in. i had been living in california for the last few years, but came back with corona virus on the rise there.. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If he' s in a certain mindset, it would be hard to change that. Do you have people to talk to about this? It sounds like a lot to handle. EOS 3 0 12 right? and his fiancé is the same way, they are both alcoholics and spend most of their income on their habits. its all i can do right now to keep food in the house, let alone running water.. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think it would be good for you to talk to someone and get help. Right now, all you can do is keep chugging along and trying your best to stay afloat. EOS 3 0 14 i have a couple of friends that i have talked to about it, but it just seems like i am screaming at a brick wall and nothing changes.. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would suggest talking to a therapist if your insurance can handle that! Talking with them can help you figure out what you should do. EOS 3 0 16 honestly, i think its him that needs the therapist. he is clearly bi polar like my father was, and dosent want to admit to it. several people have tried to talk to him about it but he just denies it and goes to the other room. i know what a the therapist will tell me, that i need to either resolve the conflict or try and move out, hard to do with the epidemic going on and a lack of funds to do it.. is it normal to always feel helpless? cause thats how its been. either rip everything to shreds or do nothing.. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] Yes it is. Especially now. I just want to encourage to keep pushing. Think about yourself in a year or two from now. Do everything you can right now to get out of the situation. If it gets really bad, don' t be afraid to call out for help( like the police). Stay safe and do what' s best for you. You' ve got this! EOS 3 0 18 police are a very bad idea where i live. they will not prosecute family violence without also prosecuting me. i live in texas, if i press charges, the state will press charges against me. i have several scars from incidents where they told me as such. its really a loosing battle where the law is concerned here.. EOS 3 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] oh wow that' s terrible. that must be so stressful for you.
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot.

EOS 1 0 16 How did you get through it? EOS 1 1 17 [Question] They all took his side? Not one took yours? EOS 1 0 18 Not one! EOS 1 1 19 [Self-disclosure] I tried to find some new interests.

EOS 1 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly. EOS 1 0 24 But maybe I deserved it. EOS 1 1 25 [Others] he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly. EOS 1 0 26 Yes, he did. EOS 1 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] No you did not! Please don' t think like that. EOS 1 0 28 I' m just so angry that I could break something. And maybe I will do that! EOS 1 1 29 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this. EOS 1 0 30 But what if it doesn' t pass? And I cannot afford therapy. EOS 1 1 31 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think you really need to take it one day at a time. Things are very raw for you right now. There are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free. EOS 1 0 32 I don' t know if I could do that. I don' t like talking about my problems with strangers. EOS 1 1 33 [Self-disclosure] And yet here we are: P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found.. I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that I was. EOS 1 0 34 Do you have any suggestions about how to open up to people I don' t know? EOS 1 1 35 [Others] I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No - one will be judging you. EOS 1 0 36 That' s what I am afraid of. Being judged by people. EOS 1 1 37 [Question] Do you think that this might partly because your ex has eroded your self esteem?. EOS 1 0 38 Probably. He called me a lot of names. EOS 1 1 39 [Others] The important thing is to gradually rebuild your self esteem. Do you have any things that you excel at?. EOS 1 0 40 I' m good at bowling. And I like riding horses. EOS 1 1 41 [Others] Animals are a wonderful source of comfort when we are feeling very low! Could you join a riding club to make some new friends? EOS 1 0 42 Maybe I will do that. Horses are so cool. EOS 1 1 43 [Reflection of feelings] I can feel that you are starting to make progress already and are thinking of things that you can do post break up.
0 1 0 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today? EOS 0 0 1 I am so stressed out because my business has suffered this year. I am very worried I may have to close and I won' t be able to pay my bills. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is really tough. a lot of people are going through that, you are not alone. what kind of business do you have? EOS 0 0 3 I sell cosmetics. I think a lot of people don' t have money to buy non essential items right now. EOS 0 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] christmas is right around the corner though, and it is almost the 15th. military get paid the 1st and 15th so there is still hope for a christmas rush! tax season is right around the corner too... there is defineately still reason to keep hope. EOS 0 0 5 That might be true. I just don' t know that business will ever recover. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you online or in store? EOS 0 0 7 Mostly online. EOS 0 1 8 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] thats great then, online businesses are less likely to fail. you know, i am in construction and there are soo many zoom meetings. honestly, i was in an office with 4 people and hardly wore make up. now with all these meetings i amd doing meetings constantly and i have had to start wearing more make up to look more profesional. i know it can be scry, but you ust have to keep a positive attitude. EOS 0 0 9 Yeah we don' t have to shut down. But with so many people struggling to make ends meet, there just doesn' t seem to be enough left over to buy extra things. and that' s true. There are people on zooms that want to wear makeup. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] also, i think it depends on where you are in the world. covid hit my area really hard around april/ may, but things are completely back to normal now. people hardly wear masks, stores are open, it just takes time. EOS 0 0 11 That' s definitely not the case here. But I can see what you mean. EOS 0 1 12 [Others] maybe you could distritubute samples to hospitals for the nurses as a christmas present. put your card in. you KNOW they have job stability and it could lead to sales! EOS 0 0 13 That' s something to think about. EOS 0 1 14 [Others] if you have a facebook page you can always make a post saying you are giving back to the community by giving the essential workers chrismas gifts.... it could make people in your community want to support you back!
1 0 0 Hello. EOS 1 1 1 [Greeting] hi there. How are you? EOS 1 0 2 I am so frustrated. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] May I ask why you are feeling frustrated? EOS 1 0 4 Yes, my school was closed without warning because of COVID. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand how that could make you so frustrated, that would make me frustrated too. I am waiting to hear about my school. EOS 1 0 6 Yes I don' t even know what is going to happen with finals now. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure that whatever happens, you will do well with them. Have you thought about talking to an administrator at your school? EOS 1 0 8 I hope so. But I feel like this could have been handled better. Not yet, there is a waiting list to talk to an academic advisor. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is all the more reason to be frustrated, i commend you for having to deal with that! EOS 1 0 10 Thanks. I feel like my head is going to explode though. The remainder of the semester is going to be online. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about talking to a close friend or someone you trust about these stressors? EOS 1 0 12 Yes, I talked with my friend about it and she said don' t worry. But I can' t help it. EOS 1 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand why are you are worried though, that is a lot honestly. EOS 1 0 14 I was doing so well in my classes too. Very close to graduating. EOS 1 1 15 [Question] Do you think that your grades will go down with the switch to online? EOS 1 0 16 Yes, I don' t do well with online learning. EOS 1 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have seen that be the case for many people. Hopefully your professors will be understanding with the switch. EOS 1 0 18 I hope so too. EOS 1 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well I really hope that everything goes well for you! You sound like you are prepared. EOS 1 0 20 Thank you and thanks for letting me confide in you. It' s a weird and sad time these days. EOS 1 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] of course! I hope the rest of your year goes well. EOS 1 0 22 Thank you so much. And I hope all is well by you too. EOS 1 1 23 [Greeting] Thank you!
0 0 0 Hi. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] hello, how are you feeling? EOS 0 0 2 I am okay. Thank you. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] i' m okay too. EOS 0 0 4 Thats good. Do you have plans for the holidays? EOS 0 1 5 [Others] not really, i will probably just relax. what about you? EOS 0 0 6 Just hanging out at home with my husband and son. EOS 0 1 7 [Others] how' s your relationship with your family? EOS 0 0 8 It is pretty good. We all get along good. No issues. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] glad to hear so! EOS 0 0 10 How is your relationship with your family? EOS 0 1 11 [Others] it' s overly alright but i don' t really get along with my father.
0 1 0 [Question] hello how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hello I am taking a break from my studies to talk. I am fine thanks. Hope you are doing well also. I am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines. EOS 0 1 2 [Self-disclosure] i am fine thanks for asking. EOS 0 0 3 two exams and two assignments due at the end of this and next month. that' s good. EOS 0 1 4 [Others] Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful. EOS 0 0 5 yeah I have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it' s online and basically I do things on my own time.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you taking a lot of courses? EOS 0 0 7 2 courses. but I am pretty much using full time capacity on them. devoting full - time I mean. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] do you like doing school online better than in person? EOS 0 0 9 Have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good the more time you have to devote the better! EOS 0 0 11 I have done both methods. I definitely prefer in - school studies.. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel it is more stressful online? EOS 0 0 13 I am just disappointed that I have been slacking off and procrastinating. no it' s just that it' s a different avenue. I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. I think it' s because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow.. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after. EOS 0 0 15 yeah I take breaks in between.. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Yea this pandemic has me not as motivated to.
0 0 0 Hello my situation is that I' m facing an enormous amount of academic pressure. EOS 0 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Hello. Academic work can be overwhelming at times. I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though. Could you tell me what the issue is in particular? EOS 0 0 2 It' s just a huge amount of work that I' m struggling with and a ton of exams and they give me a lot of anxiety. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming. Make sure that you try to be as prepared as you can. When you feel capable of doing well on said exams, you will feel a lot less pressure. EOS 0 0 4 Do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though? EOS 0 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have an academic councelor you can talk to? EOS 0 0 6 yes it' s all virtual though. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well at least is something. I am sure talking to someone who might be able to guide you academically will be a significant relief..
0 0 0 hi there. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m surviving. Today is better than yesterday was. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. What is bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I' ve been out of work since Covid closed down the live event industry in March. the unemployment system still hasn' t processed any of my claims, and I have been surviving off of what I can make driving for doordash, which hasn' t been a lot. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough. The unemployment system has been very slow during COVID, so I completely understand your frustration and worry. I am glad to hear that you are doing door dash, even if you aren' t making a lot that is still something! EOS 0 0 6 ugh, yeah... I drive a really old beat up car though, so I can' t really go out after dark, and I' m worried I' m driving it too much and it' s going to break down. I wish mturk paid more, or one of the jobs I' ve applied for would hire me to do something form home. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I also wish mturk paid more, I feel like it takes a lot of time for not that much money. Do you have a roommate, friend, or family member' s car you could possibly borrow instead of using your own? EOS 0 0 8 No, I live with housemates but they all don' t drive. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. Are you still looking for and applying for jobs? EOS 0 0 10 im sorry im late. I am still applying, but only for what I can do from home, and I worry i am underqualified. are you still there? EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Yes I am still here. When I started working from home I did a lot of research on different types of jobs that I could do from home. There are a lot of work options that are not necessarily well known, in my opinion, for online work. EOS 0 0 12 Before this my work was primarily in concert audio, with a side hustle of carpentry. I' ve been playing with these survey sites, and applying for a lot of call center jobs that don' t seem interested in me. If you have any suggestions I' m open to them! EOS 0 1 13 [Others] If you worked in audio I know that some places, like Upwork and ACX( which does some audiobook work) are looking for audio editing. I am sure that other places are looking for audio editing. I think Fiverr may also be a good place to advertise audio work. I also have an Etsy and Ebay shop, you could possibly sell some of your carpentry work on there if that is possible. Ebay is free to list and Etsy has a small listing fee. EOS 0 0 14 okay, well thanks for chatting with me and helping me earn the bonus for this task! EOS 0 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You' re welcome! I hope I was somewhat helpful.
3 0 0 hi. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hey. How are you? EOS 3 0 2 i am not feeling too great. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why not? EOS 3 0 4 i am not able to find a job for over 5 years. EOS 3 1 5 [Question] How have you been able to get by? EOS 3 0 6 i am on social assiatnce but its not enough and i feel so worthless. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If you keep trying things will work out in the end.
3 0 0 Hi, How are you doing? I am in bad mood.. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] What' s wrong? EOS 3 0 2 This work from home tension and cant go out with my family and parties. It makes me depressed and cant bear this pathedic situation. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. I, too, am struggling with COVID - 19. It' s going to be difficult not to see family during the holidays. We' ll get through this, though, don' t you think. Have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone? Maybe there is a way to find ways to have fun online with your friends and family. We actually played games together recently. Is that something you could do to reconnect? EOS 3 0 4 I am fully occupied with my job. This software field sucks me. Even weekends also they are expecting to work with offshore people. I dont find the time to spend with my partner and kids. EOS 3 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Is there any way you could talk to your supervisor about achieving a better work life balance?
2 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week. EOS 2 1 2 [Question] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely? EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely not. I' m not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It' s just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana. EOS 2 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don' t I don' t see it as a problem:)
7 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you feeling? EOS 7 0 1 Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up( all to be done at the end of this and the next month) EOS 7 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You' re feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you' re worried you won' t be able to succeed. Am I correct? EOS 7 0 3 Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won' t do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well.. EOS 7 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I know exactly how you' re feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot. EOS 7 0 5 I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It' s on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me.. EOS 7 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it' s great you' re taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you' ll be able to succeed! EOS 7 0 7 And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that' s one method I have used.. Thank you for your trust in me.. EOS 7 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don' t overdo it.. EOS 7 0 9 I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible. true, very true.. Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen? EOS 7 1 10 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you. EOS 7 0 11 Thanks for sympathizing and understanding.. EOS 7 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation. EOS 7 0 13 ok. That' s true and I have to do more of that. Phone is also a big distraction for me. I heard that it' s best to get it out of one' s reach for best results.. Timer, great idea.. EOS 7 1 14 [Self-disclosure] Yes, I struggl ed with focus but once I put my phone away, my focus increased a lot. EOS 7 0 15 I think that' s pretty good advice. I know which room I can do this, but just away from temptation plus having an alarm from the other room to go off after an hour or so of reading. ok, I will employ these methods more.. Thank you for sharing these. EOS 7 1 16 [Question] Of course! Is anything else on your mind? EOS 7 0 17 then hopefully after these two courses are done, I can have renewed faith and maturity after the new year and take new courses with better results.. not much, just academic pressure and how to deal with time management and being contentious.. EOS 7 1 18 [Affirmation and Reassurance] yes, that sounds like a great idea. It sounds like you' re really trying to help yourself grow.
0 1 0 [Question] Hello! What can I do to help? EOS 0 0 1 Hello, I' m not sure if there is any help? Without knowing when I can return to work, I will probably remain anxious about the unknown. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m glad to speak to you today. It sounds like you are having anxious thoughts. Can you tell me more? EOS 0 0 3 i am self employed, selling event tickets on the internet, but because of covid, all events are postponed until it is safe to gather in large numbers. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how you might feel anxious. There are lots of uncertainties right now. I am sorry you are going through this. Are you able to find work or help from the government? EOS 0 0 5 thank you; fortunately, i have been able to collect unemployment assistance, especially created for self employed people during this difficult time. however, that is due to expire in a few weeks, so once again i am growing anxious about finances. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Living with uncertainties can make anyone feel anxious. Have you tried getting outdoors for a small walk or hike?. EOS 0 0 7 yes, I try to walk outdoors every day, for at least 30 minutes. it does help a lot. but with the weather turning colder, that may be difficult to continue. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It is so important during stressful life events to take care of our minds and bodies. It sounds like you have been making good choices! Have you reached out to family or friends for advice or perhaps help with supplemental employment? EOS 0 0 9 not yet; it is very difficult for me to ask for help. But I may need to do so in the near future. I am fortunate to have a close network of family and friends that I can count on. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am happy to hear you have support during this time. EOS 0 0 11 i would be open to seeking other employment online; work from home on the computer. any suggestions? EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Luckily, there are many platforms online that allow you to work from home. I know of several that allow you to do side" gigs". Perhaps you can search and find a few of these. I, myself have had success doing these. EOS 0 0 13 thanks! i will check it out. in the meantime, any other suggestions for dealing with anxiety? EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Many have found meditation helps relieve anxiety. Most importantly, if you find yourself feeling depressed or worsening symptoms, please contact your medical professional. EOS 0 0 15 ok will do; thanks again for all the helpful info.. EOS 0 1 16 [Others] It was nice speaking with you today. EOS 0 0 17 and you as well. take care, and Happy Holidays! EOS 0 1 18 [Greeting] Happy Holidays to you as well!
0 1 0 [Question] Hello there, how are you feeling?. EOS 0 0 1 im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?. EOS 0 0 3 yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not. EOS 0 0 5 very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn' t see me cuz he was busy. now he' s asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. EOS 0 1 6 [Reflection of feelings] That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?. EOS 0 0 7 confused! i' ll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn' t like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him? EOS 0 0 9 cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are? EOS 0 0 11 yes but i' m afraid what i' ll hear. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open? EOS 0 0 13 it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i' ll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. EOS 0 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated. EOS 0 0 15 possibly. i' d prob be better being away from the situation. EOS 0 1 16 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run. EOS 0 0 17 I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. EOS 0 1 18 [Question] You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?. EOS 0 0 19 it gives me an upper edge and more clout. EOS 0 1 20 [Question] In what way does it do that? EOS 0 0 21 being on the board gives me perks. EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit? EOS 0 0 23 yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. EOS 0 1 24 [Reflection of feelings] Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there' s an element of mutual manipulation. EOS 0 0 25 yes. EOS 0 1 26 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are definitely not the only person to feel this way! EOS 0 0 27 it' s a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power.. what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me. EOS 0 1 28 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board.
0 0 0 Hi. Is anyone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hi there. EOS 0 0 2 Hi I thought you were not going to show. my anxiety level just increased while I was waiting for you. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] Apologies, I have had issues with my connection which should now be resolved. How can I help you today.
6 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hi there! How may I support you? EOS 6 0 2 Well, I' m really upset with my friends. EOS 6 1 3 [Others] I am so sorry to hear that. Did something happen? EOS 6 0 4 Yes, they aren' t taking COVID seriously. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns? EOS 6 0 6 Yes but they get angry with me. I don' t know how to get through to them, EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It' s also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right.
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Greeting] Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday? EOS 6 0 2 I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I' m too scared to do anything about it as I don' t want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can' t help it. EOS 6 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through. EOS 6 0 4 Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I' m a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I' ve dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self - respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it. EOS 6 0 6 What happened out of interest when you had the conversation? EOS 6 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist. Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more. Since that time, he denies everything. EOS 6 0 8 I know. I' m a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It' s superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas' punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends.. EOS 6 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Honestly, its not anyone else' s business. IF you' re suspicions are in fact correct, then you' ve got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart - breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she' s cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o= is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER! Curiously, why do you think she' s cheating? EOS 6 0 10 I' m almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two.. EOS 6 1 11 [Question] Hmm... So have you two live together? How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation? EOS 6 0 12 That' s just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven' t approached it with her because I' m scared see will just leave and I' ll be a laughing stock. I suppose I' m a joke either way! EOS 6 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Don' t get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There' s always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations. EOS 6 0 14 very true. I suppose I have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think I should just talk to her? EOS 6 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful... I only want to help you..
3 1 0 [Question] hi there? EOS 3 0 1 Hi. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] how are you? what' s new with you? EOS 3 0 3 I am not doing so great.

EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you tried maybe using a timer or making a list to help keep you focused on decluttering one area at a time? Of course!

EOS 6 0 4 Yes, they aren' t taking COVID seriously. EOS 6 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns? EOS 6 0 6 Yes but they get angry with me. I don' t know how to get through to them, EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It' s also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right. EOS 6 0 8 I really don' t know I just haven' t been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out. It' s a weird dynamic. EOS 6 1 9 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you' re finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it' s the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right? EOS 6 0 10 That' s exactly right. EOS 6 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is such a hard position to be in. it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance.
4 0 0 Hello. Is anyone there. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you today? EOS 4 0 2 I' m doing good. I need some advice. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] What can I help you with? EOS 4 0 4 Lately, my friends started to make jokes about my face being ugly. They even called my face as flat as a pan! What should I do? I see them everyday on the bus. EOS 4 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you tried confronting them and asking why they are being bullies?
0 1 0 [Question] hello how are you today? EOS 0 0 1 Hello I am taking a break from my studies to talk. I am fine thanks. Hope you are doing well also. I am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines. EOS 0 1 2 [Self-disclosure] i am fine thanks for asking. EOS 0 0 3 two exams and two assignments due at the end of this and next month. that' s good. EOS 0 1 4 [Others] Aw i am sorry to hear that, school deadlines can be very stressful. EOS 0 0 5 yeah I have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it' s online and basically I do things on my own time.. EOS 0 1 6 [Question] are you taking a lot of courses? EOS 0 0 7 2 courses. but I am pretty much using full time capacity on them. devoting full - time I mean. EOS 0 1 8 [Question] do you like doing school online better than in person? EOS 0 0 9 Have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one. EOS 0 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thats good the more time you have to devote the better! EOS 0 0 11 I have done both methods. I definitely prefer in - school studies.. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel it is more stressful online? EOS 0 0 13 I am just disappointed that I have been slacking off and procrastinating. no it' s just that it' s a different avenue. I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. I think it' s because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow.. EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after. EOS 0 0 15 yeah I take breaks in between.. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] Yea this pandemic has me not as motivated to. EOS 0 0 17 But sometimes a lot more breaks or longer breaks than intended or I should. yeah definitely. Sorry to hear that.. It' s like everyday is the same and I can' t go out to refresh my mind or have a change of pace such as going to the gym or go out for a run. whereas before the pandemic, I can switch gears that way and come back refreshed. like going out to the movies and coming back with renewed enthusiasm. EOS 0 1 18 [Self-disclosure] Yea i have been missing the gym myself. Now i lookup youtube videos of workouts and do them, and it really helps to get me going in the day. Do you ever listen to music while you are trying to get work done? When i do that it tends to help time go faster and i get more done. EOS 0 0 19 I see. Yeah it' s good to have a routine and good way to resume life as usual.. sometimes I listen to music but I find it hard to read and absorb and listen to music. But I do listen to music sometimes when I am on assignments.. I also tend to drink coffee to focus my mind better. It does help. And I know I can pass the courses and on time but just that I am disappointed at my performance and work ethics as I know I have done much better before. So I am missing that sense of urgency, conscientiousness, and maturity., EOS 0 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe find a nice meditation song to help relax you, i find when i am doing something finding a song with no words is better so i am able to concentrate. EOS 0 0 21 I see. That' s a good idea. I was also thinking I should have a regular workout routine at home again because I used to work out much more daily, even at home.. EOS 0 1 22 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It sounds like you are a very smart person and are able to acknowledge when you need to work harder on something. Don' t be to hard on yourself this pandemic is affecting everyone.

EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Is living with your brother a bad thing? What specifically is making you upset? EOS 3 0 4 yes it is. he acts like a azz most of the time. he dosent care about anyone but himself. just like his fiancé. he throws away the bills and expects me to pay to keep the utilities on when they are about to be disconnected. then tells me i dont contribute to the house.. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems like he would be a very difficult person to live with. And that is hard for you obviously. I' m thinking your upset because you can' t leave so you' re stuck. Is that correct? EOS 3 0 6 yes, felling very stuck.. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s completely normal to feel that way. I' m sure you' re handling the situation as best as you can. What have you done to try and help the situation? EOS 3 0 8 trying to, looking for every way possible to make money and save it up and move out. really dont want to have to partition the property as its the house we grew up in.. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I would feel the same way if that' s a house I grew up in. I' m so sorry! EOS 3 0 10 i tried to talk to him, in his mind its all my fault he cant pay the bills he had before i moved in. i had been living in california for the last few years, but came back with corona virus on the rise there.. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If he' s in a certain mindset, it would be hard to change that. Do you have people to talk to about this? It sounds like a lot to handle.

EOS 4 0 11 for 5 years. but he thinks that i have affair with his girlfriend. EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] oh yea that can make things difficult, but i think if you keep reaching out you may could talk this over. Did you try to explain to him that his thoughts were not true? EOS 4 0 13 yeah but how should i start because he misjudged me and his girlfriend its a sensitive issue. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would start off by telling him that you were sorry that he had those thoughts but there is no truth to it and the fact that he does not trust you enough to know that is hurtful to you and her. If that does not work then you might need to take some time to reflect and figure out if that is a friendship worth trying to save, you may find yourself better off without a friend who shows no trust in you. EOS 4 0 15 please give me some suggegtion that what should i do now. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would continue trying to reach out to him and until you can get in touch with him maybe find some thing to do to occupy your mind as to where it does not bother you so much. do you have any hobbies? EOS 4 0 17 yeah i like to play football. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe go play some football to get your mind off of it. EOS 4 0 19 yeah sure. EOS 4 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] from chatting with you seem like a nice person, try not to let it get you down. EOS 4 0 21 now im feeling well because of you.

EOS 1 0 4 Yes. Well today I had a delivery order. So I went to McDonald' s and pick up the order and took it to the right address and after a few hours I notice that the client did not confirm the order. EOS 1 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I am not knowledgeable in this service industry. Let me understand. You delivered the order, but the customer did not confirm they wanted it.. EOS 1 0 6 Five minutes later my supervisor called me saying that the client call and reported that he did not received his order. And that' s not true at all, I gave him the food. So now i don' t know if they going to fired me or let me keep the job. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation? EOS 1 0 8 Of course I did. He told me he going to give me the benefit of the doubt but that is not enough. Im an honest person and this kind of accusation makes me feel very bad. EOS 1 1 9 [Reflection of feelings] I understand, but do not feel bad about yourself. You did your work honestly and delivered the food to your customer. Can I suggest something moving forward?. EOS 1 0 10 Yes. But stuff like that makes me look bad and makes people dont trust me. Sure. That can help. I would appreciate it. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe every time you make a delivery, you can take a picture of it for proof. or maybe you can have a copy of the receipt and have the customer sign it as well. EOS 1 0 12 Well. I normally take pictures of every delivery I make but I let this pass and look what happened. EOS 1 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] it' s okay, it happens to everyone. we are human and we tend to make the smallest mistakes. The important thing is to learn from them.. Is there anything else bothering you at work? EOS 1 0 14 Yes. It won' t happen again for sure. This makes me dont trust people again. Well. This is the first time I ever faced this kind of problem at work. EOS 1 1 15 [Affirmation and Reassurance] as long as you believe in yourself to be honest, don' t worry about what other people think. Your boss will come to understand you are a honest worker. It is also amazing that you have come such a long way without having other problems. that is great!. EOS 1 0 16 I know but sometimes one small thing can hurt you and ruined the reputation that you had build for a long time. EOS 1 1 17 [Reflection of feelings] Yes, i understand what you are saying. It' s really hard to move on from bad experiences, staying positive is important in these situations. EOS 1 0 18 Yes. I guess so. You are right. I just going to move on and do my things.

EOS 6 0 4 Not being able to find a job after graduation. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can understand how you are feeling i had the same problem after i graduated. EOS 6 0 6 okay. EOS 6 1 7 [Question] have you put in job applications everywhere. EOS 6 0 8 Yes I did, and quite a lot but I think because of the pandemic they are not hiring that much. EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] With this pandemic going on i know it is even more harder to get a job. EOS 6 0 10 yes. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] you are right. Have you looked on the internet such as indeed?
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, how can I help you today? EOS 0 0 1 I am having problems because I need money and the only jobs I can find are outside of the hours I need to work and I' m having anxiety. EOS 0 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching? EOS 0 0 3 Yes, I called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but I will still be coming home late. So I am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. Well* EOS 0 1 4 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well! What makes you anxious about coming home late? EOS 0 0 5 I am walking. EOS 0 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking? EOS 0 0 7 Yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. Maybe I could call an Uber home. EOS 0 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If that would help you ease your anxiety, I think it would be a good solution to consider! EOS 0 0 9 I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] What makes you anxious about walking home late? EOS 0 0 11 Like I am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and I jsut came home and have been missing him and I am torn between the two states. Also just safety issues. EOS 0 1 12 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand about the safety issues, I too cannot stand walking alone at night. EOS 0 0 13 What do you do for safety? EOS 0 1 14 [Question] How long have you been in this long - distance relationship? EOS 0 0 15 Two months but we' ve known each other way longer than that. EOS 0 1 16 [Self-disclosure] I try to avoid walking and either ask someone to come and get me, or take an Uber or the bus or my own car! EOS 0 0 17 I think the Uber is a good idea. I don' t have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it. EOS 0 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together? EOS 0 0 19 I don' t feel too guilty about the Uber, mostly worried about affording it to be honest. Yeah we went to middle school together. EOS 0 1 20 [Others] I' m sorry, that' s what I meant, affording it( language issues my bad) EOS 0 0 21 Oh it' s okay my bad! EOS 0 1 22 [Question] Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together? EOS 0 0 23 Yes. EOS 0 1 24 [Question] Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress? EOS 0 0 25 Well mostly he' shaving problems affording rent too and I can' t help him much and it sucks that I can' t help him ata ll. EOS 0 1 26 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ah, i get it. So what I' m understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that' s what' s making you anxious? EOS 0 0 27 Yes. EOS 0 1 28 [Question] Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally? EOS 0 0 29 It makes me feel sad and lost. I' m afraid he' s going to lose his apartment. EOS 0 1 30 [Question] Does it bring back memories of another time where you felt helpless or is this the first time you' re feelling this way? EOS 0 0 31 No it doesn' t. EOS 0 1 32 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this. EOS 0 0 33 Yes. I helped him financially a lot but I' m at my end too now. EOS 0 1 34 [Question] Were you the one that offered to help in the first place?. EOS 0 0 35 Yes. EOS 0 1 36 [Reflection of feelings] Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well? EOS 0 0 37 No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn' t leave me financially behind. EOS 0 1 38 [Question] Oh okay, so you wouldn' t say that you' re looking for a job to continue helping him financially? EOS 0 0 39 No I wouldn' t. I want it to help support me. EOS 0 1 40 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Ok that' s good to hear! EOS 0 0 41 Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I' ve been relying on doing surveys online. EOS 0 1 42 [Reflection of feelings] From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position. EOS 0 0 43 Yes. EOS 0 1 44 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn' t easy at all. EOS 0 0 45 Also being far away from him sucks. EOS 0 1 46 [Question] Are you guys FaceTiming or communicating at all other than by texts? EOS 0 0 47 You are being very helpful by the way thank you. We aren' t FaceTiming. I just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it.. EOS 0 1 48 [Greeting] I' m trying my best, thank you for the input! Upset about leaving the apartment? Or was there something else that happened that weekend? EOS 0 0 49 Just leaving him. EOS 0 1 50 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you guys thought about scheduling date nights through FaceTime? EOS 0 0 51 I think he would but he hasn' t been feeling really good about his appearance lately. I asked and that' s what he told me. EOS 0 1 52 [Self-disclosure] I understand that completely, I can relate a lot. EOS 0 0 53 Same. EOS 0 1 54 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If it makes any difference, my partner and I have been doing date nights where we would dress up, put make up on and do our hair and everything as if we were going to the restaurant, and even if it is through Facetime or whenever we see each other in real life, it helps not only with our own self - esteem but also our relationship. EOS 0 0 55 That is very cute. EOS 0 1 56 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Maybe you could open the discussion with your boyfriend, tell him that you have a date planned over Facetime and you want him to order his favorite dinner, take a shower, do his hair and dress up real nice. EOS 0 0 57 I don' t know if he would be open to that but I could try. He isn' t really the romantic type. EOS 0 1 58 [Question] You have been friends for a long time before getting together, you guys are comfortable with each other, right?
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you doing today? EOS 3 0 2 well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. My life is done now. EOS 3 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband. EOS 3 0 4 well, I cannot say it is a new start when I will be 90 in March.

I know I' m going to badly because I haven' t been learning well during the pandemic. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Okay, I understand, I see how that can also make your anxiety worse. Currently, on a scale of 1 - 10 how well are you understanding your course material? EOS 0 0 6 Probably 4. My roommates are just so loud and inconsiderate, I can' t make any progress studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s completely normal you haven' t made any progress. That would make things so hard and I applaud you for coming so far with that going on!

Have you confronted the ex friend? EOS 5 0 5 nope. we are not on speaking terms. We have sued each other in court before. we are past talking.

4 0 0 Hello. EOS 4 1 1 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am here. How are you? I feel that I can really help you on this Christmas Night. EOS 4 0 2 Not too well. I am feeling pretty down right now. EOS 4 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] How long have you not been feeling not so well? EOS 4 0 4 Today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. He broke up with me today. We were at school( our college campus), and we had a huge fight. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run. EOS 4 0 6 Maybe I can think that way in time, but right now I don' t know what to do with myself. EOS 4 1 7 [Self-disclosure] Well, I have been in rough relationships, but there is no need to add additional trauma to the situation. EOS 4 0 8 I probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. That' s true, but that doesn' t make me feel any better about it right now. EOS 4 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress. EOS 4 0 10 Yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays. EOS 4 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts? EOS 4 0 12 I have actually read about that, but I have a hard time focusing when I meditate. I suppose I just need to practice more. EOS 4 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are online resources to help you get in a better frame of mind. EOS 4 0 14 Like the Calm app? EOS 4 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one. EOS 4 0 16 I like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. What else can I do besides meditation? EOS 4 1 17 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] You said that you are allergic to incenses of all kinds? EOS 4 0 18 Most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. Candles are much better for me. EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil. EOS 4 0 20 I haven' t heard of that website before. I' ll have to check it out. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships. EOS 4 0 22 Well, I haven' t been in a long - term relationship like this before.. My past relationships were all in high school, and they only lasted a few weeks or months at a time. I really cared for this one, and we were together for so long. EOS 4 1 23 [Reflection of feelings] I feel obligated to help during Christmas because I had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts. EOS 4 0 24 You had a fight with your partner? I' m sorry, it' s the worst when people fight over what' s supposed to be something nice. EOS 4 1 25 [Question] What was the fight over? Food? Money? Sex? EOS 4 0 26 I forget what started it, it was something stupid. He didn' t like the way I said something and it kind of blew up from there. We were fighting over the smallest things these last few months. It just kind of built up to the point where he said he couldn' t take fighting with me anymore and just wanted to end it. EOS 4 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would let things decompress for a long while. EOS 4 0 28 End the relationship, I mean. You think maybe if we just take some time apart, he might want to talk about it? EOS 4 1 29 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I suggest thinking through ending the relationship if he has a hot temper.. EOS 4 0 30 He does get upset very easily. EOS 4 1 31 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, just think it through for some time.. EOS 4 0 32 I do think it is important to take some time and breathe. EOS 4 1 33 [Question] Was the relationship with him pleasant for many months?
3 0 0 Hi, how' s your day going? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello. Im doing good. How are you doing? EOS 3 0 2 Not so good unfortunately. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Why. Can you talknto me about it?
3 0 0 Hi, how' s your day going? EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello. Im doing good. How are you doing?
7 0 0 Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well. EOS 7 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well I can help you study if you' d like? EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material... EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study! EOS 7 0 4 My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted. EOS 7 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version. EOS 7 0 6 Wow, that' s actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me. EOS 7 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot. EOS 7 0 8 That is true. I will reach out to her now. EOS 7 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will do just fine, you can do it! EOS 7 0 10 I still have some self - doubt given that I have failed an exam in the past... EOS 7 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam. EOS 7 0 12 I really appreciate this advice. I am feeling better about the exam and feel like I should envision myself passing and doing well. EOS 7 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, thats the spirit it works for me! EOS 7 0 14 I will give it a try! EOS 7 1 15 [Question] Okay is there anything else I can help you with or should I let you go? EOS 7 0 16 No, I should go study now. thank you for your help. EOS 7 1 17 [Others] Of course anytime, have a goodnight! EOS 7 0 18 You too! Wait! I have another concern. EOS 7 1 19 [Question] Yes, what is that? EOS 7 0 20 Do you have any tips for staying cool under pressure while I am taking my exam? EOS 7 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes I do actually. First make sure you get a good nights sleep so your brain can rest and function at its best. Next get to class a little early so you have time to soak up the energy in the room and you get a sense of your surroundings. Take it easy and do not rush. Just one question at a time, next thing you know its over. EOS 7 0 22 That is great advice. I will certainly try and get a good night of rest. EOS 7 1 23 [Question] Great anything else?
3 0 0 hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 3 0 2 i am ok so far. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] What brings you here today? EOS 3 0 4 i am depressed. and need some inspiration. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression? EOS 3 0 6 Covid - 19. and money issues. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, this has really been a hard time for all of us. How has it impacted you personally? EOS 3 0 8 my mom and sister had caught the virus they are doing ok now but it was rough. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how hard that must have been. I' m glad they are doing ok now though! EOS 3 0 10 yeah me too. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] How have you been using your time during the crisis? EOS 3 0 12 yeah mostly working and meditation. EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] That' s great! Meditation is also something I' ve picked up during this time. It' s really helpful and can keep you balanced. Do you have a routine or do you just do it sporadically? EOS 3 0 14 i mostly do it sporadically but i do need to do it more often. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It' s great to try to integrate it into your day. All of us tend to have at least a few moments each day to ourselves. Even if it' s during a shower or bathroom break, you really can meditate anywhere! It' s all about being in the here and now. EOS 3 0 16 so true. EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] When things get stressful, meditation can be difficult. Sometimes we get wrapped up so much in our emotions that trying to center yourself and focus on your breathing and the moment can be hard. One thing I' ve learned to be helpful when I' m stressed is to breathe in through my nose while internally counting to three and out through my mouth counting to three. The counting tends to distract my mind from whatever stressful thing I was thinking of before. EOS 3 0 18 i like that thank you for the tip i must use that more often. EOS 3 1 19 [Question] You' re welcome! Is there anything else you' d like to talk about? EOS 3 0 20 no that will be thanx for listening to me. EOS 3 1 21 [Greeting] My pleasure! I hope things start to look up for you. This has been a difficult time for all of us, but we' ll pull through together! Nice speaking with you. Have a great day!
0 0 0 Hello, how are you? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. I am good, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m doing well, but it could have been better. EOS 0 1 3 [Question] What seems to be bothering you tonight? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, my boy friend of 3 years has refused to take our relationship to the next level and I' m kind of getting tired, I don' t want to play games anymore. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So just to make sure I understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don' t feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,. EOS 0 0 6 exactly, I hate to feel that I' m wasting my time. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand that, as I was in a long term relationship and I felt as though my girlfriend at the time did not want to take things to the next step and I was not happy about it.. EOS 0 0 8 Yes, I love him so dearly to want to settle down with him, but if he doesn' t want that for me I would rather call it quits now than continue and be disappointed at the long run.. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you had that conversation with him? I know it might be a difficult conversation to have, but it is often good to get expectations out in the open so you are on the same page with your partner.. EOS 0 0 10 Yes, sort of and he gave me the impression that he is not there yet and that was a like almost a year ago, I don' t want it to look like I' m pushing him if I try to talk to him again about it. His nonchalant attitude in not seeing the seriousness of it is killing me, I' m just not happy. EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] That is tough, but sometimes people just portray things differently, for instance I am also very laid back and nonchalant about most things which can lead to miscommunications.. I don' t think it would be pushing if you haven' t had that conversation in almost a year. EOS 0 0 12 I hope you are right, just don' t want to come across as a desperate person and that' s why I' m setting myself up to call it quits if he tries to sound like he sounded the last time. EOS 0 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You need to know where he is so you can make a good decision for yourself! I know it is difficult, but I know you can get through it! EOS 0 0 14 You are right, that' s exactly what I' m going to do because the wait is killing me. EOS 0 1 15 [Others] Good, I am happy for you! EOS 0 0 16 Thank you very much, you' ve been a great help. EOS 0 1 17 [Others] I am glad I was able to help! EOS 0 0 18 Thanks, it was nice chatting with you. EOS 0 1 19 [Greeting] You' re welcome! If you need any more help just chat back with us again.

2 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 2 0 1 Not so great - found out i' m losing my job in january. EOS 2 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] On no I am sorry to hear that! I know that must be tough. EOS 2 0 3 Yes I' m not even sure what steps to take right now. EOS 2 1 4 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea that can be difficult. Have you started looking for something else? EOS 2 0 5 Not yet, I' m not even sure where to begin. I have not looked for a job in 20 years. EOS 2 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way. EOS 2 0 7 I' ve tried calling the unemployment office to get some ideas but they do not answer their phones. EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Or you could look for some side jobs like cleaning or organizing things until you find something more permanent.
2 0 0 Hey. I am really scared about my job prospects. I am really fearful about my job situation. EOS 2 1 1 [Question] When did this fear start? EOS 2 0 2 It has been a while. I have had fears going back to my childhood traumas. I think that the work situation has only exacerbated that. The current economic climate has really made me fearful.... not sure if I am going to be able to keep my job. EOS 2 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like your childhood trauma and the economy is the cause for you not being confident in your job situation. Is this correct? EOS 2 0 4 Somewhat. But, my fears are relevant because I don' t know if I will always have a job. EOS 2 1 5 [Question] Do you have anyone you can talk to about this? A relative or a close peer at your job? EOS 2 0 6 Do you know what I mean? What say u? I have some, but they have their own problems to deal with. Everyone has problems. Do you know what I mean? EOS 2 1 7 [Self-disclosure] You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me. EOS 2 0 8 It is making me have flashbacks of other traumatic situations, I think I need to find a good support chain, for sure. What say u? You take alooonnng time to respond. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There are many counselors who specialize in this field of job security and especially during this pandemic and the falling economy, they are great support systems. EOS 2 0 10 I am having a hard time.... Ok, I will look some of them online. I need some financial planners to help as well. Many Americans are hurting. EOS 2 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. Just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic.

I have very close friend who has ADHD and trying to cope with it. EOS 0 0 9 Thankyou for allowing me some of your time. I would be so much better if my heart wasnt poorly. I could then be medicated properly. As of now i just have to live with it. Kinda sucks. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Are you seeing any counselor to address your challenge? EOS 0 0 11 I feel for your friend. EOS 0 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Thank you.. you know you are not alone in such journey... EOS 0 0 13 yes i have a therapist and currently on a 10 week post detox intensive plan to keep me focused. I have a good support network.

4 1 0 [Question] Hi, what brings you to seek support, today? EOS 4 0 1 I am having ongoing depression. EOS 4 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin? EOS 4 0 3 I have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It first began a couple of weeks ago. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I see. Are you sad or anxious about anything in particular? EOS 4 0 5 Yes, I am sad and anxious about the coronavirus.

EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Okay, thanks for sharing that personal information. I only ask because thoughts of suicide are normal and anxiety and depression increase the chances of suicide. EOS 4 0 11 You' re welcome. I understand, but I am not suicidal. EOS 4 1 12 [Question] What would you like to talk about, then? We could talk about the problem more, or if you feel like it is defined, we could talk about solutions, or not talk about solutions at all. What would make you feel better? EOS 4 0 13 I would like to talk about solutions since I feel like the problem is defined. EOS 4 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I know what it is like to be depressed. I also take medication for this. For solutions, studies show that working out and exercising can help depression. Have you considered this? EOS 4 0 15 Yes, I enjoy taking walks and doing a cardio workout at home. EOS 4 1 16 [Question] That' s great! What ways do you think you could communicate more with your family?

Yes, it was for me, a total of$ 10000. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] Oh, That is a very large amount of money. I can understand your being upset with them. Have you talked to them about the money and returning it? EOS 1 0 6 Yes, i am very very upset. What would you do in my position? Yes, she just sounded non - comittal, saying that she will return it when she can. EOS 1 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I see. It is a financially difficult time for us all. I am wondering if your friend might be upset and embarrassed that they can not pay you back immediately? Have you asked her if she could even afford some sort of small payments? EOS 1 0 8 Yes, i asked her how we could restructure the payment in her favor because i understand how difficult it is for everyone right now but she did not answer. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Were you speaking on the phone or in person? Is this a financial burden for you? Would you consider this person a good friend? Would you be sad if they were not in your life anymore?
0 0 0 Hello I was wondering if I can discuss the effects of the pandemic have on my mental health.. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How has the pandemic affected your mental health? EOS 0 0 2 Well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. Just feeling stress and fear from the second wave.. EOS 0 1 3 [Self-disclosure] I understand how hard living through this pandemic is. It is such crazy time! I also have felt fear and stress from the second wave of the pandemic. It is natural to feel stressed when there is a global pandemic. I am sure with the correct coping strategies you can handle this pandemic!
0 1 0 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 1 Am ok but feeling sad and anxious. EOS 0 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I' m sorry to hear that you are sad and anxious. Do you know what is causing you to feel that way? EOS 0 0 3 Yes. I recently lost my childhood best friend to covid 19. EOS 0 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can only imagine how sad you feel from losing your best friend. Hopefully chatting some will help. I know in the past when I lost someone it was nice to just have a conversation to help put my mind at ease. EOS 0 0 5 Sure. I feel so lonely sometimes because we were very close. EOS 0 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I can imagine that you are feeling lonely. Did you have any mutual friends with your best friend that you can reach out to? I am sure they are feeling the same way and it could help both of you to talk to each other and share stories. EOS 0 0 7 Yes we have mutual friends. I do reach out to them sometimes. But the feeling doesn' t go away. It makes me have sleepless nights. I can' t sleep. Every time I close my eyes I see him very close to me like we are having conversations. EOS 0 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you were really close to your best friend. It can take time to get through the grief of losing someone. Things will get better I promise. EOS 0 0 9 I hope so too. And I hope he is a better place. Have you ever lost someone close to you? EOS 0 1 10 [Self-disclosure] I lost my father when I was 19. That was pretty tough and it took me years to be OK with it. There are still days a decade later where I think about him and miss him. EOS 0 0 11 Sorry to hear that.. EOS 0 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Time heals all wounds. While that doesn' t sound helpful now it is true. I also found focusing on the good experiences I had with my father( or in this case your best friend) helps. Remembering the times where you both were happy. EOS 0 0 13 I will try to do that. How can I handle this sleepless nights? EOS 0 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That' s a tough one. I personally still struggle with sleep for other reasons. Some things that can help is taking melatonin 30 minutes before bed. I have also had some luck with white noise machines or other soothing sound machines. The biggest thing is to not use your bedroom for anything but sleeping; so don' t read a book or play on your phone in bed, you have to train your body that when you go to bed it is time to sleep. EOS 0 0 15 Sounds like stuff I can try out. I have a strong attachment to my phone. Will be a tough one to try leaving it off while I try to get some sleep. EOS 0 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Having a bedtime routine is also another tip. Try to do the same thing every night before bed. Have a consistent bedtime, wake up around the same time everyday, even on days that you don' t have to go to work. Yes, phone' s are tough to give up but soooo many studies show how bad they are for your sleep. I believe in you though, you will get through this. EOS 0 0 17 Good thoughts there. Will definitely try out the tips. I feel better already just talking to you. Thank you, Bye. EOS 0 1 18 [Greeting] You are welcome. I am sorry for your loss and I hope for the best for you.
0 0 0 I have anxiety about what avenue to take academically. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello! Don' t worry, I am here to help. So you are saying that you are not sure what career to study? EOS 0 0 2 I do have an idea about it but I am anxious about choosing wrong and boxing myself into something I wish I hadn' t chosen. EOS 0 1 3 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Even if you chose wrong, you will generally have plenty of time to make up your mind and choose something that you really like:), plus, you can reach out to academic advisors, for example. EOS 0 0 4 I suppose you' re right, I think I don' t have confidence in myself that what ever I do choose, I will be good at it. Good enough to make a life out of it. fear of failing myself because i lose interest in things over time. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently. EOS 0 0 6 but what if that thing is your career choice? EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That is a totally normal aspect of human nature. It' s normal to get bored of things even if we really liked them at some point. Of course, some topics like those are more serious, but as I said, even if you chosed wrong, you can always change your major. EOS 0 0 8 I guess thats right. All I care about is helping others so as long as the choice i make supports that then it will be fine. thank you for your help. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] No problem, and it' s great that you like helping others. I am a firm believer that ultimately making others happy is what makes us happy.
0 1 0 [Question] Hi, I' m here to listen. What' s going on? EOS 0 0 1 Thank you. I' ve lost my job and I' m very nervous about the future. As a result I am having a hard time sleeping. EOS 0 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] Wow, that' s very hard. I would be anxious too. EOS 0 0 3 That makes me feel a lot better. Have you ever lost your job? EOS 0 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I have. I was laid off. It was nerve - racking, but also really sad.
3 1 0 [Question] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 1 I' m a little bummed because my friend is not only a junkie but he got arrested last week. EOS 3 1 2 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Ouch! Your friend got arrested for drugs last week? EOS 3 0 3 He got arrested for stealing to fund his addiction. EOS 3 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I had a neighbor who was doing meth, and he got arrested, and that actually saved his life. He had to get sober and look at what he was doing. There is a hard line between helping a friend who is addicted and actually enabling them. Have you ever heard of this?
6 1 0 [Greeting] Hello! EOS 6 0 1 hi. EOS 6 1 2 [Question] How are you doing? EOS 6 0 3 Well I' m distraught. EOS 6 1 4 [Question] Why do you feel that way? EOS 6 0 5 Because my girlfriend has left me. EOS 6 1 6 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That must be really hard for you. I haven' t personally had to deal with that, but I have had friends that have. How long were you together? EOS 6 0 7 four years. EOS 6 1 8 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Being together that long must have made that break up difficult. How are you coping with it? EOS 6 0 9 well I' m not really, especially as she' d gone off with someone else. But I' m to blame which makes it worse. EOS 6 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened? EOS 6 0 11 I cheated on her on a drunken night. It was a one - off and I regret it terribly. But she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain. EOS 6 1 12 [Reflection of feelings] I see how she would be upset. It must be difficult for you though because she didn' t give you another chance. Do you have someone to talk to about your feelings? EOS 6 0 13 yeah, I' m not saying I deserved it just wish she had. But no, not really. No - one who would understand. EOS 6 1 14 [Self-disclosure] I would have wanted a second chance too if I were in your shoes. Is this affecting you really bad?
4 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you? EOS 4 0 1 Hello, thank you for signing up to listen to me. I could be better but thank you for asking. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What' s on your mind? EOS 4 0 3 I am upset about the loss of my best friend' s son dying in a car accident. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] I' m really sorry to hear that. When did this happen? EOS 4 0 5 The accident was Thursday February 25th but he held on until Sunday the 28th. He was only 26 years old. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] There' s nothing that can prepare you for unexpected tragedies like this. We just have to deal with them as they come. EOS 4 0 7 I understand what you are saying but that' s the problem. How to deal with such a terrible unexpected loss. I feel helpless because there is nothing I can do to make her feel better. EOS 4 1 8 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like you' re sticking close to your friend, although it doesn' t feel like its helping. It' s my experience that when someone has experienced a traumatic loss like that, making someone feel better, at least right away, isn' t always an option. The most important thing you can do for her is just to be there for her and allow her to feel however she needs to feel right now. EOS 4 0 9 She is inconsolable..... and me also being upset is not helping matters either. You are exactly right... it' s impossible to help. That is great advice... thank you. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Of course. These things are tough to face on your own, so you did the right thing by reaching out. I know you want to be there for your friend as much as possible, and I think that will help you to move through grief at the same time, but just be mindful to not overextend yourself too much. You have to be there for yourself too. EOS 4 0 11 I actually feel a little better. I will just sit with her and keep her company and be there to listen. I' m glad I accepted this survey today. Enjoy the rest of your day and thank you again! EOS 4 1 12 [Greeting] You too, and best wishes.
2 1 0 [Greeting] Hello. How are you feeling today? EOS 2 0 1 Hi. I' m feeling okayish. EOS 2 1 2 [Reflection of feelings] It sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest. EOS 2 0 3 Absolutely. I recently broke up with my girlfriend. We had been together for more than 3 years. EOS 2 1 4 [Question] What happened that made you guys break up? EOS 2 0 5 She said that she simply wasn' t in love anymore, and that she didn' t have the same feelings she did at the beginning. EOS 2 1 6 [Self-disclosure] I have also had this situation happen to me. Maybe it just wasn' t the right timing or she had other interests. EOS 2 0 7 She was so important for me. I feel so empty.... I Feel like I' m never finding anyone like her ever again, EOS 2 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I' ve had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life. EOS 2 0 9 It' s easier said than done. At times I would rather maybe just dissapear. I have never had anyone else show romantic interest in me before. EOS 2 1 10 [Question] What is your age? EOS 2 0 11 I am 25 at the moment. EOS 2 1 12 [Self-disclosure] You still have your whole life ahead of you. Some people don' t find a partner until their 40' s or even 50' s. When I left my ex I found this guy that I truly fell in love with. He is still sulking in his living room. I told him that if he didn' t move one that he wouldnt get anywhere in life. I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what I would want him to do and I think thats what your girl would want you to do as well.
4 1 0 [Question] HI there, How are you doing today? EOS 4 0 1 Its hard for me to find a job. things could be doing better. it' s been a bad week for me. EOS 4 1 2 [Self-disclosure] I understand that, it is hard to find a job. I got terminated during the beginning of covid. EOS 4 0 3 Yea, i got laid off in July. the market has been tough. EOS 4 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I actually took a job at walmart just to make ends meet. Not the best situation but hey, my family can eat. EOS 4 0 5 thats good. i' m an engineer and i would like to take another engineering role. but they are hard to come by now adays. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea, would you consider doing something lesser for now just to make sure you have some income coming in? Or do you still collect unemployment at least? EOS 4 0 7 yes, i still get some unemployment which helps. i' ve done many interviews. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Thats good at least. Well, its great you are being proactive about it! I hate saying this but, just hang in there and keep moving on. EOS 4 0 9 yes. so i' m hoping to find something soon before the holidays. yes thank you. i just want to be able to buy presents for my family. and make it to 2021. EOS 4 1 10 [Others] I hear ya, im doing everything i can to make a bit of extra money just so my kid can have a semi normal christmas! EOS 4 0 11 yes exactly, i have two young ones. its already hard for them to be at home all day and zoom for school. i just want to make this christmas specia. so its been a bummer with covid going on. EOS 4 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yea i feel so bad for her. Thing is so presents arent everythign. Since you got little ones might be time for some new traditions. Make some" igloo" forts and have an indoor snowball fight with balled of socks or something like that. EOS 4 0 13 thanks. well i' m going to have to continue looking for jobs on linkedin. thank you for your time. EOS 4 1 14 [Greeting] Thanks for sharing! EOS 4 0 15 any other advice to offer me. before i go. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hmm lets see, more a fun thing to do then advice, my daughter saw some xmas dessert she wants to make. Its pretty simple. Get some candy canes and poke em into marshmellows. Melt some chocolate and dip the marshmellows into them. Cover with sprinkles and let harden. Might be a fun thing to do. Id focus on experience over material this holiday. EOS 4 0 17 awesome. those are some great ideas. and not cost a lot of money. EOS 4 1 18 [Greeting] Yea, i hope things work out for you!
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] hello, what is on your mind today. EOS 3 0 2 I feel bad putting this on your shoulders, maybe you can help. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] i have big shoulders! whats on your mind? EOS 3 0 4 I' m just struggling a lot to find the motivation to do anything at all, even the most basic of things. Sometimes I get very intense feelings of sadness and just want to drop everything I' m doing, like I can' t do anything more. EOS 3 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] i think a lot of people are feeling that way these past few months. do you think it is covid related? not sickness, more depression. EOS 3 0 6 Yes that' s very true, depression is probably hitting people the worst right now. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] its becoming a new normal lol. EOS 3 0 8 No I' ve been fighting depression since I was probably like 12 years old, it first really hit me when I moved from where I was living all my life and lost all my friends and I was terrified. Now I' m 29. But covid definitely plays a factor. EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] a few months ago i was feeling the same way. i dont have health insurance but googled and found some online docturs. i got to see a doc and get on antidepressants for less than a hundred. covid plays a factor in EVERYTHING ugh. EOS 3 0 10 So you had the therapy session online with them via webcam or you found them online first then went to see them in person. Yeah covid is doing damage in more ways than one. EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] all online!:) meds shipped to my door. i love it! EOS 3 0 12 Wow that' s great. EOS 3 1 13 [Others] theres a free site called 7 cups that does free peer to peer couseling too. its good when i have a lot on my mind. EOS 3 0 14 I would have to do it in person, I don' t want people I live with to hear about all my pathetic mental problems. Oh 7 cups, I had an account there and met a really nice girl there that was helping me and she was living with an abusive family at the same time, its crazy but now I can' t access that account anymore, I' m so sad about that. I think it says the account doesn' t exist when I try to login now. EOS 3 1 15 [Question] can you make a new one? EOS 3 0 16 Sure I guess I' ll have to do that but I really wanted to get back into that account, don' t want to lose contact with that girl that was helping me. EOS 3 1 17 [Others] cerebral is that one site with the cheap docs. EOS 3 0 18 do you mean um.... cheap med? cerebral seems to be an antidepressant when i googled. EOS 3 1 19 [Others] check the website q and a.
4 0 0 I am so embarassed and saddened. I can not believe he cheated on me. I thought we were going to work out. I was really attracted into him and I cared for him a lot. I wanted to date him longer. Thank Goodness I did not sleep with him. What a disaster. Why are men like this? Why do they break women' s hearts? I wish there were more decent men out there that did not play around. Men can be such pigs! EOS 4 1 1 [Question] what happened? EOS 4 0 2 I met a handsome intelligent man. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] how are you feeling lately? EOS 4 0 4 We dated for a month. Then out of nowhere he cheated on me. I' m so sad. I am just trying to understand what I did wrong. EOS 4 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] it' s okay. we should learn from things like this. EOS 4 0 6 That' s true. It' s crazy we have to experience heart ache. To learn... EOS 4 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] don' t think much and keep yourself engaged in the activities you like the most. EOS 4 0 8 Hey, that is great advice! EOS 4 1 9 [Question] can you tell me how are you before this incident? EOS 4 0 10 I was happy. But when a man breaks your heart, it makes you feel very ugly. EOS 4 1 11 [Reflection of feelings] can you share me some happy memories which made you smile. EOS 4 0 12 Sure, I love going to the movies! How about you! EOS 4 1 13 [Reflection of feelings] it' s okay. i can understand. yeah me too. i love movies and traveling. EOS 4 0 14 Are you American? EOS 4 1 15 [Others] I love traveling to new places.

EOS 0 0 2 I am really struggling with my studies at the moment, I am so anxious that I keep putting off my essays and worrying all the time. EOS 0 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are a student who is having trouble. Is that correct? EOS 0 0 4 Yes, I am a mature student and struggling with my course. EOS 0 1 5 [Self-disclosure] I can understand how you feel. I was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school. It is very understandable that you are feeling stressed, especially with the pandemic and other issues happening. EOS 0 0 6 yes, the pandemic is making it worse. I am working as well so I am struggling juggling them all and running a house. I just don' t know how to get back on track with my studying. EOS 0 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about putting together a schedule to help you manage your time?

EOS 2 0 13 I disagree with you regarding that maybe that is what she wants me to do. I don' t think she cares about me at the slightest anymore. I was a burden for her and will probably keep being it for any woman I meet. EOS 2 1 14 [Question] Did she give you any reasons to why she wasn' t in love anymore? EOS 2 0 15 I think she wasn' t feeling physically attracted to me anymore. EOS 2 1 16 [Question] Did you ever think she maybe possibly has been cheating? EOS 2 0 17 I could not say for sure. But I surely think she wouldn' t cheat on me. EOS 2 1 18 [Others] Has she ever tried to hide text messages, lock her phone, or tell you she is too busy to come over?
6 0 0 Hello. EOS 6 1 1 [Question] Hello, how are you? EOS 6 0 2 I have been better. I had a rough semester in school.. EOS 6 1 3 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So things haven' t been going well at school. I think a lot of people are going through these days. EOS 6 0 4 It was alright at first but I failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade. EOS 6 1 5 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I' m sorry to hear that. That' s a heck of a situation to be in. Is there anything you can do? Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock? EOS 6 0 6 Yes, I already tried to appeal my grade. EOS 6 1 7 [Question] And the teacher wouldn' t budge? EOS 6 0 8 Sadly, no. I think they were too busy to really take a long time to discuss it or work with me. EOS 6 1 9 [Question] Was this for a course that was required for a major? EOS 6 0 10 It was a core class and I needed it to graduate. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Ok, if you' re willing to give it one more shot, try to appeal the grade one more time. If that doesn' t work, you could try talking the class again next semester or during the summer if it' s offered.

EOS 4 0 3 My partner of 9 months cheated on me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Oh wow that is really rough. Do you think you might be able to work it out or is it over permanently? EOS 4 0 5 It is over permanently... EOS 4 1 6 [Self-disclosure] Maybe it is for the best - I have been cheated on before and although it hurt at the time it turned out to be the best favour he could have done me. EOS 4 0 7 Yeah I guess, the relationship was a little toxic and she sometimes only used me for money. Maybe is it for the best now that I think about it. EOS 4 1 8 [Others] Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!! EOS 4 0 9 Yeah I just miss having someone there for me. EOS 4 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] All you need now is to give yourself some TLC.. treat yourself to something nice and go easy on yourself.

Do you have plans for the holidays? EOS 0 1 5 [Others] not really, i will probably just relax. what about you? EOS 0 0 6 Just hanging out at home with my husband and son. EOS 0 1 7 [Others] how' s your relationship with your family? EOS 0 0 8 It is pretty good. We all get along good. No issues. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] glad to hear so! EOS 0 0 10 How is your relationship with your family? EOS 0 1 11 [Others] it' s overly alright but i don' t really get along with my father. EOS 0 0 12 Oh i am sorry to hear that.. EOS 0 1 13 [Self-disclosure] don' t worry, it' s okay i am used to it. EOS 0 0 14 Has the Pandemic affected your work life at all?. EOS 0 1 15 [Question] not really i' ve always worked from home. what about you? EOS 0 0 16 Not me so much. Business was slow for quite a while because nobody was really working. But it affected my husband, because everytime anyone in our house got sick he had to leave work becase his work didnt allow anybody to be there if anybody in there household was sick.. So he missed quite a bit of work. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that must have been really terrible, i hope you all are coping with that. how did that make you feel? EOS 0 0 18 It was nerve wracking because you never knew how long he was going to be out of work for. his work changed their policy about when he could come back everytime he was out. EOS 0 1 19 [Reflection of feelings] just from talking to you i can see that it was very stressing for you. is he back to work yet? EOS 0 0 20 oh yes it defintely was. he is out again because I just tested positive for COVID. So he will be out of work for two weeks. EOS 0 1 21 [Question] is there any possibility of him getting a vaccine? he seems to be testing positive fairly often.
3 0 0 Hello. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] Hello. How are you tonight? EOS 3 0 2 Feeling depressed as usual. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] I' m sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed? EOS 3 0 4 Everything. Life. It' s awful. How many years do you really need to stop enjoying this place. Ya know what I mean. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I understand, but just to make sure I know what is going on fully, you are depressed in general and don' t know how to get through it.. EOS 3 0 6 I would say that is fairly accurate. Often times, I wish an asteroid would come down and begin the apocolypse.. Something to break up the routine. Don' t you find life utterly boring and repetitive?. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Just from these few messages, I can tell you are extremely upset about this.. I have had problems in the past with depression as well, I used to have severe anxiety as well.. EOS 3 0 8 Sorry to hear that. Anxiety and depression are dual bladed sword of badness. Really bad mixture. I never struggled too much with anxiety.. EOS 3 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] It was tough. Have you thought about consulting a psychological professional to help with this issue? I did when I was going through my depression and it really helped.. EOS 3 0 10 NO! I would never do that. I' m already on anti depressants. That didn' t help at all.. I just don' t understand why people like life enough to make more people! It is madness! EOS 3 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I didn' t like the meds that they gave me either, however I felt that talking to someone helped me a great deal.. EOS 3 0 12 Well, I' m glad it helped you. I' m not just saying that. Being depressed is awful.. What did it do for you? How so? EOS 3 1 13 [Self-disclosure] It was good to be able to talk to an objective third party about what was going on. It allowed me to get my feelings out without the threat of being judges or harrassed..

EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you? EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future? EOS 3 0 5 Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it' s true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online? EOS 3 0 7 Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression. EOS 3 0 9 How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] the" little black rain cloud" people? LOL I try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it' s our first. EOS 3 0 11 Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] While there is a lot to focus on that is just awful, it has really helped me to look back to the spanish flue of 1918. that pandemic was followed byt he roaring 20s. EOS 3 0 13 I know people thinking the country will collapse soon. Hard to deal with them. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The doomsday people are always around. remeber they mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012. EOS 3 0 15 I have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. Especially during the holidays. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] are you familiar with Mr. Rogers' story about looking for the helpers when things go bad? EOS 3 0 17 No but I did love that show as a kid. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Family is hard! So many strong emotions and opinions that aren' t always helpful. anyone in particular for you? EOS 3 0 19 My dad and my GF' s dad both have their own opinons on things. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people. EOS 3 0 21 Yes. I also don' t feel like the world will decent into madness, but they do not believe it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] oooh, that' s hard. are you living at home with your dad? as a mom, i can tell you that the unknown for your children is scary. often fear and lack of control come out sideways. EOS 3 0 23 No but near him and take care of him. EOS 3 1 24 [Self-disclosure] that' s really nice of you. i' m 800+ miles away from my parents.
0 0 0 Hello. EOS 0 1 1 [Question] Hello how are you doing today? EOS 0 0 2 Somewhat stressed but otherwise ok. How about you? EOS 0 1 3 [Question] I am great, it snowed and looks like Christmas here. Why are you so stressed? EOS 0 0 4 I' m developing romantic feelings for a friend but she doesn' t share those feelings with me in return. EOS 0 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. I have been there myself.. Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend? EOS 0 0 6 Yes, I had received that advice from someone and tried it but it didn' t help. We have been friends for a long time and I think it would be tough to smother these romantic feelings. EOS 0 1 7 [Question] Have you thought about talking with this friend about these feelings? EOS 0 0 8 I have but I' m sure she wouldn' t react very well and it could damage our relationship.. I' m also pretty sure she' s already aware. She' s pretty sharp. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well maybe you should address these feelings with her in a very relaxed public atmosphere. Just let her know that you really like her and you have realized that she has many of the qualities that you look for in a person to get serious with. However, you treasure your friendship more than anything and you do not want anything to come in between your friendship.... this way you have addressed your feelings, she knows how you feel and then should she decide to every take the friendship to the next step, she wouldn' t feel awkward. EOS 0 0 10 That sounds like a good plan. I do like having things out in the open instead of holding them in. My other thought was to maybe try to seek out a romantic partner that isn' t her so then maybe the feelings would go to another focus and it wouldn' t damage our relatinship. EOS 0 1 11 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That sounds like a great idea. Have you been dating other people much? EOS 0 0 12 No, it has been difficult with the whole Corona virus thing. I have taken a large income hit and also I' m having trouble finding someone who wants to actually go do something. EOS 0 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes the Corona virus has really put a damper on all kinds of normal activities. Have you thought about joining like a group with similar interests as yourself? Maybe look for a local group that has a Facebook page and you can start with building friendships just by chatting online or even on the public page itself. Some of the best lasting relationships start out as friends with similar interests and then they blossom. EOS 0 0 14 I think I' ll give that a try. I could use a new hobby anyways. EOS 0 1 15 [Greeting] Sounds like a great plan, how are you feeling now? EOS 0 0 16 I feel a lot better nwo that I have some options. EOS 0 1 17 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s great, sometimes just being able to talk through things with someone else, really helps to get things in perspective and brainstorm some new ideas. I am glad you are feeling better and hope that you have a great rest of your day.
4 1 0 [Question] Hello, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 I' m sad. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] What happened? EOS 4 0 3 My ex - boyfriend broke up with me. EOS 4 1 4 [Question] Why did he break up with you? EOS 4 0 5 because I didn' t trust him and I was always jelous. EOS 4 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think you should try finding a psychologist to help your jealous. EOS 4 0 7 Yes, I think so, because I should not feel like that, I should trust him. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Apparently psychologist is good for people who want to share feelings and emotions. EOS 4 0 9 Yes, it' s true. Thanks for the information. I' m trying not to talk to him or think about him, because I feel better. EOS 4 1 10 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s good for you to do that. You' ll feel better with time. EOS 4 0 11 But it' s so hard do to that. I spend a lot of time with him. EOS 4 1 12 [Self-disclosure] I feel the same way. When it had happened with me. However, I talked it with my friends and family and made me feel much better.
1 0 0 Hi there, I badly need someone to talk with! EOS 1 1 1 [Question] hi what’s on your mind today. EOS 1 0 2 My partner left me after fifteen years and I simply do not know what to do. EOS 1 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] wow. that had to come as a shock. when did you find out. EOS 1 0 4 Things had not been going well for a while but I had not realised just how bad it would be. EOS 1 1 5 [Question] i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave? EOS 1 0 6 About two weeks. I have barely left the house since then. I just do not feel that I can go on. EOS 1 1 7 [Question] not leaving the house is the new normal for many of us right now. are you not leaving because you have nowhere to go or because you are feeling bad. EOS 1 0 8 I think mostly the latter. I just do not want to face the world any more. I feel that everyone must know that I' ve been dumped and be laughing at me. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time. EOS 1 0 10 I did not really have any choice though. I do not see any future for myself now that we are separated. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] do you know brene brown and her work.
7 0 0 Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well. EOS 7 1 1 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Well I can help you study if you' d like? EOS 7 0 2 How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material... EOS 7 1 3 [Question] What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study! EOS 7 0 4 My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted. EOS 7 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version. EOS 7 0 6 Wow, that' s actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me. EOS 7 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot. EOS 7 0 8 That is true. I will reach out to her now. EOS 7 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m sure you will do just fine, you can do it! EOS 7 0 10 I still have some self - doubt given that I have failed an exam in the past... EOS 7 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam. EOS 7 0 12 I really appreciate this advice. I am feeling better about the exam and feel like I should envision myself passing and doing well. EOS 7 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yes, thats the spirit it works for me! EOS 7 0 14 I will give it a try! EOS 7 1 15 [Question] Okay is there anything else I can help you with or should I let you go?

EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression? EOS 3 0 6 Covid - 19. and money issues. EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Yeah, this has really been a hard time for all of us. How has it impacted you personally? EOS 3 0 8 my mom and sister had caught the virus they are doing ok now but it was rough. EOS 3 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I can understand how hard that must have been. I' m glad they are doing ok now though! EOS 3 0 10 yeah me too. EOS 3 1 11 [Question] How have you been using your time during the crisis?
3 0 0 Hi, how are you today? I feel really sad all the time. I don' t know why. EOS 3 1 1 [Greeting] hello. you feel sad, why? EOS 3 0 2 I' m not sure. I can' t find a reason. My health is fine.

3 0 0 I am feeling depressed. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Can you tell me more about your feelings? EOS 3 0 2 I feel lost and lonely, i do not know what to do. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] When did these feelings come about. EOS 3 0 4 They came about when i lost my job in August of this year. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] I can understand where your coming from with that, especially since this pandemic occurred. EOS 3 0 6 Yes, finances have especially been very tight. EOS 3 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] it seems like this could be overwhelming to you and trying to figure out the right path to go forward. EOS 3 0 8 It is, have you ever encountered such a situation in your life? EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I can relate to you in this situation 100% and if it wasnt for me stepping out on faith and opening my own practice, I wouldnt be here now. EOS 3 0 10 How did you snap out of the situation, did you have some savings? EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Always putting money aside when able, and doing lots of research about first time businesses gave a lot of insights. Have you tried to look into things like that yourself? EOS 3 0 12 Yes, i have been researching a lot too but it is difficult given that i have been surviving on the savings i had. Also it is very difficult to get a loan currently. EOS 3 1 13 [Question] That I do understand as well. This pandemic has made it hard for everyone. Are you a parent with any little ones by chance? EOS 3 0 14 Yes, i have two children, 5 and 9 year olds. EOS 3 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] So here is some information that I have in my files to help others during this time. There is self - help. org that is labeled as being a self help during these times. There is also websites that i used like offerup and PoshMark where I was able to start selling some of my belongings to constantly bring in funds. Also try to google" How to become a first time business owner" and see if any of this information helps you and your family.. EOS 3 0 16 That is very helpful of you. I have been wandering all over the internet lost and not knowing where to find help from. I will definitely check this out and make good use of them. Did you also get any funds from anyone? EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I know that it can be hard and frustrating during this time, but you have to remain focused for your family and stay strong because I am sure they look up to you. With myself I did have to go to a lot of friends and family, but my faith and my blessings came from God. Looking to him to help with your problems and actually listening to his words would really alleviate some of the stress that is so draining. EOS 3 0 18 I agree that God is our ultimate guide and helper in all this. He will never forsake us no matter what. I will definitely turn to him at this time to seek for his guidance and with faith He will see me through. EOS 3 1 19 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Just keep your eyes on the prize because this means that HE has something bigger in store for you! EOS 3 0 20 True, you have been very helpful and i appreciate you taking the time to talk to me. EOS 3 1 21 [Affirmation and Reassurance] You are very welcome and I am glad that I was able to be here for you.
4 0 0 Hello. Is anyone there. EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Hello. How are you today? EOS 4 0 2 I' m doing good. I need some advice. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] What can I help you with?
6 1 0 [Question] Hello, what brings you to bring the seeker? EOS 6 0 1 I feel upset with myself over my situation. Did you read it? EOS 6 1 2 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I did not see it. What is your situation? I am here to listen. EOS 6 0 3 I feel ashamed of my depression symptoms. I feel other people are ashamed of me. EOS 6 1 4 [Self-disclosure] I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how? EOS 6 0 5 I just can' t live reguarly life like" healthy" people do and they notice my symptoms. They don' t understand how your mind can be your enemy. EOS 6 1 6 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you are saying that you can' t live regularly and people don' t understand that your mind isn' t working in your favor. Is that right? Can you tell me what you mean by your mind being your enemy? EOS 6 0 7 Like I have no interest or motivation to do ANYTHING some days. Hard to even take care of my hygiene. My mind doesn' t care to do it even when it' s embarrasing for people to notice. EOS 6 1 8 [Greeting] That sounds very hard. I can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn' t want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself. What do you do to cope? EOS 6 0 9 stay away from mean people, stop tryiig to explain my symptoms to others who won' t get it. EOS 6 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That makes sense why you would want to avoid doing these things, which is a good thing, but is there anything that you try to do that isn' t avoidance? Something that approaches something? EOS 6 0 11 I go to all my therapy appoints and try to participate. Thanks for your help. Have a good day. EOS 6 1 12 [Question] How do you feel about therapy? EOS 6 0 13 I have to go now. Bye. EOS 6 1 14 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is unfortunate, but I understand. We haven' t finished, the task, however, but I hope you feel better. EOS 6 0 15 I can stay a bit longer. I' m just tired. EOS 6 1 16 [Others] I think we just need 3 more responses each, let' s say. EOS 6 0 17 Thanks. EOS 6 1 18 [Question] Okay, so can you tell me how frequently you sleep? EOS 6 0 19 about 3 broken hours a night. EOS 6 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] That sounds awful. I' m sorry. Have you tried researching or practicing any sleep hygiene?
3 0 0 hi there. EOS 3 1 1 [Question] Hello! what seems to be bothering you today? EOS 3 0 2 currently, i am living in a house with my brother, which i co own and can not afford to move out.. EOS 3 1 3 [Question] Is living with your brother a bad thing? What specifically is making you upset? EOS 3 0 4 yes it is. he acts like a azz most of the time. he dosent care about anyone but himself. just like his fiancé. he throws away the bills and expects me to pay to keep the utilities on when they are about to be disconnected. then tells me i dont contribute to the house.. EOS 3 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It seems like he would be a very difficult person to live with. And that is hard for you obviously.

EOS 3 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] It' s completely normal to feel that way. I' m sure you' re handling the situation as best as you can. What have you done to try and help the situation?

EOS 3 1 9 [Self-disclosure] I would feel the same way if that' s a house I grew up in. I' m so sorry! EOS 3 0 10 i tried to talk to him, in his mind its all my fault he cant pay the bills he had before i moved in. i had been living in california for the last few years, but came back with corona virus on the rise there.. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] If he' s in a certain mindset, it would be hard to change that. Do you have people to talk to about this? It sounds like a lot to handle. EOS 3 0 12 right? and his fiancé is the same way, they are both alcoholics and spend most of their income on their habits. its all i can do right now to keep food in the house, let alone running water.. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I think it would be good for you to talk to someone and get help. Right now, all you can do is keep chugging along and trying your best to stay afloat.

EOS 1 0 4 Yes, my school was closed without warning because of COVID. EOS 1 1 5 [Self-disclosure] Oh I understand how that could make you so frustrated, that would make me frustrated too. I am waiting to hear about my school. EOS 1 0 6 Yes I don' t even know what is going to happen with finals now. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I am sure that whatever happens, you will do well with them. Have you thought about talking to an administrator at your school? EOS 1 0 8 I hope so. But I feel like this could have been handled better. Not yet, there is a waiting list to talk to an academic advisor. EOS 1 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] that is all the more reason to be frustrated, i commend you for having to deal with that! EOS 1 0 10 Thanks. I feel like my head is going to explode though. The remainder of the semester is going to be online. EOS 1 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Have you thought about talking to a close friend or someone you trust about these stressors? EOS 1 0 12 Yes, I talked with my friend about it and she said don' t worry. But I can' t help it. EOS 1 1 13 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand why are you are worried though, that is a lot honestly. EOS 1 0 14 I was doing so well in my classes too. Very close to graduating. EOS 1 1 15 [Question] Do you think that your grades will go down with the switch to online? EOS 1 0 16 Yes, I don' t do well with online learning. EOS 1 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I have seen that be the case for many people. Hopefully your professors will be understanding with the switch.

I know a break in trust is always very difficult to process. EOS 0 0 9 I am planing to get married next year but things has changed now. EOS 0 1 10 [Question] Oh I am sorry to hear that. Have you had a conversation with her about her actions and how they have made you feel? EOS 0 0 11 She knew pretty well how I felt. I don' t want to have anything to do with her again. EOS 0 1 12 [Question] Do you feel that her actions and result can be remedied? Or is this such a fundamental break that you cannot reconcile?

0 0 0 hi there. EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hello, how are you? EOS 0 0 2 I' m surviving. Today is better than yesterday was. EOS 0 1 3 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That' s good. What is bothering you? EOS 0 0 4 I' ve been out of work since Covid closed down the live event industry in March. the unemployment system still hasn' t processed any of my claims, and I have been surviving off of what I can make driving for doordash, which hasn' t been a lot. EOS 0 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] That is rough. The unemployment system has been very slow during COVID, so I completely understand your frustration and worry. I am glad to hear that you are doing door dash, even if you aren' t making a lot that is still something! EOS 0 0 6 ugh, yeah... I drive a really old beat up car though, so I can' t really go out after dark, and I' m worried I' m driving it too much and it' s going to break down. I wish mturk paid more, or one of the jobs I' ve applied for would hire me to do something form home. EOS 0 1 7 [Self-disclosure] I completely understand. I also wish mturk paid more, I feel like it takes a lot of time for not that much money. Do you have a roommate, friend, or family member' s car you could possibly borrow instead of using your own? EOS 0 0 8 No, I live with housemates but they all don' t drive. EOS 0 1 9 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I understand. Are you still looking for and applying for jobs? EOS 0 0 10 im sorry im late. I am still applying, but only for what I can do from home, and I worry i am underqualified. are you still there? EOS 0 1 11 [Self-disclosure] Yes I am still here. When I started working from home I did a lot of research on different types of jobs that I could do from home. There are a lot of work options that are not necessarily well known, in my opinion, for online work.

I' ve tried meeting with my friends. I feel ok when I' m with them, but then later, I feel sad again. I can' t spend all my time with my friends, of course. They have things to do. So do I. EOS 3 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yes, you have to be positive at all time and always do something that makes you happy. EOS 3 0 12 I' m trying to be positive. It doesn' t seem to work. I don' t know how to change my mood without chemicals. EOS 3 1 13 [Providing Suggestions or Information] have you try yoga or meditating as a therapy.

EOS 3 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] yoga is not expensive and meditation doesn' t have to be with anyone, you can use YouTube video as your tutor. It has work for soo many people including my self.
1 0 0 im very upset. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry. Would you like to tell me about it? EOS 1 0 2 yes. i invited my friend over to watch my new puppy while i painted my room because my dog has seperation anxiety and can' t be alone. then she showed up with her new boyfriend. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] What bothered you about that? EOS 1 0 4 well i dont know him and my stuff was all out in the living room where he was alone for most of the day. i actually didnt suspect anything would happen at first. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can see why that would upset you though. Did something happen?

EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m so sorry that happened to you. I would be very upset as well. EOS 1 0 8 i' ve known her for 8 years. but this guy is very new. they' re not even officially together. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Did you speak to your friend about it? EOS 1 0 10 yes, so i called her and asked her if she saw my bag and she got defensive. she started talking about how much money he has and how he doesnt have to steal. EOS 1 1 11 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It is sometimes hard for people to believe someone they care about could do something bad. EOS 1 0 12 but she should care about me more!! she barely knows him. EOS 1 1 13 [Self-disclosure] I have been in a similar situation with a friend and her husband; when he was exhibiiing bad behavior, she did not want to see it in him. I agree that she should value you your friendship more than someone she just met. EOS 1 0 14 last time we went out for brunch, he literally tried to make her pay for it! that' s not the behavior of someone that has money like she claims. she' s delusional. EOS 1 1 15 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are worried about your friend putting her trust into this guy.
3 1 0 [Question] hi how' s it going today? EOS 3 0 1 Hello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. EOS 3 1 2 [Question] i hear you. it has been a hard year. what' s been the biggest challenge for you? EOS 3 0 3 Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over. EOS 3 1 4 [Reflection of feelings] it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future? EOS 3 0 5 Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. EOS 3 1 6 [Providing Suggestions or Information] it' s true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online? EOS 3 0 7 Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. EOS 3 1 8 [Self-disclosure] it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression. EOS 3 0 9 How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? EOS 3 1 10 [Providing Suggestions or Information] the" little black rain cloud" people? LOL I try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it' s our first. EOS 3 0 11 Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon? EOS 3 1 12 [Providing Suggestions or Information] While there is a lot to focus on that is just awful, it has really helped me to look back to the spanish flue of 1918. that pandemic was followed byt he roaring 20s. EOS 3 0 13 I know people thinking the country will collapse soon. Hard to deal with them. EOS 3 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The doomsday people are always around. remeber they mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012. EOS 3 0 15 I have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. Especially during the holidays. EOS 3 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] are you familiar with Mr. Rogers' story about looking for the helpers when things go bad? EOS 3 0 17 No but I did love that show as a kid. EOS 3 1 18 [Question] Family is hard! So many strong emotions and opinions that aren' t always helpful. anyone in particular for you? EOS 3 0 19 My dad and my GF' s dad both have their own opinons on things. EOS 3 1 20 [Providing Suggestions or Information] so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people. EOS 3 0 21 Yes. I also don' t feel like the world will decent into madness, but they do not believe it. EOS 3 1 22 [Question] oooh, that' s hard. are you living at home with your dad? as a mom, i can tell you that the unknown for your children is scary. often fear and lack of control come out sideways. EOS 3 0 23 No but near him and take care of him. EOS 3 1 24 [Self-disclosure] that' s really nice of you. i' m 800+ miles away from my parents. EOS 3 0 25 That is good and bad. I think it is good to talk about though I do feel a little better thank you. EOS 3 1 26 [Providing Suggestions or Information] if i can suggest something that might help - brene brown, a leadership coach and researcher has a great TED talk about shame and vunerability and a CUTE cartoon animal video on yourtube about empathy. EOS 3 0 27 Ok thank you very much. I think this is a good stopping point, so thank you for your help. EOS 3 1 28 [Providing Suggestions or Information] those help me focus on how hard it is for everyone around me and that i should be kinder to them. everyone has their own crap. EOS 3 0 29 Indeed. it helps to have people to talk to right? EOS 3 1 30 [Others] true. stay safe.
0 0 0 Hi. Is anyone there? EOS 0 1 1 [Greeting] Hi there. EOS 0 0 2 Hi I thought you were not going to show. my anxiety level just increased while I was waiting for you.

I have to come up with 100 by next week to meet my minimum charge. on my credit card. EOS 0 1 5 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] So you need to find 100, have limited time to do this and this is causing you anxiety as a result? EOS 0 0 6 yes it sure is. EOS 0 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] Ok, I can tell you are really worried about this and want to find a way to remove the pressure from this situation. EOS 0 0 8 yes any suggestion s. EOS 0 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Do you have any friends or family that you can speak to about this? If they were aware of this issue and how much it is affecting you, they may be able to support.
1 0 0 im very upset. EOS 1 1 1 [Question] I' m sorry. Would you like to tell me about it? EOS 1 0 2 yes. i invited my friend over to watch my new puppy while i painted my room because my dog has seperation anxiety and can' t be alone. then she showed up with her new boyfriend. EOS 1 1 3 [Question] What bothered you about that? EOS 1 0 4 well i dont know him and my stuff was all out in the living room where he was alone for most of the day. i actually didnt suspect anything would happen at first. EOS 1 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] I can see why that would upset you though. Did something happen? EOS 1 0 6 yes, after they left, i started putting my stuff back in my room and realized the purse i keep my nintendo switch in was GONE. EOS 1 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] I' m so sorry that happened to you. I would be very upset as well. EOS 1 0 8 i' ve known her for 8 years. but this guy is very new. they' re not even officially together. EOS 1 1 9 [Question] Did you speak to your friend about it?

EOS 1 1 15 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like you are worried about your friend putting her trust into this guy. EOS 1 0 16 im worried about how i' m going to get my switch back. i dont have money for a new one. im thinking of calling the cops. EOS 1 1 17 [Others] I think if you talk to her again and tell her you are looking out for her best interests it may help open a conversation. If you do end up calling the cops, at least you will have tried to speak with her first. EOS 1 0 18 i should tell her that i am thinking about calling the cops, at least. or maybe not cuz she might tell him. then he can get rid of it. i think she is working with him, maybe, or at least covering for him. EOS 1 1 19 [Question] Knowing your friend, do you really think she would do that?
4 0 0 Well, I have some bad news. I am going to lose my damn job! Can you please help?? EOS 4 1 1 [Question] Im sorrty Im here. EOS 4 0 2 Yes. I am in a crisis at my job. EOS 4 1 3 [Question] why do you think you are going to lose your job. EOS 4 0 4 I have been told so. January 15th is my last day. EOS 4 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand. EOS 4 0 6 I will get pay for the last two weeks of January, 2021. EOS 4 1 7 [Reflection of feelings] That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why? EOS 4 0 8 What do you suppose I do? Looks like the company has been hot hard by COVID - 19 lockdowns. EOS 4 1 9 [Question] How long have you been working there? EOS 4 0 10 I am very sad about this country and my work situation. For 5 years. I work in accounting. EOS 4 1 11 [Self-disclosure] I understand, I have been in a similar situation recently. COVID - 19 really has got us all down. EOS 4 0 12 What a great nation we live in..... a future 3rd world one. Yeah, but I was a good accountant. EOS 4 1 13 [Others] WOW, I' m sure that is a big change for you... EOS 4 0 14 Yeah, I have not told my wife about it just yet. EOS 4 1 15 [Question] I agree, this country has got some issues but we can get through them. Uh, oh, how do you think she will react? EOS 4 0 16 Yeah, I am not sure. I better wait to break the news in 2021. EOS 4 1 17 [Providing Suggestions or Information] The good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there. EOS 4 0 18 And I am not the only one who is losing my job. Seems that all of accounting is going to be getting the axe. It makes me sad.... EOS 4 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] You could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year. Do you have a resume? EOS 4 0 20 Plus, I have a 50 dollar a day spending habit on lottery tickets to one day hit it BIG. Yes, I have a resume that I have not updated just yet. I have a college education and a CPA to boot, but I need one lucky break in life. EOS 4 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Sometimes that will help to get a better perspective on things... taking some time away from everything in order to catch a breath. EOS 4 0 22 Maybe I can spend some quality time with my kids without them knowing I will be out of a job as of 01/ 15/ 2021. It is almost Christmas, too. EOS 4 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I hear ya, I feel like that quite a bit. Like if isn' t one thing it' s another. I' m sure your wife will understand how the economy has gotten and that she knows that it isn' t your fault.
4 1 0 [Question] Hi, how are you today? EOS 4 0 1 im feeling pretty sad today. EOS 4 1 2 [Question] i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about what is bothering you? EOS 4 0 3 its about me and my friend got fight for misunderstanding. EOS 4 1 4 [Restatement or Paraphrasing] It sounds like your feelings are hurt over a misunderstanding you had with a friend is this correct? EOS 4 0 5 yeah thats correct. EOS 4 1 6 [Question] I see i am sorry that it has you feeling down, did you try to talk with your friend to see if you could resolve your feelings? EOS 4 0 7 no he was not responding to me. he just avoiding me. EOS 4 1 8 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe you could send him a message on social media and let him know the argument has your feelings hurt and you would like to try to talk about it when he has time. EOS 4 0 9 thanks but he totally avoiding me he just blocked me and he ignore me. EOS 4 1 10 [Question] how long have you been friends with him? EOS 4 0 11 for 5 years. but he thinks that i have affair with his girlfriend. EOS 4 1 12 [Affirmation and Reassurance] oh yea that can make things difficult, but i think if you keep reaching out you may could talk this over. Did you try to explain to him that his thoughts were not true? EOS 4 0 13 yeah but how should i start because he misjudged me and his girlfriend its a sensitive issue. EOS 4 1 14 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would start off by telling him that you were sorry that he had those thoughts but there is no truth to it and the fact that he does not trust you enough to know that is hurtful to you and her. If that does not work then you might need to take some time to reflect and figure out if that is a friendship worth trying to save, you may find yourself better off without a friend who shows no trust in you. EOS 4 0 15 please give me some suggegtion that what should i do now. EOS 4 1 16 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I would continue trying to reach out to him and until you can get in touch with him maybe find some thing to do to occupy your mind as to where it does not bother you so much. do you have any hobbies? EOS 4 0 17 yeah i like to play football. EOS 4 1 18 [Providing Suggestions or Information] maybe go play some football to get your mind off of it. EOS 4 0 19 yeah sure. EOS 4 1 20 [Reflection of feelings] from chatting with you seem like a nice person, try not to let it get you down.
2 0 0 hi. EOS 2 1 1 [Greeting] Hey! How are you? EOS 2 0 2 trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once:( EOS 2 1 3 [Question] What are these thoughts?:) EOS 2 0 4 Its so stupid. I keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. The thoughts just come so fast. EOS 2 1 5 [Affirmation and Reassurance] Maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life, and you just need to relax for a little while. EOS 2 0 6 tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes I cant controll the thoughts or like I dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing. EOS 2 1 7 [Affirmation and Reassurance] A chemical thing, so maybe you need a counsellor, and then he can assess your problem, and everything will be alright:) EOS 2 0 8 I have one and it helps sometimes. I try to meditate. EOS 2 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. Does it help you? If it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently.
6 0 0 My friends are trying to shame me. How ridiculous.... EOS 6 1 1 [Question] hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? EOS 6 0 2 It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip. My one old friend is the President of a local non - profit. EOS 6 1 3 [Reflection of feelings] well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation. EOS 6 0 4 I am not making much income with the COVID - 19, either. EOS 6 1 5 [Reflection of feelings] it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you. EOS 6 0 6 Two different( so - called) friends of mine need to get a life. EOS 6 1 7 [Providing Suggestions or Information] shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing. EOS 6 0 8 Yeah, people don' t know that just because my two friends go" Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two( so - called) friends? EOS 6 1 9 [Providing Suggestions or Information] definatly not... have you tried explaining your situation to them? EOS 6 0 10 No, they don' t know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID - 19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year. EOS 6 1 11 [Providing Suggestions or Information] well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time? EOS 6 0 12 I might be able to do that. EOS 6 1 13 [Others] unfortunatly it is right now very comen this situation, so no shame for that, EOS 6 0 14 Well, I used to donate a LOT in year' s past. EOS 6 1 15 [Providing Suggestions or Information] a lot of times donating time to help organisatiosn is more valuable then money. EOS 6 0 16 Great point. EOS 6 1 17 [Others] times and situations change so thats ok. EOS 6 0 18 My friends may like to know that I am trading time.... instead of donating money. EOS 6 1 19 [Providing Suggestions or Information] i worked for a non profit and the biggest struggle was to find volunteers to help out. EOS 6 0 20 Yes, you make a good point. EOS 6 1 21 [Providing Suggestions or Information] I feel that is a great donation and if they do not like that tell them money is easy to give time not. EOS 6 0 22 The proble is that some people just want to shame people without knowing their plight. EOS 6 1 23 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Yeah, true, we need to stay above them then in all actuality we don' t know what goes on behind closed doors in their life. sometimes people like that reflect. EOS 6 0 24 I need to think of others ways to contribute that won' t have my friends hating on me. I have pride, too. EOS 6 1 25 [Others] BUt it should be what you want not what your' freinds want. you should be proud of yourself. EOS 6 0 26 Yeah...... EOS 6 1 27 [Providing Suggestions or Information] Hopefully next year will bring better things and maybe even a better friend that does not judge into your life. EOS 6 0 28 The problem is that I am not sure it my friends are going to believe me; I am a well - to - do individual. We can only hope for a better 2021. Not sure how quickly the markets rebound.... EOS 6 1 29 [Others] well if they do not believe you as well you might really need to rethink your friendships and the meaning in those so called freind ships. hopefully soon for all of us, but hold on to the thought of being healthy.
