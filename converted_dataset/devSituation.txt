Me and my girlfriend had a big fight and she admitted to sleeping with her ex.
It started during my childhood, when I was 9 years old, living my father. He had a bad temper and was impatient with me, especially with school. He would raise his voice at me and get physical when I didn't do well in classes. After the age of 10, I ended up living with my mother but I would spend most of my time with my friends because I enjoyed their company more than anything. I started to hate dealing with school because I felt I wouldn't be able to do well in school; I started to get anxiety from dealing with tests and it gotten bad to the point where I couldn't really stay in crowded place as well. Today, I still try my best to tolerate going to college and do my best in classes even when my anxiety comes back.

Ever since the insurgent of Covid-19 ,I was hit hard when I was relieved from my full-time job for a non justifiable reason. I blame it to Covid because business was slow and it affected production. I was so frustrated and I didn't know what next to do as I had past due bills and family to take care of.

It started during my childhood, when I was 9 years old, living my father. He had a bad temper and was impatient with me, especially with school. He would raise his voice at me and get physical when I didn't do well in classes. After the age of 10, I ended up living with my mother but I would spend most of my time with my friends because I enjoyed their company more than anything. I started to hate dealing with school because I felt I wouldn't be able to do well in school; I started to get anxiety from dealing with tests and it gotten bad to the point where I couldn't really stay in crowded place as well. Today, I still try my best to tolerate going to college and do my best in classes even when my anxiety comes back.
