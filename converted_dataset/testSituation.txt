I am frustrated, as I am looking for a job and despite sending in multiple applications and reference letters, employers have not even acknowledged receipt of the materials submitted, much less expressed anything suggesting that I am under consideration for the position.
My set of friends with include 6 close women are falling apart because of not communicating often and not being physically close to one another. It is really weird how being apart from one another can really change strong relationships. I am still close with everyone but I can not say the same about everyone else. We have all known each other for 25 years and it makes me sad and anxious that when we come out corona it won't be the same. Specifically, two of my besties are arguing with each other over a piece of sensitive gossip that was shared outside our group. Someone feels betrayed and I want to help them both without taking sides.
I experience sleepless nights so frequently since I lost my best friend due to Covid 19. I keep on having memories we had growing up together. When I think about this things I cannot sleep sometimes for an entire night.
i want to change my situation and improve but i am so depressed i don't have the energy to look for a job much less perform them adequately. on top of that my town has almost no jobs (2 thousand people in central Kansas)

trying to find a job with good hours
nothing i do pleases my boss
My set of friends with include 6 close women are falling apart because of not communicating often and not being physically close to one another. It is really weird how being apart from one another can really change strong relationships. I am still close with everyone but I can not say the same about everyone else. We have all known each other for 25 years and it makes me sad and anxious that when we come out corona it won't be the same. Specifically, two of my besties are arguing with each other over a piece of sensitive gossip that was shared outside our group. Someone feels betrayed and I want to help them both without taking sides.

Studying for finals can be very stressful, especially when the exam is cumulative of the year's content. Its super pressuring when you grade can teeter on the border of As, Bs, or Cs since the exam is so heavily weighted on the Final Exam.
