As time went on, I did not know what went wrong but he started showing disinterest in matters that concerns me . When it started we had the conversation. I was worried and he assured me nothing was wrong. I later found out with a great dismay that he was going out with one of our high school acquaintances . It really hurt the more when he told me  what I thought we had was over. it shattered me emotional. He went from avoiding my calls to not wanting to see me around. it hurts  me badly. As I recall this am feeling emotional because tit was a terrible period for me.
My partner recently died due to cancer.  Shortly after that my 34 year old daughter was diagnosed with cancer of the brain stem.  Both of my sons and their families live overseas in Japan and South Korea.  I get sad just with a feeling of being overwhelmed and missing my family.

She felt like I haven' t been there for her because I didn't pick up her call. I honestly didn't see her call and definitely would've got back to her, if I saw her call. She said mean and nasty things about me, which I don' t care about. But she did the wrong mistake of bringing my child into the equation, when he had nothing to do with it. I wanted to really beat the crap out of her because not only did she do that, she blocked my number and ran. Like I was beyond pissed.

I asked my friend if she would go to the store with me because I was feeling down and overwhelmed with kids. She said she was too tired so she would have to pass this time. I was angry because I always support her when she is down or needs it. When I need it, she is nowhere to be seen. It's okay I guess for her to be depressed, but no one else can, because she has already monopolized that emotion. How can you ask someone for help when you are feeling depressed when they are depressed themselves?
Nervous about a test in the future because I do not know if I am learning well enough because of lack of in-person teaching.
I was in a relationship with someone that took 5 years. We were planning on building a home together and he liked the idea and promised we would pull through together.

I feel depressed because of the lockdown. I don't know how to get out of it.
My boyfriend broke up with me in a facebook story. He won't tell me why. He won't return my calls or answer my messages. I think it is because I posted something (innocent) that made him jealous. But he is being so cruel. He posts many sad songs to make it seem like he is so hurt by me, but he won't even speak with me. I can't eat or sleep. I'm losing my mind.

I suffered bullying at school. for the simple fact of being not very fat but if stuffed, they called me a cow, they made the expression of a cow, they threw my bag in the trash, I had no friends. It was hard and strong to be able to study there, after that they changed my school, everything was fine until those from the previous school found out where I was studying and the bullying started again. It has had an impact on my life, I believe that even my feelings are the same, I have not been able to forget it.
