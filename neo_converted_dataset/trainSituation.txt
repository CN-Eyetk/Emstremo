Start by mentioning something you like or value about the other person. ... Say what's not working (your reason for the break-up). ... Say you want to break up

Right now dealing with all the shutdowns I have felt pretty depressed. I'm a stay at home mom with 4 kids and its hard to me to manage day to day. My husbands work hours have been reduced and with the kids being home full time I never get a break. I'm always overwhelmed.
I am an anxiety person, when I have test, I'm going to travel, I'm going out and so on I will always have anxiety however I don't think it's goo to have so much anxiety, it's not good for yourself.
I recently broke up with my partner. We have been dating for over 3 years. During this time with COVID and the election, I don't want to be alone. I feel lost.
I am very scare of this pandemic call COVID-19
I have had a lady who has been a friend for one year now. We have been in good terms until recently when she no longer has time for me and she does not explain the reason for the same. I have scheduled several meetings but she turns down my request every time. I dont know what to do at such a time when i need her support the most.
My boyfriend broke up with me in a facebook story. He won't tell me why. He won't return my calls or answer my messages. I think it is because I posted something (innocent) that made him jealous. But he is being so cruel. He posts many sad songs to make it seem like he is so hurt by me, but he won't even speak with me. I can't eat or sleep. I'm losing my mind.
I lost my job 4 month ago and I am running out of money.
I was already having a really bad day, from a run in I had with a very rude lady. Then I received a text from someone who I thought was my friend. She felt like I haven' t been there for her because I didn't pick up her call. I honestly didn't see her call and definitely would've got back to her, if I saw her call. She said mean and nasty things about me, which I don' t care about. But she did the wrong mistake of bringing my child into the equation, when he had nothing to do with it. I wanted to really beat the crap out of her because not only did she do that, she blocked my number and ran. Like I was beyond pissed.
My father will not talk to me anymore because he is obsessed with Trump. So I call him out, and he now does not speak to or acknowledge me. We have been close until this happened, it struck me as bizarre.
Because of my classes going completely online, it's been incredibly hard for me to keep up in my classes. Because of this, my grades are falling dramatically and I'm afraid that I won't be able to continue in college if next semester is also like this. I've tried reaching out to my professors, but most of them have been unhelpful with my situation.
I've dealt with a lot of stress lately, even before the covid 19 was even heard of. It's ongoing now. I have even more now.

My boyfriend and I went on separate vacations with our friends, and he cheated on me while he was away.
I was already having a really bad day, from a run in I had with a very rude lady. Then I received a text from someone who I thought was my friend. She felt like I haven' t been there for her because I didn't pick up her call. I honestly didn't see her call and definitely would've got back to her, if I saw her call. She said mean and nasty things about me, which I don' t care about. But she did the wrong mistake of bringing my child into the equation, when he had nothing to do with it. I wanted to really beat the crap out of her because not only did she do that, she blocked my number and ran. Like I was beyond pissed.

I am worried my child is not keeping up with his class.

When one partner feels that the other isn't fulfilling a requirement, Wadley says, it's important to communicate that.

When one partner feels that the other isn't fulfilling a requirement, Wadley says, it's important to communicate that. If that person's partner isn't willing to try harder to fulfill that need, it's probably time to move on, she says Tell your BF or GF that you want to talk about something important. Start by mentioning something you like or value about the other person. ... Say what's not working (your reason for the break-up). ... Say you want to break up
