I've had a drinking problem for a few years now, and I know that I need to seek help now. I just am having a hard time finding the motivation to, and I'm having a hard time with being worried about being judged for my drinking and other addiction problems.

I'm ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that i've made that have gotten me to this point in my life.
Haven't been able to sleep for weeks.  My mind just won't stop when I try.
I have been struggling since I lost my job. I have been on the lookout for a new job, tried doing menial jobs just to get by, but nothing seems to be available.
Studying for finals can be very stressful, especially when the exam is cumulative of the year's content. Its super pressuring when you grade can teeter on the border of As, Bs, or Cs since the exam is so heavily weighted on the Final Exam. Its depressing that you can do well in all other aspects of the class yet do poorly on the exam and have all that effort be for nothing.

My husband quit his job to stay home with our teenage son who is very difficult and has been in legal trouble.  My husband feels like it is important for him to be home more but this is putting a financial strain on us and our son is causing a lot of emotion conflict.
I had a stable job that the income can support my living and my family's living until Pandemic hit. The company starts to lay off people including me. I had no other experience and it was difficult to find the job outside as the restriction and shut down effect the ability to go outside.
Had an issue with my wife concerning my drinking habits where she complained that I had of late been drinking soo much. There was a confrontation that almost led to a breakup and now we are not talking. The situation is serious
its just a general depression that i can't seem to shake. being put on the bench at my job continuously makes me feel not good at anything.
I've had a drinking problem for a few years now, and I know that I need to seek help now. I just am having a hard time finding the motivation to, and I'm having a hard time with being worried about being judged for my drinking and other addiction problems. I'm worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a rehab will view me, and any one else that I have to share my story with. I'm ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that i've made that have gotten me to this point in my life.
