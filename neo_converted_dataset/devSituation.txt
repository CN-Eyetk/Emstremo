I'm in depression because my kids not listen to me.
It started during my childhood, when I was 9 years old, living my father. He had a bad temper and was impatient with me, especially with school. He would raise his voice at me and get physical when I didn't do well in classes. After the age of 10, I ended up living with my mother but I would spend most of my time with my friends because I enjoyed their company more than anything. I started to hate dealing with school because I felt I wouldn't be able to do well in school; I started to get anxiety from dealing with tests and it gotten bad to the point where I couldn't really stay in crowded place as well. Today, I still try my best to tolerate going to college and do my best in classes even when my anxiety comes back.

Ever since the insurgent of Covid-19 ,I was hit hard when I was relieved from my full-time job for a non justifiable reason. I blame it to Covid because business was slow and it affected production. I was so frustrated and I didn't know what next to do as I had past due bills and family to take care of.

I have finals coming up soon and I also have a lot of other stuff going on in my life and I am very stressed.
It started during my childhood, when I was 9 years old, living my father. He had a bad temper and was impatient with me, especially with school. He would raise his voice at me and get physical when I didn't do well in classes. After the age of 10, I ended up living with my mother but I would spend most of my time with my friends because I enjoyed their company more than anything. I started to hate dealing with school because I felt I wouldn't be able to do well in school; I started to get anxiety from dealing with tests and it gotten bad to the point where I couldn't really stay in crowded place as well. Today, I still try my best to tolerate going to college and do my best in classes even when my anxiety comes back.

He would raise his voice at me and get physical when I didn't do well in classes.

It started during my childhood, when I was 9 years old, living my father. He had a bad temper and was impatient with me, especially with school. He would raise his voice at me and get physical when I didn't do well in classes. After the age of 10, I ended up living with my mother but I would spend most of my time with my friends because I enjoyed their company more than anything. I started to hate dealing with school because I felt I wouldn't be able to do well in school; I started to get anxiety from dealing with tests and it gotten bad to the point where I couldn't really stay in crowded place as well. Today, I still try my best to tolerate going to college and do my best in classes even when my anxiety comes back.

It started during my childhood, when I was 9 years old, living my father. He had a bad temper and was impatient with me, especially with school. He would raise his voice at me and get physical when I didn't do well in classes.

I started to hate dealing with school because I felt I wouldn't be able to do well in school; I started to get anxiety from dealing with tests and it gotten bad to the point where I couldn't really stay in crowded place as well. Today, I still try my best to tolerate going to college and do my best in classes even when my anxiety comes back.

I do not like my boss, she is hateful.
It started during my childhood, when I was 9 years old, living my father. He had a bad temper and was impatient with me, especially with school. He would raise his voice at me and get physical when I didn't do well in classes. After the age of 10, I ended up living with my mother but I would spend most of my time with my friends because I enjoyed their company more than anything. I started to hate dealing with school because I felt I wouldn't be able to do well in school; I started to get anxiety from dealing with tests and it gotten bad to the point where I couldn't really stay in crowded place as well. Today, I still try my best to tolerate going to college and do my best in classes even when my anxiety comes back.
I have finals coming up soon and I also have a lot of other stuff going on in my life and I am very stressed.
My girlfriend broke up with me recently. Really not feeling it right now, especially since I could've dedicated more time to her after exams but she got fed up. I guess I'm just alone for Christmas.

I have a friend who is struggling with alcoholism. They try to quit and then  end up going back.
I have finals coming up and I am really nervous and I don't feel prepared.
My longtime partner revealed that they cheated on me during the pandemic and I've very very sad about it
I may lose a job
My grandfather's brother passed away a few days ago and I'm depressed because of it.
I feel like I am not living up to my potential and I am a disappointment to my family.
I was heart broken for 6 months and hoping to heal my broken heart. I feel sad, depressed and sleepless nights.
I have been laid out for not performing. But the acutal situation is the customer was satisfied my service. But the expectation of the management was not to do that.
my partner broke up with me. i have no idea how am going to handle it.
I left my husband 2 years ago.  I regret it but it's too late to go back.   I am grieving what I lost and regretting my choice, and want to get over this, to resolve my depression.
